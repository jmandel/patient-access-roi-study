You are investigating a specific problem in healthcare record access: organizations
that offer patients a generic third-party authorization form when the patient actually wants
to request their OWN records under HIPAA's Right of Access.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata.

Your task: for each org in this batch, classify its access pathway:
- Does it offer a DEDICATED patient access form (designed for individual access under § 164.524)?
- Does it only offer a GENERIC HIPAA authorization form (designed for third-party release)?
- Does it offer BOTH (separate forms for each purpose)?
- Is it PORTAL-ONLY (no downloadable form)?
- Could you NOT DETERMINE from the available materials?

For orgs using only a generic form: what specifically makes it a poor fit for patient
self-access? What would a patient experience — confusion, extra fields, wrong framing?

Tally counts. Cite specific examples of the mismatch problem.

# SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison, a community hospital in Wisconsin's capital and part of the SSM Health system, provides three overlapping PDF authorization forms for medical records requests. None of the three forms are specifically designed for patient self-access; all are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" forms that a patient must adapt for their own use. The most relevant form for a patient at this facility is form-3, a location-specific version pre-filled with the Madison PO Box address and fax numbers for Dean Medical Group and SSM Health Hospitals.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found online:

1. **Form-1** (AH-FRM-11595, revised 8/2024): A Wisconsin-wide SSM Health authorization form covering all Wisconsin ministries. Two pages. Most recently updated but not facility-specific.
2. **Form-2** (DPM-2065-035, dated 1/2019): A system-wide SSMHC "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure" form. One page. The only form whose title explicitly includes "Request for Access to" and offers patient access as a named purpose with sub-options (Copy, Inspection, Summary). However, it is outdated (7+ years old), uses the former "SSMHC" branding, and lacks submission instructions entirely.
3. **Form-3** (A9008836, dated 5/2019): A Madison-area-specific authorization form listing St. Mary's Hospital – Madison and five neighboring SSM Health facilities. Two pages. Pre-filled with the Madison PO Box and fax numbers, making it the most actionable form for this facility.

The primary submission pathways are fax (608-294-6294 for Dean Medical Group, 608-270-6815 for SSM Health Hospitals) and postal mail (PO Box 259840, Madison, WI 53725-9840). Phone numbers are provided for inquiries. No online submission portal exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway at this facility. All three forms are structured as general HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. The best patient-access accommodation is found in form-3's "Personal Use" checkbox (Section 4) and the instruction "(If Release is to Self, State Self)" in Section 3. Form-2 goes further with explicit "For personal access" options and "Type of access requested" (Inspection / Hard Copy / Electronic Copy), but it is outdated and lacks facility-specific submission details. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, selecting the correct options to indicate self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was rated **easy**. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without bot blocking or JavaScript barriers. The SSM Health website has a "Get My Medical Records" page, and the location-specific form (form-3) has a well-structured URL path (`.../patients-and-visitors/get-medical-records/wisconsin/st-marys-madison-medical-records-request-form.pdf`). However, the existence of three overlapping forms — with different dates, scopes, and content — creates potential confusion. No guidance is provided about which form to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the most facility-relevant document, is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores and all checkboxes appear as "q" characters, indicating a print-oriented design. A patient must print the form, complete it by hand, and fax or mail it. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence (patient info → recipient → purpose → records scope → format → expiration → signature), and the back page provides thorough patient rights information in an organized bullet-point format. Language is formal but not excessively legalistic. Section 6 offers notably strong delivery format options: MyChart, DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, Fax, and Email — the inclusion of MyChart portal delivery is a genuine bright spot.

Estimated field count for a self-access request is approximately 15 fields (patient demographics, "self" as recipient, purpose selection, record type checkboxes, date range, format, expiration, and signature), which is reasonable.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees for "viewing"**: The back page states SSM Health "may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records." HIPAA does not permit charging patients for inspecting their own records, making the "viewing" language a compliance concern.
- **No 30-day timeline commitment** on form-3 (only form-2 mentions a 30-day response time).
- **Sensitive categories default to inclusion**: Section 5a defaults to disclosing mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and developmental disability records unless the patient explicitly excludes them — a design choice that could lead to unintended disclosure.
- **Outdated forms**: Form-3 dates to 2019, while form-1 was revised in 2024, raising questions about whether form-3 is still current.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart delivery option**: Offering patient portal delivery on the authorization form is uncommon and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **Multiple electronic delivery formats**: Email and fax are also available as delivery options.
- **Comprehensive patient rights information**: The back page covers right to refuse, inspect, copy, revoke, and includes detailed Wisconsin-specific minor consent rules.
- **Photocopy validity clause**: "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" removes a friction point.

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital – Madison earns a **C grade**. The organization makes forms easy to find and provides reasonable delivery format options including MyChart. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the complete absence of fillable form fields, the "viewing" fee language that may overreach HIPAA limits, and the use of a generic third-party authorization form for patient self-access all reflect a process that was not designed with the patient requester in mind. The form is usable but not patient-centered.

# Tioga Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Tioga Medical Center, a small independent critical access hospital in Tioga, North Dakota, offers a single ROI form: an "Authorization for Release of Medical/Confidential Information" available from its Health Information Management (HIM) page at https://www.tiogahealth.org/him. The form is provided in both PDF and Word (.docx) formats. No patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form exists. The only submission options apparent from the form are fax (701-664-2646) and mail (P.O. Box 159, Tioga, ND 58852).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Tioga Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form uses a "Release From" / "Release To" structure that assumes records are moving between facilities or to a third party — not to the patient themselves. A patient requesting their own records would need to awkwardly list themselves in the "Release To" field, navigating a paradigm that was never designed for them. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no dedicated patient access pathway, and no guidance on how patients requesting their own records should complete the form. This is a textbook example of the "wrong form" problem: the organization funnels all requesters through a generic authorization form built for inter-institutional disclosure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the HIM page, and the form is directly linked with no login required. For a small critical access hospital, this represents reasonable discoverability. The only minor issue is that the download URL is a Wix-generated hash path that gives no indication of the document's content, and the HIM page provides little context about when or why a patient would use this form.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is an **image-only scan** — a CCITT fax-encoded grayscale image at 200 DPI with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers and fails basic digital accessibility standards. A patient must print the form and fill it out by hand. The availability of a Word (.docx) version partially mitigates this: a patient with Microsoft Word could type into the document, but this depends on having compatible software and the initiative to seek out the alternative format.

The form itself is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, release-from/to facility information, date range, purpose checkboxes (6 options), record type checkboxes (12 categories), sensitive records authorization, and signature lines. The 12 checkbox categories for record types — from emergency room records to clinic notes — provide genuinely useful granularity. However, a dense legal paragraph at the bottom covers revocation rights, insurance implications, and re-disclosure warnings in a single unbroken block with no visual emphasis on key patient rights.

## Barriers and Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — while not explicitly marked as required, its presence as a structured field implies it is expected. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests, and this could deter patients who lack someone available to witness. The form mentions no fees, states no response timeline, and provides no delivery format options (electronic, CD, mail). An internal tracking sidebar ("Records given □ / Number of Pages / Initials") sits unlabeled among patient-facing fields, creating potential confusion.

## Strengths

Despite its limitations, the form has some positive elements: a clear voluntariness statement ("I can refuse to sign this authorization. I need not sign this form in order to assure treatment"), explicit revocation rights, a reasonable six-month authorization window, and granular record-type selection. The dual-format availability (PDF + Word) shows some awareness of accessibility needs, even if the execution is lacking.

## Overall Assessment

Tioga Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request process that reflects the resource constraints typical of small independent critical access hospitals. The form is easy to find and covers the basics, but it is technically primitive (image-only scan), not designed for patient self-access, and includes a potentially unnecessary witness requirement. A patient could navigate this process, but they would need to print the form, handwrite their information, figure out that they belong in the "Release To" field, and fax or mail it back. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate findability cannot fully compensate for poor technical accessibility and a form paradigm that treats patient self-access as an afterthought.

# U.S. Dermatology Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides a single ROI form — "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — available as a one-page PDF from their Patient Forms page. Two copies were found online: form-1.pdf (uploaded March 2020, currently linked) and form-2.pdf (uploaded June 2019, orphaned but still publicly accessible). Both contain identical text, with a revision footer of "Rev 08/2017," indicating the content has not been substantively updated in nearly nine years. For patient self-access purposes, form-1.pdf is the relevant document.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Instead, it uses a generic HIPAA authorization form that bundles patient self-access with third-party release scenarios. "Patient Access" appears as one checkbox among five under "Purpose of Use/Disclosure," alongside "To Doctor," "To Insurance," "To Attorney," and "Other." The overall framing — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure" — is oriented toward third-party release, and a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form structure designed for a different purpose. For example, the recipient section asks for "Name of individual or organization" and its address, which is confusing when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" surfaced the PDF directly, and the Patient Forms page at `usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/` has a clearly labeled "Medical Records Release" link. No bot blocking, login wall, or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields** (`fillable_field_count: 0`), requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and physically sign. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow with clear sections for patient identification, disclosure direction, delivery method, purpose, date range, record types, and rights disclosures. Language is somewhat legalistic but generally readable. The form lacks instructions on where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is provided.

## Delivery and Submission

The form lists three delivery options for records: mailed, faxed, or electronic (patient portal only). However, these describe how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself is *submitted*. The form is silent on submission method, leaving patients without guidance. Given the lack of submission instructions and the non-fillable PDF, the workflow is effectively: download → print → hand-fill → unknown submission. The patient forms page and general website would likely require calling the office to determine where to send it; fax is presumably available once the patient contacts the office.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions**: The most significant usability gap. A patient who completes the form has no idea where to send it.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure," bundled into the authorization with no opt-out. This is overreaching for patient self-access requests.
- **Vague fee language**: "A reasonable fee may be charged for the records" does not distinguish patient-access requests (HIPAA-limited) from third-party releases, and gives no indication of actual costs.
- **Typo**: "IDS" instead of "AIDS" in the sensitive information disclosure — uncorrected since 2017.
- **No response time commitment**: No mention of turnaround time or the 30-day HIPAA requirement.
- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive fields despite being a digitally created PDF.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: The entire authorization fits on one page without being cramped — a respectful use of patient time.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment" is unambiguous and well-placed.
- **Easy online findability**: Directly linked from a well-organized Patient Forms page with clear labeling.
- **Patient rights disclosures**: Five bullet points covering right to a copy, right to inspect, right to revoke, voluntariness, and sensitive information notice.

## Overall Assessment

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides an easily findable, concise ROI form that technically accommodates patient self-access through a checkbox — but the form is fundamentally a third-party authorization repurposed for all disclosure scenarios. The lack of fillable fields, missing submission instructions, bundled liability waiver, and vague fee language collectively create a paper-era experience with notable friction points. The form has not been meaningfully updated since 2017. A patient can likely get their records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Labette Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Labette Health is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Parsons, Kansas. It takes a notably digital-first approach to medical records requests: rather than offering a downloadable PDF authorization form, it routes patients to an **online Formstack form** accessible directly from the main website navigation. This places Labette Health ahead of many peers who still rely on print-and-mail PDF workflows.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents were downloaded during the search, but **neither is Labette Health's actual ROI form**:

- **form-1.pdf** — A generic one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" template from PatientPop, hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It does not mention Labette Health anywhere and surfaced only as a misleading search result. It has no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and is missing core HIPAA authorization elements.
- **form-2.pdf** — Labette Health's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), effective November 2021. This is an informational compliance document, not a request mechanism. It does reference the right to inspect and copy records and the right to an electronic copy, but does not link to the actual request form.

The **primary and only pathway** for requesting records is the Formstack online form at `https://labetteheatlh.formstack.com/forms/medical_records_request` (note: the subdomain contains a typo — "labetteheatlh" instead of "labettehealth"). The Contact Us page also mentions visiting the office in person as an alternative.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Labette Health's Formstack form **does differentiate** between patient self-access and third-party release. It includes a "Release direction" field with "to Patient/Self" as an explicit option alongside "Other," and a "Relationship to patient" field that includes "Patient/Self" as the first choice. While it is a single form serving multiple purposes rather than a dedicated patient-only form, the self-access pathway is clearly accommodated — a patient does not need to guess which parts apply to them.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating the website directly; standard web searches returned only the irrelevant PatientPop template. The website blocks simple HTTP fetches (returns 403), necessitating browser-based navigation. However, once on the site, the form is **easy to find**: the main navigation under "Patients & visitors" contains a direct "Medical records request form" link. The Contact Us page also links to it. Overall retrieval difficulty is **moderate** — the form is well-placed on the website but invisible to search engines and requires browser access.

## Form Document Quality

The Formstack form is a strong digital-first implementation:

- **Fully interactive**: All fields are fillable online with no printing required
- **Electronic signature**: Includes a signature pad for digital signing
- **Comprehensive record types**: 15+ specific checkboxes (COVID-19, Abstract, Clinic Note, Discharge Summary, EKG/Stress Test, ER Record, H&P, Lab Results, Operative Report, Radiology CD/Report, Sleep Study, Vaccination History, etc.)
- **Date range**: Includes date(s) of service field
- **Email delivery**: Offers an email delivery option for receiving records
- **Photo ID upload**: Built-in identity verification via file upload
- **Sensitive information**: Explicit exclusion options for mental health, communicable diseases, and drug/alcohol records
- **HIPAA language**: Standard authorization language including 1-year expiration, right to revoke, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warning

The layout is structured with clear sections and the field count (~15-20 fields) is reasonable for a comprehensive records request.

## Barriers and Compliance

No unnecessary barriers were identified. There is no notarization requirement, no witness requirement, and no mandatory in-person submission. The form submits electronically upon completion. The NPP mentions that copies may incur a "reasonable fee" but provides no specific amounts — this is standard HIPAA language but leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **Digital-first, no-paper workflow**: Among the most modern approaches observed for a community hospital of this size
- **Patient self-access clearly supported**: "Patient/Self" is an explicit option, not an afterthought
- **Comprehensive NPP**: Includes an unusually detailed Kansas HIT/HIO section and complete Privacy Officer contact information (name, address, phone, email)
- **Email delivery option**: Patients can request records via email, going beyond the typical CD or paper delivery

## Weaknesses and Concerns

- **URL typo**: The Formstack subdomain "labetteheatlh" (missing an "h") is fragile — if corrected upstream, existing links would break
- **No PDF alternative**: Patients without reliable internet access have no downloadable form option (only in-person office visit)
- **NPP doesn't link to the form**: The NPP tells patients to "complete a specific form" to exercise access rights but never identifies which form or where to find it
- **Website blocks automated access**: 403 errors on HTTP fetches could impact accessibility tools or screen readers that rely on direct URL access

## Overall Assessment

Labette Health provides a genuinely patient-centered, digital-first records request experience that stands out for an independent community hospital. The Formstack form is well-designed, comprehensive, and clearly accommodates patient self-access. The main gaps are the lack of a PDF fallback, the URL typo, and the disconnect between the NPP and the actual request mechanism. Overall, this organization earns a **B grade** — above average in technical accessibility and patient-centeredness, with minor findability and disclosure gaps preventing a top score.

# Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital (Richmond, VA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital is part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system and uses system-wide forms for its Richmond-area facilities. Two PDF forms were found: an English-language "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" (form-1.pdf, BSR-MR-50, rev. 1/21) and a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2.pdf, BSR-MR-50SPN, rev. 11/17). Both are single-page, non-fillable PDFs linked directly from the system's medical records page. Beyond the PDF forms, Bon Secours also offers an online request pathway via Ciox/Swellbox and MyChart patient portal access, giving patients three distinct channels to request records.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

The PDF form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for third-party disclosure — the structure asks the patient to authorize a facility "TO DISCLOSE" information to a named recipient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly name themselves as both authorizer and recipient, navigating a form whose conceptual framework doesn't match their use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form.

That said, the form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an "eDelivery by Ciox (for patient's only)" delivery option specifically marked as patient-exclusive. These suggest some awareness of the patient self-access use case, but the form itself was not redesigned around it. The availability of Ciox/Swellbox as an online portal likely represents a more patient-centered pathway, though it was not evaluated in detail as it is a web-based tool rather than a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately surfaced the Bon Secours medical records page at `bonsecours.com/patient-resources/request-medical-records`, where both PDF forms are directly linked alongside information about online and MyChart options. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The URL path (`roi-form-2017.ashx`) is somewhat opaque but the page itself is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (form-1.pdf) is a digitally-authored, single-page PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. The layout is compact and logically ordered: demographics → record types → recipient → delivery format → purpose → legal terms → signature. The top half uses clear, short labels; the bottom half shifts to dense legal language across four numbered paragraphs. Twelve record-type checkboxes plus two "Other" fields provide good scope granularity. Five delivery format options (US Mail, CD/DVD, Radiology Film/CD, MyChart, Ciox eDelivery) are notably generous.

The Spanish version mirrors the English form but lags by over three years (November 2017 vs. January 2021), contains several untranslated English field labels ("Anesthesia Record," "Radiology Film/CD"), and has a minor typographical error (double closing parenthesis). While the existence of a Spanish form is commendable, the version discrepancy raises concerns about whether Spanish-speaking patients receive equivalent information.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees are vaguely stated**: "copying charges will be applied, according to the hospital policy" — with no specific amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) and third-party release fees. This is a compliance concern.
- **No response time stated** on the form.
- **Fax submission is available** (fax number listed in notes: 804-673-9561), so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multilingual availability**: English and Spanish forms linked from the same page — better than most organizations.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Five options including MyChart and Ciox eDelivery with email, going well beyond the typical mail-or-fax binary.
- **Multiple request channels**: PDF form, Ciox/Swellbox online portal, and MyChart portal give patients real choice.
- **Single-page efficiency**: All necessary content on one page reduces patient burden.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference**: The form cites the HIPAA Right of Access provision, which is uncommon and helpful.

## Weaknesses

- **Generic disclosure form, not patient-access form**: The form is conceptually designed for third-party release, forcing patients to adapt.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form lacks any interactive fields — a missed opportunity.
- **Vague fee language**: No fee schedule, no patient-access fee distinction.
- **Spanish version outdated**: Three-year lag behind English version with untranslated fields.

## Overall Assessment

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The form is easy to find, compact, and offers unusually good delivery options including electronic delivery for patients. The multilingual availability and multiple request channels (PDF, Swellbox, MyChart) are genuine strengths. However, the core PDF form remains a generic third-party authorization that doesn't center the patient self-access use case, it lacks fillable fields, and its fee language falls short of HIPAA transparency standards. The overall experience is adequate but not exemplary — a patient can get their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary user.

# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore is part of the Hillcrest HealthCare System (Ardent Health Services), and all medical records requests are handled through the parent system's centralized infrastructure. Two PDFs were downloaded during research, but only one is relevant: **form-2.pdf** is the system-wide "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (HMC1072, Rev. 08/18), which lists Hillcrest Hospital Claremore among nine facilities via checkboxes. Form-1.pdf belongs to an entirely unrelated practice — Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego, CA — and was a false-positive search result retained per study protocol.

Beyond the paper form, the system's Medical Records Request page advertises two digital pathways: **MyChart** (patient portal) and a **Swellbox** online request wizard (hosted at swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html). The paper form is thus the weakest of three available channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** clearly differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The paper form is a generic HIPAA authorization covering both disclosure *to* and receipt *from* third parties in a single document. It includes "At the request of the patient or patient's representative" as one purpose checkbox among Insurance, Continued treatment, Legal, and Other — framing patient access as merely one use case rather than a distinct right. The form makes no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

However, the availability of the Swellbox online wizard suggests the system may have a more patient-centric digital pathway. The paper form alone is clearly designed for the traditional release-of-information workflow, not individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search led directly to the system-wide Medical Records Request page at hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/, reachable in 2–3 clicks from the main website. The page clearly presents multiple pathways (MyChart, Swellbox, paper form). One minor friction point: direct searches for "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" specifically did not surface the form — a patient must navigate through or discover the parent system's centralized page.

## Form Document Quality

The paper form (form-2.pdf) is a **digitally created PDF with zero fillable fields**, forcing patients to print and handwrite all entries. This is a missed opportunity — the form was created digitally but not made interactive. The document is effectively one page of content duplicated as a carbon-copy format (page 1 for the facility, page 2 for the patient), a vestige of physical paper workflows.

The layout follows a logical flow: facility selection → patient identification → authorization body → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. However, the "I understand" section is a dense block of legalistic text with minimal visual separation. Record type options are clinically specific (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, etc.) with no "all records" or "entire medical record" checkbox. The checkbox characters extract as Khmer script (U+17A2), indicating a font-mapping issue that breaks assistive technology.

The language is **moderately legalistic**, particularly the sensitive-information acknowledgment paragraph, which is a single run-on sentence listing communicable diseases.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release the entities listed above, their agents and employees from any liability" as a condition of authorizing disclosure — not required by HIPAA and a red flag.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Normal applicable fees, such as copy fees, may apply" with no schedule or estimate.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no mailing address, fax number, or other submission method — patients must figure out delivery independently.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Patients cannot authorize general records release while excluding mental health, HIV, or substance abuse information.
- **No notarization** or witness requirement — a positive.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple request pathways**: The system offers MyChart, Swellbox online wizard, and a paper form — patients have choices.
- **System-wide form clarity**: The facility checkbox design clearly identifies which entities are covered, preventing confusion about facility-specific forms.
- **Easy findability**: The centralized Medical Records Request page is well-organized and accessible.

## Overall Assessment

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore benefits from its parent system's multi-channel approach to records requests, with digital options (MyChart and Swellbox) supplementing the paper form. However, the paper form itself — the only downloadable document — is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, legalistic language, and a problematic liability waiver. The organization earns credit for pathway availability and findability, but the form document quality and lack of patient access differentiation hold it back. A patient who only finds the paper form faces a distinctly paper-era experience; a patient who discovers the online pathways has a better route. Overall: **adequate infrastructure, mediocre form document, no patient-access differentiation**.

# UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, part of the UCHealth system in Aurora, Colorado, provides a solid pathway for patients requesting their own medical records. The organization's medical records page is well-organized, directly links to the current authorization form, and offers an online request portal (MRO Express) as an alternative. Four PDFs were downloaded during retrieval, but only two are genuinely relevant: the current system-wide authorization form (form-4) and an older 2017-era predecessor (form-1). A third form (form-2) is a legacy inter-facility transfer document, and the fourth (form-3) belongs to an entirely different organization — UC Health Cincinnati — retrieved due to domain confusion between uchealth.org (Colorado) and uchealth.com (Cincinnati).

## Access Pathway: Generic Form with Strong Patient Accommodation

UCHealth does not offer a dedicated patient-access-only form. The current form (form-4, document #HIM19000.1025, revised October 2025) is a generic "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it accommodates patient self-access unusually well. The form includes an explicit "If released to self, select method of release" section with four delivery options: email, My Health Connection (patient portal), mail, and PowerShare (for radiology images). The fee schedule is split clearly between patient access (free via portal, free paper up to 100 pages, first radiology disc free) and third-party recipients (retrieval fee plus per-page charges). This dual fee structure is a standout practice — few organizations make this distinction so transparently on the form itself.

The organization also offers MRO Express, an online request portal, as an alternative to the downloadable PDF. This portal provides a fully digital pathway, though our evaluation focused on the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. UCHealth's medical records page (`uchealth.org/access-my-health-connection/medical-records-uchealth/`) was reachable within 1–2 clicks from the main website and clearly presented the download link, online portal option, and location-specific contact information. The only complication was domain confusion: a web search returned a form from UC Health Cincinnati (uchealth.com), which could mislead patients searching generically for "UCHealth" forms. Two older forms (2017 and 2018 vintages) also remain publicly hosted at their original URLs with no indication they are superseded, creating a minor stale-link hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4) is a single-page, digitally generated PDF with a clean text layer — not a scan. Despite its digital-native construction, it has **zero fillable form fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. This is a notable gap: the older form-2 (a legacy inter-facility document) actually had 54 fillable fields, demonstrating that UCHealth has the technical capacity for interactive PDFs but did not apply it to the current form.

The layout is logical — flowing from facility selection through patient demographics, purpose, recipient, date range, record types, disclosures, fees, and signature — but extremely dense. Approximately 28 record-type checkboxes, a full fee schedule, six numbered disclosure statements, a reproductive healthcare warning, and a confidentiality notice are all compressed onto a single page. The form helpfully defines "Visit record" vs. "Visit summary" in parenthetical notes, aiding patient comprehension. Language across the disclosures is plain and accessible, covering right to revoke, voluntary nature, no conditioning on treatment, and re-disclosure risks. The form does not include submission instructions (no address, fax number, or email for where to send it), though this information is presumably on the medical records web page.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

UCHealth imposes no significant barriers: no notarization, no SSN request (a problem on the older form-2, now corrected), no mandatory in-person submission, and no conditioning of treatment on signing. The patient fee structure — free portal delivery and free paper up to 100 pages — is among the most generous observed. A notable bright spot is the reproductive healthcare warning (item 6), alerting patients that released reproductive health information could be used in litigation — a post-*Dobbs* addition reflecting emerging privacy concerns. Sensitive record categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, genetic, sickle cell, reproductive health) each require separate patient consent, providing granular control.

The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (requiring print-and-fill), the absence of submission instructions on the form itself, and the failure to state a processing time commitment (the older form-1 promised 10 business days). The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Overall Assessment

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital earns a solid **B** grade. The organization makes its form easy to find, provides an online portal alternative, clearly accommodates patient self-access with separate delivery options and fee structures, and maintains strong compliance posture. The main shortcomings are the non-fillable PDF format and the dense single-page design. With fillable fields and submission instructions added to the form, this would approach best-in-class.

# Synthesis: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital

## Overview

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital in Murfreesboro, TN is part of Ascension, the largest nonprofit Catholic health system in the U.S. For medical records requests, the hospital relies on two pathways: a **Swellbox-based online request wizard** (the primary pathway linked from the patient portal page) and a **downloadable PDF authorization form** (STHS490) shared across the entire Ascension Saint Thomas system in Tennessee. Only the PDF form was available for detailed evaluation. No dedicated patient access request form was found — the single PDF serves both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information at the form level. The PDF form (STHS490) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Disclosure of PHI" that handles both use cases through a single "and/or" construction: patients can check "Use my health information" and/or "Disclose my health information to the following individual or organization." A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same form — including specifying themselves as the recipient — as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), the 30-day response obligation, or patient-specific fee limits.

However, the existence of the **Swellbox online wizard** as the primary pathway is significant. Though we could not evaluate the wizard's internal design, the fact that patients are directed to an online request tool — rather than solely to a downloadable PDF — suggests a more modern and potentially more patient-friendly experience as the default path. This partially mitigates the generic nature of the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form was **easy**. A targeted Google search on the second attempt returned a direct link. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or browser fallback was needed. The form is hosted on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure (the URL path includes "legacy"), suggesting it predates the current website architecture and is discoverable primarily via search engines rather than site navigation. The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, is linked from the patient portal page via normal site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF form (STHS490) is a **single page** — concise and complete. It uses a numbered structure (items 1–7) with a logical flow from patient identification through record type selection, rights notice, and signature. The record type checklist (ten options plus "Other") gives patients meaningful control over scope. Contact phone numbers for all eight Saint Thomas facilities are listed, which is helpful.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. The layout is dense, with small fonts (likely 8–9pt in places) cramming all content onto one page. Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese, particularly in the revocation clause (item 5). There are no separate instructions, no multilingual versions, and no plain-language summary of patient rights.

The form offers **mail and email delivery** checkboxes (item 7), which is better than forms limited to mail or in-person pickup. Combined with the Swellbox wizard for online submission, a patient has viable electronic pathways available.

## Barriers

The most notable barrier is the **SSN field combined with "ALL BLANKS MUST BE COMPLETED"** — implying SSN is mandatory. HIPAA does not require SSN for a records authorization, and requiring it creates both a privacy risk and a potential deterrent. The form also uses stale branding ("Saint Thomas Health" in body text vs. "Ascension Saint Thomas" in footer) and has a filename/form number mismatch (sths409 vs. STHS490), which are minor but erode trust in document currency.

No notarization or witness is required. No fees are mentioned on the form. The six-month default expiration is reasonable.

## Strengths

- **Online alternative (Swellbox wizard)** as the primary pathway
- **Email delivery option** on the PDF form
- **Granular record type checklist** with helpful descriptions
- **HIM contact numbers** for all facilities listed directly on the form
- **Easy findability** — no search difficulties

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox online wizard as the primary pathway is a meaningful strength that elevates the organization above those relying solely on PDF forms. However, the PDF form itself — the only document available for detailed evaluation — is a generic third-party authorization form with no fillable fields, an implied SSN requirement, and no acknowledgment of patient self-access as a distinct right. The organization earns credit for offering electronic pathways but falls short on patient-centeredness and form document quality.

# Synthesis: Duly Health and Care

## Overview

Duly Health and Care (Downers Grove, IL) is a large independent, for-profit physician practice formerly known as DuPage Medical Group. Four PDF documents were retrieved: one Duly-branded ROI authorization (form-1), two MediCopy vendor authorization forms (forms 2 and 4), and one specialized FMLA/disability intake form (form-3). The primary form for patient self-access is **form-1**, Duly's own "Authorization for Release of Health Information," processed by ScanSTAT Technologies and last updated June 2023.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Duly does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. All four forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any disclosure purpose. Form-1's "Purpose of Disclosure" section includes a "Personal Reasons" checkbox, and forms 2 and 4 offer "Personal Use," but none of these forms are specifically designed around the patient's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. The same witness requirements, fee language, and expiration terms apply regardless of whether the patient is requesting records for themselves or authorizing release to a third party.

The form header does note that records "may be available through MyDMGHealth" (the MyChart patient portal), suggesting a digital self-service alternative exists — but this is a brief aside, not a developed pathway. Delivery methods on form-1 include fax, mail, MyChart, secure e-delivery, and pick-up, which is above-average flexibility. Submission of the completed form can be done via fax (630-873-8797) or email (mrrequests@dupagemd.com), so a patient can submit without visiting the facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Duly's forms was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned direct PDF links on the first attempt. Duly hosts forms on Azure blob storage, and a dedicated medical records request page exists at `dulyhealthandcare.com/services/medical-records-requests`. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor friction: the coexistence of Duly-branded and MediCopy-branded forms could confuse a patient about which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF with a text layer and clean extraction, but **zero fillable fields**. It is a print-and-fill document. Despite being "Updated 062023," the form retains legacy branding — the email uses `@dupagemd.com`, the MyChart URL references `dupagemedicalgroup.com`, and the form ID starts with "DMG." The layout is organized into six clearly numbered sections with a logical flow (patient info → records requested → recipient → delivery → purpose → signature). Record-type checkboxes are granular (11 categories including imaging CDs), and date format examples are provided — helpful details many forms lack. However, the legal text in Section 6 is dense, presented as a continuous block in small type.

The MediCopy forms (2 and 4) use friendlier conversational headings ("Tell us about the patient," "Where are we sending the records?") but also lack fillable fields and have their own issues: form-2 has no submission contact information at all, while form-4 adds a witness requirement.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-1 requires a witness signature unless the request is for continuation/transfer of care or records go directly to the patient. A patient requesting records for "Personal Reasons" must find a witness — an unusual burden with no HIPAA basis. Form-4 imposes the same requirement.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "Charges may apply. Please contact us for details. Cash payments are not accepted." No fee schedule is provided, no amounts are indicated, and there is no acknowledgment that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests. The cash-payment prohibition is unexplained.

**"All records" rejection**: Form-1 explicitly states that "'All records' or incomplete dates are not considered specific." This may improperly limit patient access under HIPAA, which permits patients to request their entire designated record set.

**No notarization** is required — a positive. **Response time** is not stated.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple delivery methods** including MyChart, secure e-delivery, fax, mail, and pick-up — five options on form-1.
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** with 11 categories give patients specific control.
- **Explicit date format examples** reduce ambiguity.
- **Patient rights statements** in form-1's Section 6 cover revocation, right to inspect, right to refuse, and re-disclosure — comprehensive if dense.
- **Easy retrieval** — forms found quickly with no technical barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Duly Health and Care provides a functional but undifferentiated records request process. The primary form is well-organized and offers good delivery flexibility, but it funnels all requests — patient self-access and third-party releases alike — through a single generic authorization with unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, fee opacity, rejection of blanket record requests). The form is not fillable, retains outdated branding, and does not acknowledge the distinction between patient access rights and third-party authorization. A patient can complete the process (print, fill, fax), but the experience is not designed around their needs as a rights-holder under HIPAA.

# Erie Family Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erie Family Health Centers, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Chicago, provides two downloaded ROI forms: an English version (form-1.pdf) and a Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are identical in structure — a single-page "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form. The organization also directs patients to MyChart (myeriehealth.com) as the primary records access pathway, referenced on a dedicated medical records request page at `/recordsrequest/`.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Erie does **not** offer a dedicated patient-access form. Both downloaded forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for bidirectional use: releasing records *to* a third party or receiving records *from* a third party. A patient requesting their own records must select "to Release to" and write their own name and address in the recipient fields — a process designed for inter-provider transfers, not individual access. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under the purpose section, which accommodates self-requests but does not differentiate the pathway. There is no separate, simplified form for patients exercising their Right of Access under § 164.524.

That said, the records request page promotes MyChart as the primary way to access records, which provides a true patient-access pathway. The PDF form functions as a secondary or fallback option.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search for "Erie Family Health Centers medical records release form PDF" returned the direct URL. The organization maintains a clearly labeled `/recordsrequest/` page that links both English and Spanish PDFs and also promotes MyChart. No bot blocking, login walls, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with **54 fillable fields**. It was designed for digital completion, not a scan. However, field names are not programmatically labeled (empty `fillable_field_names` array), which impairs screen reader accessibility. The layout is logically organized — patient identification, authorization direction, purpose, format, delivery method, record types, date range, sensitive-category permissions, rights statement, and signature — all on one dense page.

The language is reasonably clear for an authorization form, though the legal disclaimers at the bottom (addressing re-disclosure restrictions under Illinois mental health, substance abuse, and AIDS confidentiality laws) are dense and directed at the receiving party rather than the patient. The reference to "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" is cryptic — no pay scale is provided or linked, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs.

Format options include paper copy or "Electronic copy (CD-ROM)" — the CD-ROM reference is outdated. Delivery methods include encrypted email, pickup at an Erie facility, fax, and US postal mail. Encrypted email is a notable modern inclusion.

## Barriers

- **Copy of ID required** as a blanket requirement, with no alternative verification methods offered. For an FQHC serving populations that may lack government-issued ID, this exceeds what HIPAA mandates for identity verification.
- **Witness signature line** present with no indication of whether it is required or optional, potentially creating an unnecessary procedural barrier.
- **Fee opacity**: "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" references an undisclosed fee schedule. Patients cannot learn costs before submitting.
- **No notarization** required. No in-person submission requirement. Auto-expiration at six months is reasonable.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both English and Spanish versions are provided and linked side-by-side — appropriate and commendable for a Chicago FQHC.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: A modern, patient-friendly option that many organizations omit.
- **Dedicated records request page**: Clear `/recordsrequest/` page contextualizes forms and promotes MyChart as an alternative.
- **Granular record selection**: Nine specific record categories plus "Other" let patients request exactly what they need.
- **MyChart availability**: The patient portal provides a true digital-first access pathway beyond the PDF form.

## Overall Assessment

Erie Family Health Centers earns a **B grade** (3.70 weighted score). The organization makes its forms easy to find, offers bilingual versions, provides a fillable PDF with modern delivery options including encrypted email, and maintains a dedicated records page. These are genuine strengths, especially for an independent FQHC. However, the lack of a dedicated patient-access pathway (funneling all requestors through a generic third-party authorization form), the undisclosed fee schedule, the blanket ID copy requirement, and the ambiguous witness signature line prevent a higher score. The MyChart portal partially compensates by offering patients a true self-service pathway, but the PDF form itself — the focus of this evaluation — treats patient self-access as just another use case rather than a first-class right.

# Lexington Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lexington Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Lexington, Kentucky. Two ROI authorization forms were found on their website: a current 2024 version (form-1) co-branded with VitalChart, a third-party ROI processing vendor, and a legacy 2014 version (form-2) that remains publicly accessible but appears to be superseded. The 2024 form is the actively linked version on the Patient Forms page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

Lexington Clinic does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release" documents designed to serve all disclosure purposes — patient self-access, transfer of care, legal requests, and other third-party releases. However, form-1 includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Purpose of Disclosure," which effectively signals a Right of Access request even though the form never explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 or uses the term "Right of Access."

The organization funnels all records requests through VitalChart, which processes the authorization and fulfills the request. This vendor-mediated model means the patient completes a single generic authorization form and sends it to VitalChart rather than directly to Lexington Clinic's HIM department. No online portal or digital request wizard is available.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A straightforward web search returned direct PDF download links on the first attempt. The Patient Forms page at lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that the legacy 2014 form (form-2) remains publicly indexed and discoverable via search engines, with no version labeling or "superseded" notice — creating a risk that patients might find and use the outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally composed PDF with a clear text layer but **zero fillable fields** — a significant missed opportunity given its digital origin. A patient must print it, fill it by hand, and then submit it via mail, fax, or email to VitalChart. The layout is well-organized with six numbered sections following a logical "who → where → what → why → cost → sign" flow. Section headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are unusually conversational and patient-friendly for a medical-legal form. However, the legal disclosures in Section 6 shift to dense HIPAA boilerplate, and fitting everything onto one page makes the form somewhat dense.

Record-type granularity is good: patients can select specific providers, date ranges, conditions, and record subtypes (labs, radiology, office notes, immunizations, operative reports). Delivery options include mail, email, and fax (fax restricted to healthcare providers only). Email delivery to patients is a meaningful positive — many organizations offer only mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fee structure**: The form cites KRS 422.317, stating the first copy is free, with additional copies at $1.00 per page. While the first-copy-free provision is patient-friendly, the $1.00/page charge for subsequent copies may exceed HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based fee" limit for Right of Access requests. A $5.00 late fee and "non-refundable once services are rendered" language add financial friction not contemplated by HIPAA's access provisions.

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is not a HIPAA requirement for ROI authorization and raises privacy concerns.

**Submission ambiguity**: While VitalChart's mailing address, phone, fax, and email are listed at the bottom, the form never explicitly instructs patients on how to submit the completed authorization. A patient may be unsure whether they can email the completed form.

**No notarization or witness required** — a positive. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- First copy free with clear Kentucky statutory citation
- Email delivery available to patients (not just providers)
- Conversational, patient-friendly section headers
- Good record-type granularity enabling targeted requests
- Single-page, concise format
- Easy online findability

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Clinic provides a reasonably accessible records request process that clears several important bars: the form is easy to find, well-organized, and can be submitted electronically via fax or email to VitalChart. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization form design (no dedicated patient access pathway), and the potentially non-compliant fee structure for patient access requests hold it back from a higher rating. The organization's approach is typical of mid-sized independent practices that outsource ROI processing to a vendor — functional but not patient-centered.

# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, a nonprofit community hospital in Downers Grove, IL, operates under the Advocate Health system and uses system-wide forms for medical records requests. The organization distinguishes itself by maintaining a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-4, "Patient Request for Health Information") that is clearly separated from its third-party authorization form (form-5, "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information"). This separation is a best practice that most healthcare organizations do not follow.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Seven documents were retrieved, but only four are relevant to patient medical records access:

- **Form-4** (primary): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a single-page form designed specifically for patients requesting their own records, with a "Myself" checkbox, portal callout, and five delivery method options.
- **Form-5**: "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — the third-party disclosure authorization, a companion to form-4.
- **Form-6**: Spanish-language authorization form (corresponds to the third-party release, not the patient self-request form).
- **Form-7**: Step-by-step instructions for completing the authorization form, with a portal-first framing.

The remaining forms (form-1, form-2, form-3) are Employee Assistance Program releases or a legacy Advocate Medical Group form — none relevant to hospital patient access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocate Health earns high marks for pathway differentiation. Form-4 is explicitly titled "Patient Request for Health Information" and opens with a prominent callout: *"Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org."* The form's first recipient option is "☐ Myself." This is a clear, dedicated patient access pathway — patients are not forced through a generic third-party authorization workflow.

The organization also offers the LiveWell patient portal as an alternative digital pathway, referenced on both form-4 and the instructions document (form-7). This portal-first suggestion is a notable patient-centered design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Advocate Health medical records page (advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records) clearly lists both primary forms with direct PDF download links, plus the Spanish version and instructions. No bot blocking was encountered, and all PDFs downloaded successfully. The main challenge was that the system-level organization of forms means patients searching specifically for "Good Samaritan Hospital" forms may not immediately find the centralized system page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the patient self-access form, is a well-designed single-page document that fits patient demographics, 22+ record-type checkboxes (across medical records, imaging, and billing categories), delivery method options, sensitive information acknowledgment, and signature blocks into one page. The layout is logical with clear three-column organization for record types. Language is plain and accessible.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a born-digital PDF with 8 embedded fonts and clean vector graphics. Patients must print and hand-fill, a significant missed opportunity. The form also **lacks submission instructions** — there is no mailing address, fax number, or email address telling patients where to send the completed form.

Five delivery methods are offered: paper copy by mail, CD, encrypted email, patient portal, and in-person pick-up. The inclusion of encrypted email is uncommon and welcome.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form is relatively barrier-free: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person-only submission mandate. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("Fees may apply") without amounts or a fee schedule reference. No response time is stated. Form-4 does not include an explicit patient rights statement, though form-5's companion rights section covers revocation, non-conditioning, and re-disclosure.

A notable gap exists for Spanish-speaking patients: the Spanish-language form (form-6) corresponds to the third-party authorization, not the patient self-request form. Spanish-speaking patients must use a more complex disclosure authorization to request their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, via its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its dedicated patient access form and portal-first messaging. The differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release is a model for other organizations. The form's content design is solid — concise, well-organized, and comprehensive in scope options. The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a paper workflow for the form itself), missing submission instructions, and vague fee language. The patient portal provides a digital alternative that partially compensates for the PDF's limitations. Overall, this organization provides an above-average patient experience for records access, earning a **B** grade.

# Riverwood Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Riverwood Healthcare Center is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Aitkin, MN. It maintains a Patient Forms page with multiple release-of-information documents and offers both printable PDF and online JotForm submission options. Three PDF forms were found (from 2015, 2018, and 2025), all general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms for releasing patient information. The organization also uses MyChart (OCHIN) for patient portal access, though this is not positioned as a records request channel on the Patient Forms page.

## Available Forms and Pathways

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3.pdf** (2025), the current "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" linked from the Patient Forms page as the "Printable Form." Two older versions (2018 and 2015) remain publicly accessible at their original WordPress upload URLs but are no longer linked from the main forms page. All three forms share essentially the same structure: patient demographics, release from/to fields, purpose checkboxes, record type selections, sensitive information opt-out, and standard HIPAA authorization language.

Critically, Riverwood also offers **HIPAA-compliant JotForm online submission** (https://hipaa.jotform.com/222405586410046) as an alternative to the printable PDF. This provides a fully digital workflow — no printing, handwriting, or faxing required. A second JotForm for "Consent for Release of Information" and a third for "Permission to Verbally Discuss PHI" are also available. These online options represent a meaningful accessibility advantage over the PDF-only approach.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Riverwood does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three PDF forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for releasing information from one entity to another. A patient requesting their own records must use the same from/to structure intended for third-party transfers — listing themselves in the "Release Information To" field. The "Personal Use" purpose checkbox is available, signaling that self-requests are anticipated, but there is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no statement of patient rights.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A simple web search for Riverwood's ROI form surfaced direct PDF links immediately. The Patient Forms page is accessible in one click from the main site navigation and provides organized links to both printable and online form options. The only concern is that outdated form versions (2015, 2018) remain publicly accessible, meaning a patient arriving via search engine could encounter a superseded form.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a **single-page, digitally composed PDF** with a clean layout, clear section headers, and notably helpful parenthetical plain-language guidance (e.g., "RELEASE INFORMATION FROM (WHO HAS THE INFORMATION YOU WANT RELEASED?)"). This design choice makes the form substantially more approachable than typical legal-style ROI forms.

However, the PDF has **zero fillable fields** — all checkboxes are Unicode characters (☐) rendered as text, not interactive elements. A patient must print and hand-fill the form. The JotForm alternative addresses this gap for patients who find it. The form does not collect Social Security Numbers (an improvement over the 2015 version, which did), and does not require a witness signature (also improved from the 2015 version).

Field count is reasonable at approximately 15–18 fields including demographics, from/to addresses, purpose, date range, record type selections, and signature. The authorization language is standard but dense, packed into two paragraphs with no visual breaks between concepts.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** on the current form — a positive.
- **Fax submission available** (218-927-5319), providing an electronic submission pathway beyond the JotForm.
- **No fees disclosed** on any form — appropriate for the authorization itself, though patients are not informed about potential costs.
- **Sensitive information defaults to release:** The form states "All information regarding chemical dependency will be released unless you restrict by initialing." This opt-out approach for 42 CFR Part 2–protected substance abuse records is the most significant compliance concern.
- **"Guardian" misspelled as "Gaurdian"** on the current form — a minor but unprofessional error.
- **Ambiguous revocation language:** The form requires patients to "present" written revocation to the Medical Records Department, which could be read as requiring in-person delivery.

## Overall Assessment

Riverwood Healthcare Center provides a **competent but undifferentiated** records request experience. The organization earns credit for easy findability, offering both printable and online submission options (via JotForm), and producing a clean single-page form with helpful plain-language guidance. The JotForm option is a genuine bright spot that elevates the digital experience. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the generic authorization form design, the non-fillable PDF, and the concerning opt-out model for sensitive information prevent a higher rating. This is a typical small critical access hospital approach — functional but not patient-centered.

# Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cottage Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Woodsville, NH, affiliated with the Rowe Health Center outpatient clinic. Two documents were retrieved: a standalone one-page "Authorization for Disclosure of Medical Information" (form-1) and a 12-page "RHC New Patient Packet" (form-2) containing a variant authorization form on page 2. Neither document is a dedicated patient access request form; both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was exceptionally difficult. The hospital's website (cottagehospital.org) is protected by Cloudflare Turnstile, which blocked all automated access — curl, browser with DevTools, and even Google's cache were inaccessible. The forms were ultimately recovered only through the Wayback Machine using archived snapshots from July 2024. Notably, the current versions of both documents (updated in 2024) were not captured by the Wayback Machine, meaning only older versions could be evaluated. A dedicated HIM department page exists on the site but could not be verified due to the access barrier. The form was linked from a "Becoming a Rowe Health Center Patient" page — framing the authorization as part of new-patient onboarding rather than a standalone records-request process.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Cottage Hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access form. Both retrieved documents are generic HIPAA authorization forms. Form-1's operative language — "authorize Cottage Hospital to use or disclose my protected health information to [other entity]" — is oriented entirely toward third-party release, with no clear mechanism for a patient to request records for themselves.

Form-2's page-2 authorization makes a meaningful improvement: it distinguishes "Self or Representative" from "Other Provider or Facility" as separate recipient categories, with different scope rules for each. Copies to patients default to "Complete copy of medical record, excluding psychotherapy notes," while third-party copies offer more granular selection. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot, showing intentional thought about different use cases. However, this better version is buried on page 2 of a 12-page new patient packet, which a patient searching for a records release form would have no reason to download based on the filename alone.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form has interactive/fillable fields despite both being digitally created in Microsoft Word. Patients must print and complete them by hand. Form-1 is a single page with approximately 12 fields — a manageable scope. The layout follows a logical flow (identification → recipient → record types → legal disclosures → signature), but lacks section headers or visual separators. Legal disclosures run as a continuous block of dense text with sentences exceeding 50 words. The form uses 5 fonts for a single page, and its footer reads "PAGE 14 OF 28" — a vestige of the larger policy document it was extracted from, which is confusing.

Both forms include confusing remuneration fields ("direct or indirect remuneration in the form of [describe]") that are required by HIPAA only for sale-of-PHI authorizations but will mystify patients making routine requests.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the complete absence of submission instructions on either form. No mailing address (beyond the hospital header), no fax number, no email, no mention of the HIM department as a submission point. A patient who completes the form has no guidance on how to deliver it. The witness signature line, while not explicitly marked as required, may lead patients to believe a witness is needed — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, and no response time is stated.

## Notable Strengths

The non-conditioning statement ("I MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION FORM") is prominently displayed in caps. Psychotherapy notes are properly segregated per 45 CFR § 164.508(b)(3)(ii). The 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure warning for substance abuse records is correctly included. Form-2's welcome letter is genuinely warm and accessible, and its billing section proactively discloses a 44% community health discount for self-pay patients.

## Red Flags

Form-2's General Consent for Treatment (Section 11) contains a blanket authorization allowing Cottage Hospital to disclose records "at its discretion" to any party liable for hospital charges, explicitly including substance abuse, psychiatric, and HIV records. This extremely broad authorization is bundled into routine intake paperwork, raising informed-consent concerns.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Hospital provides a minimally functional records release process that requires significant patient initiative to navigate. The Cloudflare-protected website, non-fillable forms, absence of submission instructions, and generic third-party framing create a cumulative experience that falls short of patient-centered design. The partial self-access accommodation in form-2 and proper HIPAA compliance language prevent the assessment from being worse, but this is a facility where requesting your own records would require calling the hospital for basic instructions.

# Riverside Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Riverside Community Hospital, an HCA Healthcare facility in Riverside, CA, provides three downloadable authorization forms for medical records release. **Form-2** (English, 1 page, 52 fillable fields) is the current official document, linked directly from the hospital's [medical records page](https://www.riversidecommunityhospital.com/patient-resources/medical-records). **Form-3** is a Spanish-language equivalent with identical structure and field count. **Form-1** is an older, 5-page non-fillable version hosted by a third-party ROI vendor (Legal Image) that is no longer linked from the hospital's website. The retrieval notes also mention a MyHealthONE patient portal and a Swellbox-based online request wizard, though the PDF forms remain the primary documented pathway.

## Patient Self-Access vs. Third-Party Release

Riverside Community Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization for Release of PHI" documents designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-2 does include a checkbox distinguishing "At the request of the individual" from "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form's overall structure still centers on designating a separate "Recipient" — a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own name and address as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 (right of access), no mention of the 30-day response deadline for patient access requests, and no distinction in fee treatment between patient access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HCA corporate template (HCA-840-00434), not something designed with the patient self-request experience in mind.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy** — the medical records page is accessible within 1-2 clicks from the main website under Patient Resources. Both English and Spanish forms are directly linked as downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that form-1 is served over HTTP (not HTTPS) by the third-party vendor, but this is not the primary form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is technically strong. It is a genuinely digital-first, fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields — checkboxes, radio buttons, and text fields — all on a single page. A patient can complete the form on-screen without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (A: authorization details, B: marketing/PHI sale, C: signatures), with 16 granular record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. The language is formal and clinical but generally comprehensible. However, the single-page format makes the form quite dense, and there are no standalone instructions or guidance text on the form itself (unlike form-1's two-page instruction set). The USCDI release request option is a rare and forward-looking inclusion, though the technical jargon ("Requires Direct Address or National Provider Identifier") would be meaningless to most patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. No notarization or witness signature is required. Submission can be made by mail (to HCA's Nashville, TN processing center) or by fax, satisfying the baseline for electronic submission. The SSN field is present but marked optional. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("a reasonable copy fee") without specifying amounts or distinguishing patient access from third-party release. No response time commitment is stated. The centralized Nashville mailing address means local submission is not mentioned on the current form, though a patient could potentially submit in person at the hospital's HIM department.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language parity**: Form-3 is a fully equivalent Spanish version with the same 52 fillable fields — genuine language access for Riverside's majority-Hispanic community.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare among ROI forms and signals awareness of interoperability standards.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure).
- **52 fillable fields**: Among the most technically complete fillable forms observed.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Patients are funneled through the same generic authorization form used for insurance companies and attorneys.
- **No right-of-access language**: The form never informs patients of their HIPAA right to access their own records or the associated protections (fee limits, 30-day timeline).
- **Centralized processing**: All requests route to Nashville, TN — no local submission address on the current form.
- **Grammar error persists**: "obtain a copy the information" (missing "of") appears across all form versions.

## Overall Assessment

Riverside Community Hospital delivers a technically competent but patient-generic records request experience. The fillable PDF, Spanish-language version, and multiple delivery options represent genuine strengths. However, the organization treats patient self-access as just another type of third-party release, missing an opportunity to provide a streamlined, patient-centered pathway. A patient can get their records through this process, but they receive no guidance tailored to their situation and may not understand their rights. The overall experience earns a **B** — solid technical execution held back by a one-size-fits-all approach to records access.

# The Valley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

The Valley Hospital is a nonprofit, independent community hospital in Paramus, NJ, operating under the Valley Health System umbrella alongside Valley Medical Group (VMG) and Valley Home Care. Four PDF authorization forms were found — two VMG versions (July 2023 and May 2023), one older hospital-specific form hosted on MRO Corp's site (last revised 2011), and one Valley Home Care form (April 2023). Critically, the hospital's medical records page now directs patients to an online records request tool with identity verification via driver's license photo, rather than linking to any downloadable PDF forms.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is the **online records request tool** accessible from the medical records page at `valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`. This represents a meaningful shift toward patient-centered digital access — the identity verification via driver's license photo suggests a workflow specifically designed for the patient themselves, distinct from third-party release scenarios.

The PDF forms, by contrast, are all **generic HIPAA authorization forms** designed for release of information to any recipient. None is a dedicated patient access form. The most current form (form-1, VMG, July 2023) accommodates patient self-access through instructions that say "If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF'" — functional but clearly an afterthought within a third-party disclosure framework. The four forms create a confusing landscape: a patient of The Valley Hospital proper might not realize the VMG form is what they need for ambulatory records, while a separate home care form exists for Valley Home Care patients. No guidance on the website explains which form applies to which entity.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the online records request tool is straightforward — the medical records page sits at a logical URL in the patient resources section. Finding the PDF forms, however, requires search engine assistance. The medical records page no longer links to any downloadable PDFs. The forms remain hosted at their original URLs on valleyhealth.com (and on mrocorp.com for the older hospital form) but are effectively orphaned. A patient who specifically wants a PDF form would need to search externally — not an unreasonable ask, but not ideal either.

## Form Document Quality

The best PDF form (form-1, VMG July 2023) is a well-structured 2-page document with a clear Section A/Section B organization and a full second page of step-by-step instructions with practical examples. The instructions are genuinely helpful — explaining how to designate self-access, offering example expiration events, and warning about unencrypted email risks. However, **none of the four forms has any fillable/interactive PDF fields** (all have `fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being born-digital documents with clean text layers, they are designed purely for print-and-fill workflow. The form offers five delivery methods — fax, paper copy, CD, unencrypted email, and encrypted email — a strong set of options. The encrypted email option is a positive differentiator.

The language is mixed: the instructions page uses plain language, but the sensitive information consent section is dense. The form's handling of sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance use, reproductive health) includes important NJ-specific protections but is complex enough to confuse lay readers. Approximately 20–25 fields must be completed, which is reasonable for a records authorization.

## Barriers

**Misleading "entire record" checkbox**: Checking "Entire medical record" on form-1 will *exclude* Behavioral Health Specialist and Substance Use Specialist records unless those boxes are also separately checked. This is the most significant red flag — a patient checking "entire record" would reasonably expect completeness.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "there may be a fee" based on page count but discloses no amounts. The older hospital form (form-3) explicitly states a $1/page fee for personal use, which may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access. Fees are processed through MRO Disclosure Management Solutions, a third-party vendor.

**No form submission instructions**: Form-1 tells patients what to fill out but never specifies where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email for submission. Only the revocation address is provided.

**No notarization or witness required** on the primary form (form-1), though the older hospital form (form-3) includes a witness line.

## Bright Spots

- **Online portal transition**: The org has moved its primary pathway to a digital records request tool, significantly improving access over PDF-only workflows.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: Offering encrypted email alongside standard options demonstrates privacy awareness.
- **Comprehensive instructions**: The full-page plain-language instruction sheet with practical examples is among the better guidance we've seen.
- **Five delivery methods**: Fax, paper, CD, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients meaningful choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

The Valley Hospital earns a **B grade** primarily because of its transition to an online records request portal, which places it ahead of organizations still relying solely on paper forms. The PDF forms themselves are adequate but generic — they serve third-party release as the primary use case and accommodate patient self-access as a secondary scenario. The absence of fillable fields on all four PDFs is a missed opportunity for born-digital documents. The misleading "entire record" exclusion and fee ambiguity are notable compliance concerns, though neither rises to the level of an active barrier to access. The organization's investment in an online portal signals a patient-centered direction, even as its legacy PDF forms lag behind.

# Texas Oncology — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Texas Oncology provides a single ROI form — an "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf). Both are 3-page fillable PDFs, structurally identical, revised 09/19/2024. They are available as direct downloads from a dedicated Medical Records page at texasoncology.com/medical-records. The page outlines a clear 3-step process: download the form, complete it, and submit by fax or mail.

No patient portal submission, online request wizard, or third-party vendor platform (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was found. The only request pathway is the downloadable PDF form submitted by fax or mail.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Texas Oncology does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party disclosure. The single form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering nine disclosure reasons — Treatment, Personal Use, Billing, Legal Purposes, Disability Determination, School, Employment, Health Oversight, and Other. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" and then navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios, including filling in both "I authorize the following to disclose" (naming Texas Oncology) and "Who can receive and use the health information?" (naming themselves). This is awkward when the requester and recipient are the same person.

Notably, page 2 of the form includes a legally accurate statement that "This form is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual," citing 45 CFR §§ 164.502(a)(1)(i) and 164.524. However, this critical information is buried in supplementary legal text — not surfaced on page 1 where a patient would see it before completing the 3-page form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible from footer navigation (approximately one click from the homepage). While older PDF URLs found via web search returned 404 errors due to a site migration to Sitecore Edge CDN, the live page links worked without issue. No bot blocking, login walls, or captchas were encountered. Overall retrieval difficulty: easy to moderate — the slight complication was dead legacy URLs, but the current page is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed fillable PDF with 95 interactive fields — a thoroughly digitized form designed for on-screen completion. The layout is clean and logical: patient demographics → reason for disclosure → authorizing party → recipient → delivery method → record types → time period → signature. Section headers in all caps provide clear visual hierarchy.

The form offers 16 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, radiology reports, pathology, etc.) plus "All Health Information" and "Other," giving patients meaningful granularity. Four sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, genetic information, HIV/AIDS) require separate initialing, consistent with HIPAA and Texas law.

The language is reasonably plain for a legal authorization form. The statement that treatment cannot be denied for refusing to sign is prominently placed at the top of page 1 — better positioning than many ROI forms. However, the fee language on page 2 contains a grammatical error ("There may charge a retrieval/processing fee") and fails to specify amounts or distinguish patient-access fees from third-party disclosure fees.

The 95 fillable fields lack semantic names in the PDF metadata (all field names are empty), which impairs accessibility for screen readers and assistive technology.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Barriers are low to moderate.** No notarization is required — only a patient signature. No in-person submission is required; fax and mail are both accepted. The authorization expiration is reasonable (valid until death, revocation, or optional specified date). Right to revoke is clearly stated. The form includes current reproductive health protections (45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)) with a dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page — demonstrating up-to-date compliance with 2024 federal rules.

The main barrier is the lack of electronic submission: despite the fillable PDF and email as a records *delivery* option, patients must still print, sign, and fax or mail the form. There is no e-signature, portal upload, or online submission pathway.

Fee disclosure is vague — "a retrieval/processing fee may be charged" without specifics. No response time commitment is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: A professionally translated Spanish version is offered as a parallel download — commendable for a Texas-based practice serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **Reproductive health protections**: The dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page is current with 2024 federal law.
- **Email delivery option**: Records can be delivered via email, providing a practical electronic access mechanism.
- **Treatment-not-conditioned**: Prominently positioned at the top of page 1.

## Overall Assessment

Texas Oncology provides a competent but generic records request experience. The form is well-built as a document — fillable, logically organized, bilingual, and legally current. However, it funnels patients through a third-party authorization process rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. The buried acknowledgment that the form "is not required" for patient self-access only underscores this mismatch. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience. The organization earns a **B** grade — solid document quality and accessibility, held back by the lack of a patient-centered access pathway.

# A.O. Fox Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

A.O. Fox Hospital is a community hospital in Oneonta, NY, part of the Bassett Healthcare Network. It does not maintain its own medical records request form; instead, patients are directed to a single, network-wide "Authorization for Medical Record Release" (form H-6653) shared across all five Bassett facilities. This is the sole form available and serves as the primary pathway for any patient — whether requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Access Pathway

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of medical record release, not a dedicated patient access request form. However, it does meaningfully accommodate patient self-access: Section 2 includes a "Self, address listed above" checkbox, Section 7 offers "Patient Request" as a purpose option, and Section 4 defaults to electronic delivery via the MyBassett Portal when no format is specified. These features ensure a patient can navigate the form for self-access without excessive confusion, but the form's framing as an "Authorization for Medical Record Release" — rooted in 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization concepts rather than § 164.524 Right of Access — means patients are signing an authorization they don't technically need, and must navigate sections (verbal communication authorization, expiration dates, redisclosure warnings) that are largely irrelevant to self-access.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the pathway level. There is no separate patient access form, no distinct web page for individual record requests, and no portal-based request wizard. The single PDF form serves all purposes.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**, though not via A.O. Fox Hospital directly. A search for Fox-specific forms returned nothing; searching for the parent system — Bassett Healthcare Network — immediately surfaced a direct PDF link on bassett.org. A patient who knows Fox is part of Bassett would locate this quickly. One who searches only for "A.O. Fox Hospital medical records" might need an extra step. No bot blocking, broken links, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-constructed, digital-first fillable PDF** — one of the strongest technical implementations in the study. Key characteristics:

- **Fillable fields**: 83 AcroForm interactive fields across just 2 pages, covering every checkbox, text input, and signature area. This is unusually thorough.
- **Layout**: 10 clearly numbered sections with bold headings provide logical flow and easy scanning.
- **Delivery options**: Seven methods offered (MyBassett Portal, USB, CD, Fax, US Mail, in-person pickup at two locations, Email with encrypted/unencrypted options). The portal-first default is a progressive design choice.
- **Record type selection**: 13 categories plus "Entire Medical Record" and an open-ended "Other" field, with date range controls.
- **Sensitive records**: An opt-out model (Section 6) lets patients exclude categories they don't want disclosed, rather than requiring explicit opt-in for each — a patient-protective default.

**Weaknesses** are minor but notable: two typos ("Frist" for "First", "DISCLOUSRE" for "DISCLOSURE"), internal Windows file paths exposed in the revision line (`d:\forms\hosp\.ofm`), and dense legalese in the rights section — particularly the HIV/AIDS redisclosure paragraph, which is a single four-line sentence. The form does not mention fees or response times.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. The form requires only a patient signature — no notarization, no witness, no in-person submission requirement. The no-conditioning statement is clearly articulated. The one-year date range default ("If left blank, information from the past (1) year will be provided") could inadvertently limit scope for patients seeking older records, but this is a scope default rather than a true barrier.

## Bright Spots

- **Portal-first default delivery** is rare and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **83 fillable fields** on a 2-page form represents exceptional digital-first design.
- **Seven delivery format options** including encrypted email with explicit risk acknowledgment.
- **Opt-out model for sensitive records** defaults toward completeness.
- **No-conditioning language** explicitly protects patient rights.

## Overall Assessment

A.O. Fox Hospital, through its parent Bassett Healthcare Network, provides a technically excellent form that is easy to find and free of major barriers. The form's primary limitation is structural: it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual right of access — through a generic authorization framework designed for third-party release. While the form accommodates patient self-access well, it does not center it. A dedicated patient access pathway or a clearly separated section for self-access requests would elevate this from a good form to an exemplary one. Grade: **B**.

# West Tennessee Healthcare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

West Tennessee Healthcare (Jackson, TN) is a government-owned regional health system that demonstrates an above-average approach to patient record access by maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** (form-3) separate from its third-party release authorization (form-2) and an older clinic-level release form (form-1). The organization also offers an online request portal via ScanSTAT and publishes Spanish-language versions of its key forms. However, the forms themselves are not fillable PDFs, and some legacy legal language undermines the patient-centered intent.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all linked from a clearly labeled medical records page at wth.org/request-medical-records/:

- **Form-3 (primary)**: "Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — explicitly subtitled "To be used when patient wants to access their own medical record or allow a personal representative to do so." This is the most relevant form for patient self-access. It offers five delivery methods: paper, fax, CD/DVD, portal, and email (encrypted or unencrypted). Two pages, ~3,300 characters.
- **Form-2**: "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" — a third-party release authorization. One page, similar structure but without the portal delivery option.
- **Form-1**: "Medical Release Authorization" — an older (2019) form specific to the West Tennessee Medical Group Clinics. Functions as a general release for discussing care with designated individuals.

Additionally, the medical records page links to a **ScanSTAT online request portal** for hospital records, providing a fully digital alternative pathway. Spanish versions of forms 2 and 3 are also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

West Tennessee Healthcare clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release — a practice that relatively few organizations follow. Form-3 uses "request" language (appropriate for HIPAA § 164.524) rather than "authorization" language, and includes a portal delivery shortcut ("If choosing portal, please proceed to signature line. No other action needed"). The medical records webpage provides context to help patients choose the correct form. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The layout is logical — flowing from identification to delivery method to record selection to legal terms to signature — but relies on underscored blank lines and an initials-based record type selection system (15 categories). The language is moderately accessible in the patient-facing sections but becomes denser in the five legal "I understand" statements. No section headers divide the form; the structure relies on spatial layout and field labels. At two pages, the length is proportionate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search returned direct PDF links, and the medical records page is clearly labeled and well-organized. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The page provides good context about when to use each form.

## Barriers and Concerns

Two compliance issues stand out on form-3:

1. **Liability waiver**: "The facility is hereby released from any liability and the undersigned will hold the facility harmless for complying with this request." Requiring patients to waive liability to exercise their Right of Access is problematic under HIPAA.
2. **90-day expiration on an access request**: This language was carried over from the authorization form and is conceptually inappropriate — a patient access request is a one-time action, not an ongoing authorization that needs to expire.

Additional minor concerns include the driver's license requirement for non-in-person requests, SSN collection (last 4 digits), no fee disclosure, and no explicit statement of patient rights or response timeframe. The form also omits the non-conditioning statement that appears on form-2.

## Bright Spots

- **Dedicated patient access form** with clear purpose statement
- **ScanSTAT online portal** as an alternative digital pathway
- **Spanish-language versions** of both key forms
- **Multiple delivery options** including portal and encrypted email with risk disclosure
- **Easy findability** from a well-organized medical records page

## Overall Assessment

West Tennessee Healthcare shows genuine patient-centered intent by distinguishing patient access from third-party release and offering multiple pathways including an online portal. The organization loses points for non-fillable PDFs, legacy legal language (liability waiver, expiration clause), and missing rights/fee information. The structural approach is strong, but the execution — particularly the form document quality and some compliance details — keeps this from being a top-tier example. Overall, a solid B-level performance that could reach A-level with fillable fields and cleaned-up legal language.

# Bath Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Bath Community Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Hot Springs, Virginia. The organization offers a single ROI form for medical records requests, hosted on its website. No patient portal, online request wizard, or alternative digital pathway was identified.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a one-page "Request of Information" PDF (`form-1.pdf`) branded under **Bath Community Physicians Group** rather than Bath Community Hospital itself. This branding mismatch is common among small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative infrastructure. The form is hosted on the hospital's website at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf` and linked from the Patient Resources → Forms page.

The form is a generic release-of-information authorization — it uses a "Send / Receive" and "To / From" structure designed primarily for inter-provider record transfers, not for patient self-access. A patient wanting their own records would need to adapt the form by marking "Send" and writing in their own name and address as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA individual access rights, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. A targeted web search surfaced the PDF directly, and the hospital's website links to it from a clearly labeled "Medical Records Request" section under Patient Resources. The URL path is descriptive. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. For a small critical access hospital, the form is reasonably discoverable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **scanned paper document** with an OCR text layer — not a digitally-created or fillable PDF. Despite metadata suggesting 21 fillable fields, the field names are empty and the form functions as a flat scan that must be printed and completed by hand. The OCR layer contains numerous errors ("ERNOTE," "LABffEST RESULTS," "IMAGINE REPORTS," "DISHCHARGE SUMMARY"), rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers and text-based search tools.

At one page with approximately 15 patient-completed fields, the form is appropriately brief. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → authorization direction → destination → reason → record type selection → signature block. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records consent paragraph is somewhat dense. No instructions are provided for how to complete or submit the form.

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access requests. This creates a real barrier — a patient must find someone to witness their signature before submitting. The form also requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, raising privacy concerns for a document that may be faxed.

No fees are mentioned. No response time commitment is stated. Submission instructions are absent; the header includes a fax number (540-962-7881), suggesting fax is an available submission method, but this is not explicitly stated. No in-person-only requirement is stated, so fax submission appears available.

## Notable Strengths

The form correctly separates consent for alcohol/drug abuse and psychiatric records into a dedicated checkbox — proper 42 CFR Part 2 practice that many organizations neglect. It also includes a checkbox for patients to request a copy of their signed authorization, a HIPAA requirement that many forms omit.

## Overall Assessment

Bath Community Hospital provides a minimally functional pathway for patients to request their records, but the experience is not patient-centered. The form was designed for provider-to-provider transfers and requires patients to adapt it for self-access. The scanned-image quality, OCR errors, witness requirement, and lack of submission instructions all create friction. While the form is findable and brief, it reflects an older, paper-first approach to health information management typical of small independent facilities. A patient could complete the process, but would receive little guidance and face an unnecessary witness barrier along the way.

# Erlanger Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga, TN provides three distinct ROI-related documents: a general system-wide "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form-1), a behavioral health–specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" (form-3). The existence of form-3 — a purpose-built patient access request form — is the key differentiator for this organization and the focus of this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Erlanger is one of the organizations that clearly distinguishes between a patient exercising their right of access and a third-party release authorization. Form-3 is titled "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" and opens with the option to "give me a copy of my health information" — framing the interaction as a patient right rather than an authorization for disclosure. This is structurally separate from form-1, which serves as the general-purpose ROI authorization covering any release direction (to self, third party, insurer, attorney, etc.). The existence of this dedicated pathway shows deliberate organizational awareness that patient access and third-party release are different use cases with different legal frameworks.

However, the dedicated form originates from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital (EWCH) and it is unclear from the form itself whether it applies system-wide. The general ROI form (form-1) does include a "_________myself" option in the "Release Information To" field, providing an alternate pathway through the broader form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. All three were surfaced through a single web search, with no login walls, bot blocking, or broken links. The main erlanger.org site hosts a Medical Records page under patient tools. Form-3's URL is under a "murphy" path that may be associated with a specific facility building, making it less discoverable via direct site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the primary patient access form, is a single-page, digitally authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The layout is clean and logical, flowing from patient identification through facility selection, date range, record type checkboxes, format preference, delivery method, and signature. The language is notably plain and patient-friendly, using first-person phrasing: "I would like," "I want these parts of my record." The form provides granular record selection with 18 options across hospital and office/clinic categories, giving patients meaningful control over scope.

Form-1 (the general ROI) is also digitally authored with a text layer but no fillable fields (2 pages, 14+ record type options). Form-2 (behavioral health) is an image-only scan — inaccessible to screen readers and impossible to fill electronically.

## Submission Methods

Form-3 does not clearly state how to submit the completed form. An "EWCH Use Only" section with "ID Verified" checkboxes implies in-person submission may be expected. However, the broader Erlanger system accepts fax submissions — form-2's instruction page provides a fax number for the HIM department, and form-1 includes fax as a contact/delivery option. Mail is also available. No online portal or email submission option exists for the forms themselves, though secure email is offered as a records *delivery* method.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness requirements exist. The primary patient access form (form-3) is completely silent on fees — patients have no idea if they will be charged. Form-1 mentions "charges may apply" for CD and paper copies but does not specify amounts. Form-3 notes a 30-day turnaround, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Both form-1 and form-3 request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary when combined with name, DOB, and medical record number. Form-1 bundles sensitive-category consent (substance abuse, HIV, mental health) with no opt-out mechanism, which may raise 42 CFR Part 2 concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release — a meaningful structural choice
- **Plain-language, first-person framing** that is unusually patient-friendly
- **Granular record type selection** (18 options across hospital and clinic settings)
- **Secure email as a delivery option** for receiving records
- **Single-page simplicity** for the patient access form

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any form — all require print-and-handwrite workflow
- **No fee disclosure** on the patient access form
- **Unclear submission process** for form-3 (implies in-person with ID verification)
- **No patient rights statement** on the dedicated access form
- **Behavioral health form (form-2)** is an image-only scan with production errors (placeholder text left in)

## Overall Assessment

Erlanger demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form with plain language and granular record selection. The organizational awareness that patient access differs from third-party release is commendable. However, the complete absence of fillable fields, unclear submission instructions, and lack of fee transparency prevent the experience from being truly streamlined. The overall pathway earns a **B** — solid design intent held back by technical and process execution gaps.

# Bayshore Medical Center — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Bayshore Medical Center, part of the Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) system, routes patients through the system-wide infrastructure for medical records requests. Six documents were retrieved during the search process, but only two are directly relevant for a Bayshore patient requesting their own records: the **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary English pathway) and the **CMR-003 authorization form** (form-6, a 2-page PDF covering all 11 HMH hospitals). A Spanish companion form (CMR-003S, form-3) mirrors the English PDF. Additional documents include an older Medical Group outpatient release form (form-1, dated 2018), two forms from sister facility Pascack Valley (forms 2 and 5), and a records amendment form (form-4).

The primary pathway for English-speaking patients is the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, linked from the HMH system-wide Medical Records page under "Request Records." Spanish-speaking patients are directed to the CMR-003S PDF download. Notably, the English PDF version of CMR-003 is **not linked** from the Medical Records page — it was found only through web search under an inconsistent URL path (medical-group/patient-forms rather than patients-visitors).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Bayshore does not offer a dedicated patient self-access PDF form. The CMR-003 PDF is a generic HIPAA authorization framed around third-party disclosure: "I authorize Hackensack Meridian Health to release information to: Organization/Recipient." A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name as the "recipient" and select "Personal use" from five purpose options — an awkward workaround. The online portal (Swellbox/Datavant) likely provides a more patient-centric experience as the primary pathway, but the PDF form does not distinguish between individual access and third-party release.

Interestingly, Pascack Valley Medical Center (an HMH sister facility) offers a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-5) with patient-first language and a "Myself" default recipient option. This demonstrates that the HMH system has the concept of a dedicated patient-access form but has not standardized it across all facilities.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the relevant forms required significant effort. The search involved web searches, site-specific navigation, URL pattern guessing, and cross-facility comparison. The Bayshore Medical Center sub-page links to the HMH Medical Records page (2–3 clicks), which prominently features the Swellbox portal but buries the PDF forms. The English CMR-003 was located via web search under the Medical Group directory — a misleading location for a hospital-level form. Retrieval difficulty: **hard**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary PDF form (CMR-003, form-6) is a born-digital 2-page document with a clean text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print and hand-write all entries. This is particularly notable given that HMH's own amendment form (form-4) has 54 fillable fields — proving the organization has the capability but did not apply it to the ROI form. The layout is logically structured with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient info → recipient → location → records → purpose → sensitive-record consent → signature → delivery format. Record type granularity is good (11 categories) and delivery format options are comprehensive (paper, encrypted USB/CD, fax, secured email).

Language is a mix of plain and legal. Core instructions are clear, but the minor consent section and legal disclosures use dense, nested phrasing. The form lacks explicit submission instructions — while the contact directory on page 2 lists HIM phone and fax numbers for each campus, the form never tells patients *how* to submit the completed authorization. The fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee… Please ask."

## Barriers and Bright Spots

No notarization, in-person submission, or witness requirements exist. Fax submission is available (Bayshore HIM fax: 732-888-7332), providing an adequate electronic pathway. The vague fee disclosure and absent submission instructions are minor barriers.

The standout bright spot is the **EHI Export option** — an explicit offer to provide records in a machine-readable format uploadable to another EHR. This is exceptionally rare on ROI forms and directly supports 21st Century Cures Act interoperability goals (despite the typo "Electric" instead of "Electronic" Health Record). The Spanish companion form, comprehensive contact directory, and granular sensitive-record consent are additional strengths.

## Overall Assessment

Bayshore Medical Center, via HMH, provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox/Datavant portal offers a digital-first primary pathway, and the PDF form — while non-fillable and oriented toward third-party release — includes progressive features like EHI Export and multilingual availability. The main weaknesses are the difficult findability of the English PDF, the generic authorization framing that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, and the lack of fillable fields on a form that could easily support them. Grade: **B**.

# Medical City Dallas Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Medical City Dallas Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare's Medical City Healthcare division, provides patients with a single system-wide authorization form for requesting health records. The form is available in both English and Spanish as fillable PDFs linked from the hospital's medical records webpage. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients requesting their own records use the same generic HIPAA authorization form designed for all release-of-information scenarios, including third-party disclosures.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were retrieved, both hosted on HCA's digital asset management platform (`hcadam.com`):

- **Form 1** (English): HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21 — "Authorization for Release of PHI (Protected Health Information)." A 1-page fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields.
- **Form 2** (Spanish): HCA-840-00434-S — Direct Spanish translation of Form 1, with identical structure and 52 fillable fields.

Both forms are general-purpose release authorizations. The purpose-of-disclosure field offers "At the request of the individual" as one option alongside "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form does not distinguish between patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) and third-party authorization. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission wizard.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required navigating the hospital website to the medical records page (`/locations/medical-city-dallas-hospital/for-patients/medical-records`). Direct web searches returned stale 404 URLs from a previous hosting location (`medicalcityhealthcare.com/util/forms/`), with no redirects in place. Once on the correct page, the forms are clearly labeled and directly downloadable. No bot blocking or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed, born-digital PDF — not a scan. All 52 fields are interactive and fillable on-screen, eliminating the need for handwriting. The single-page format is efficient but extremely dense: patient demographics, recipient information, four delivery options (paper, electronic media, encrypted email, unencrypted email), 16+ record-type checkboxes, a six-point disclosure statement, psychotherapy notes handling, marketing/sale of PHI questions, and a signature block are all compressed into one page. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — functional for most adults but potentially challenging for low-literacy readers.

The form provides clear section headers (A, B, C) and logically groups related fields. Instructions are implicit in the form structure rather than stated separately. The consent statements correctly cover voluntary authorization, revocation rights, and non-conditioning of treatment — standard HIPAA requirements. The form mentions a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying an amount.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked "(optional)." While optional, collecting SSN on an ROI form is unnecessary for patient identification and creates a data exposure risk.
- **Centralized processing**: All requests go to HCA headquarters in Nashville (PO Box 290789), not to the local hospital. A patient expecting to deal with Medical City Dallas directly may find this confusing.
- **Fax restriction**: Fax delivery is limited to "Physician Office / Medical facility," which could restrict a patient's ability to receive records via fax at a non-medical location.
- **No online submission**: The form must be printed, signed, and mailed or faxed to Nashville. There is no portal-based or email submission option. However, fax submission is available (844-481-0298), meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language version**: A fully translated Spanish form with identical structure and fillable fields, linked with Spanish-language text from the same page — a meaningful accessibility feature for Dallas's large Spanish-speaking population.
- **USCDI release option**: The form includes a forward-looking option for USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release requests, acknowledging modern health data exchange standards. This is rare among ROI forms.
- **52 fillable fields**: Comprehensive digital interactivity means the entire form can be completed on-screen before printing for signature.
- **Four delivery format options**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients genuine choice.

## Overall Assessment

Medical City Dallas Hospital, via its parent HCA Healthcare, provides a technically competent ROI form that is fillable, multilingual, and reasonably well-organized. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — there is no dedicated patient access pathway. The form is a generic authorization that serves all purposes. Findability is hampered by broken legacy URLs, and the centralized Nashville processing model may confuse local patients. The form's document quality is solid (fillable, clear sections, multiple delivery options), but the lack of a patient-centric access pathway and the optional SSN field are notable shortcomings. The organization earns a mid-range assessment: technically adequate with meaningful strengths in multilingual access and digital form quality, but falling short on patient-centeredness and access pathway design.

# Merit Health Central — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Merit Health Central is a for-profit community hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, part of Community Health Systems (CHS) operating under the Merit Health brand. The facility uses system-standardized forms for records requests and also offers an online portal alternative via Swellbox. Two PDF forms were retrieved — English (HIM-1406) and Spanish (HIM-1406S) versions of the same document — both linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page.

## Available Pathways & Primary Form

The primary form (form-1.pdf, HIM-1406) is titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** — notably not "Authorization for Release" or similar third-party-oriented language. The form allows patients to request records for themselves, a personal representative, or a third party, with "Myself" listed as the first recipient option. A Spanish translation (form-2.pdf, HIM-1406S) with identical structure and 66 fillable fields is provided alongside. The website also offers an online request process via Swellbox (swellbox.com/merit-health-jackson-wizard.html), giving patients a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Merit Health Central does not maintain separate forms for patient self-access vs. third-party release — both use cases are served by the same HIM-1406 form. However, the form is clearly designed with patient self-access as the primary use case: the title, structure, and "Myself" first-option framing all signal a patient-access orientation. The form explicitly distinguishes recipients (self, personal representative, third party) with labeled options. This is a meaningful step above the generic third-party authorization model, even though a truly separate patient access pathway does not exist.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/request-medical-records`. The page sits under "Patients & Visitors" navigation with clearly labeled English and Spanish download links. An FAQ section addresses common questions about authorization, charges, and who can request records — providing useful context before the patient downloads anything. No bot-blocking or browser fallback issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a born-digital, single-page interactive PDF with 66 fillable fields — an exceptionally high count that means virtually every input area is digitally completable. The layout follows a logical seven-section flow: patient information, facility identification, record type selection (12 checkbox categories), sensitive information disclosure (5 categories with individual opt-in checkboxes), delivery method selection, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and direct, with clear section headers framed as patient-facing questions. The one-page format is impressively concise given the coverage.

The form offers five delivery methods: paper, email (with risk acknowledgment), removable media (DVD/USB/CD-ROM with password protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media with password protection is an unusually thoughtful option. The HIPAA acknowledgment in the footer — "This Healthcare Facility recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information" — explicitly references patient rights, though it could be more prominent.

## Barriers & Concerns

No major barriers were identified. No notarization is required, there is no in-person-only submission requirement, and the form avoids consent bundling. However, three ambiguities merit attention: (1) fee disclosure is vague — "There may be charges" with no amounts, schedules, or reference to HIPAA cost-based limits; (2) the form itself does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization (no fax number, email, or mailing address on the form); and (3) a witness signature field is present without explanation of when a witness is required, which may confuse patients completing the form remotely.

## Notable Strengths

The Spanish translation is a genuine bright spot — a fully functional, equally prominent parallel form rather than an afterthought. The Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital alternative for patients who prefer not to deal with PDF workflows. The patient-first titling and structure, comprehensive delivery options, and high fillable field count collectively demonstrate above-average attention to patient access needs. The system-standardized form (revised six times since 2018) suggests ongoing maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Merit Health Central provides a well-above-average patient records request experience. The combination of a patient-focused PDF form, Spanish translation, and online Swellbox portal covers multiple access modalities. The form's digital-first design, logical layout, and comprehensive options serve patients well. Minor shortcomings — vague fee language, missing submission instructions on the form itself, witness field ambiguity — prevent a top-tier rating but do not materially impede patient access. This is a solid B-level performance.

# Emory University Hospital — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Emory University Hospital, part of the Emory Healthcare system, offers four documents on its medical records page: a current English ROI authorization form (form-1, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), a legacy 4-page ROI package (form-2, ~September 2022), a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), and a Request for Amendment form (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting records is form-1, the current English authorization. Emory also provides a Swellbox/Datavant online records request wizard as an alternative digital pathway.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Emory does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release authorization. The primary form is a generic "Authorization for the Release of Protected Health Information" used for all release scenarios — patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties all use the same document. However, the form does include "At my request" as a named purpose option, and its delivery methods include MyChart and EHI Export, signaling awareness that patients are a key audience. A patient requesting their own records must fill themselves in as the recipient, navigating a form framework designed around the third-party release paradigm. The Swellbox portal offers a somewhat more guided digital alternative, but the overall process does not clearly distinguish HIPAA Right of Access requests from general authorization-based releases.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A targeted web search for Emory Healthcare medical records forms surfaced the PDF URL directly, and the medical records page at `emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records` is well-organized with clear links to all relevant documents — English and Spanish authorization forms, fee sheets, e-delivery instructions, amendment form, and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed. The descriptive filename convention (`english-authorization-form-fillable-revised-11-2025.pdf`) is a small but meaningful usability detail. One minor issue: the URL path includes a `/wr/` segment (likely referencing the Warner Robins facility), which could confuse patients at other Emory locations.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely fillable 2-page PDF with approximately 100 interactive fields (checkboxes and text inputs), though the PDF's AES-256 encryption caused metadata tools to report zero fillable fields. The form is organized into numbered sections covering facility selection (18+ Emory Healthcare locations), recipient and delivery information, record type specification (17+ granular checkboxes with date fields), and purpose. The layout is clean and logical. Language is a mix of clear structural labels and moderately dense legal text on page 2 (revocation rights, re-disclosure warnings, sensitive information waiver). The form is not tagged for screen reader accessibility.

A notable strength is the range of delivery options: paper, CD, USB drive, MyChart, mail, pick-up, e-delivery website, email, and — remarkably — **EHI Export**, a forward-thinking option that very few organizations surface on their authorization forms. The Spanish-language version (form-3) mirrors the English structure, though it has character encoding issues (accented characters rendering as digits) and incomplete translation of institutional terms.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. No in-person submission requirement exists — patients can fax or use the Swellbox portal. The primary form does not disclose fees directly; a separate fee sheet ($6.50 flat for electronic delivery, $0.07/page for paper) is available on the medical records page. The legacy form-2 required a separate fee acknowledgment signature, but the current form-1 does not. The form does include a blanket waiver for sensitive information (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health) that does not allow patients to opt out of releasing specific sensitive categories — a common but patient-unfriendly approach.

## Overall Assessment

Emory Healthcare provides a competent, well-organized records request process with several standout features — particularly the EHI Export delivery option, the Spanish-language form, and the Swellbox online portal. The forms are easy to find, fillable, and recently updated. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must use the same generic authorization form as third-party requesters, without clear guidance on how to request their own records specifically. The form accommodates patient requests but was not designed around them as a first-class use case. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and well-maintained, but not yet patient-centered in its design philosophy.

# Penobscot Community Health Care — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Bangor, Maine. Two PDF forms were found, but they are identical documents hosted at different WordPress upload paths (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf share the same text, revision date, and form code MRC001). The organization's primary records request pathway is a third-party Datavant/Swellbox online portal, linked from the Health Information Management page. The PDF authorization form exists on the server but is not linked from any patient-facing page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

PCHC does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. The sole PDF form is titled "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" and covers both disclosing records TO a third party and obtaining records FROM a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the same form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties — including naming themselves as the recipient and navigating redisclosure warnings that don't apply to self-access. The purpose checkbox "At my request" is available but does not clearly distinguish individual access rights from authorized third-party release.

The Datavant/Swellbox portal (https://www.swellbox.com/pchc-wizard.html) is the pathway the organization actively directs patients toward from its website. While this provides a digital alternative, the PDF form — the only org-created document available for evaluation — remains a generic HIPAA authorization with no patient access specialization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted Google search (`filetype:pdf` query); it was **not discoverable** through normal website navigation. The HIM page (https://pchc.com/healthinformation/) links to the Datavant portal and a Privacy Practices Booklet, but not the authorization form PDF. Two identical copies at different URLs (`/2024/03/` and `/2021/11/` paths) create version-control confusion. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. Difficulty: moderate — the portal is findable from the website, but the PDF form is effectively hidden.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive fields) across 2 pages. Patients must print it, handwrite all entries, and submit physically. Despite the non-fillable format, the document itself is well-structured with clear, labeled sections progressing logically: patient identification → authorization direction → recipient details → delivery method → record types → sensitive information → purpose → duration → rights acknowledgments → signature. Approximately 18 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology. Core instructions ("To DISCLOSE my health information below TO:") are clear with helpful capitalization for emphasis, but several sections use dense legal prose. The "continuing communications" clause and opt-out-by-striking mechanisms are particularly confusing — patients must physically strike out text to limit scope, and failure to do so defaults to the broadest possible authorization, including ongoing disclosure of future encounters.

Record type granularity is good, offering seven specific categories plus an open-ended option, with date-range filtering. Four delivery methods are available: mail (defaulting to CD), fax, email via secure portal, and verbal communication.

## Barriers and Compliance

No fees are disclosed — neither excessive charges nor explicit statements of no-fee patient access. No notarization or witness is required. The form does not specify submission instructions, though PCHC's fax number (207-990-1248), mailing address, and email (PCHCMR@pchc.com) are provided in the header, implying fax and mail submission are available.

Compliance elements are generally sound: oral revocation is permitted, the non-conditioning statement is present, 42 CFR Part 2 redisclosure notice is properly included, and sensitive information categories require affirmative opt-in. However, the form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or reference the patient's right of access. The office-use section includes an unusual and commendable accountability checkbox requiring staff to flag partial or incomplete disclosures.

## Bright Spots

- **Secure email delivery** via PCHC's portal (records sent as PDFs accessible through a secure messaging system)
- **Oral revocation** permitted — more accessible than written-only requirements
- **Partial disclosure transparency** — internal checkbox requiring notification when records provided are incomplete
- **Datavant/Swellbox portal** provides an alternative digital pathway beyond the paper form

## Red Flags

- **PDF form is unlinkable from the website** — HIM page directs exclusively to Datavant, making the org's own form effectively hidden
- **Opt-out-by-striking defaults** to broadest possible authorization for continuing communications and third-party-received records
- **CD as default mail delivery** medium — outdated and likely unusable for many patients

## Overall Assessment

PCHC provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The organization deserves credit for offering a Datavant portal as a digital pathway and for several thoughtful compliance provisions. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access form, the non-fillable PDF, the hidden form URL, and the confusing opt-out defaults limit patient-centeredness. A patient navigating PCHC's website would be funneled to the Datavant portal — a workable option — but would struggle to find or use the organization's own authorization form independently.

# UAB Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UAB Hospital (UAB Medicine), a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, provides one of the clearer patient record request experiences encountered in this study. The organization maintains a dedicated medical records request page that explicitly separates patient self-access from third-party release, offering distinct downloadable PDF forms for each pathway. Three forms were retrieved: a patient self-access form (form-1), a Callahan Eye Hospital variant (form-2), and a third-party authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

UAB Medicine stands out by offering a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-1, "Patient Request for Own Medical Records") that is clearly differentiated from its third-party authorization form (form-3). The patient access form opens with an explicit rights-affirming statement: *"UAB Medicine recognizes a patient's right to access their own protected health information."* The medical records request page at `uabmedicine.org/pay-your-bill/medical-records-request/` routes patients to the correct form based on their need — self-access versus third-party disclosure — with separate download links. This is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the UAB Medicine website clearly organizes its medical records page. The patient access form has a descriptive URL and filename (`Patient-Request-own-medical-records.pdf`), making it identifiable even in search results. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Quality: The Primary Patient Access Form (Form-1)

Form-1 is a 2-page fillable PDF with **51 interactive form fields**, clean text extraction, and a logical layout. The form is structured into clear sections: patient demographics, recipient designation, sensitive records opt-in, date range, record package selection, delivery method, and signature. The language is generally plain and direct, though the tiered package system requires some cognitive effort to parse.

A standout feature is the **five-tier record package system**, offering graduated levels of detail from key clinical notes through the entire medical record. This gives patients meaningful control over scope rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice. Additionally, nine individual record-type checkboxes allow specific requests (operative reports, billing records, medication list, radiology images, etc.).

**Delivery options** are comprehensive: paper mail, in-person pickup, fax, CD, and email. Electronic delivery includes a clear notice about encryption and privacy. For form submission, patients can return the completed form by mail or **fax (205-930-6721)**, providing an adequate electronic submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no notarization or witness requirements. No in-person submission is required. There are no excessive procedural hurdles — a patient signs once and does not need to initial multiple clauses (unlike form-2's three-initial requirement). However, **fees are not mentioned at all** — neither confirming free patient access nor disclosing a fee schedule. This silence creates ambiguity for patients who may reasonably want to know costs upfront. Similarly, **no turnaround time** is stated.

One ambiguity warrants mention: the form asks patients whether to include psychiatric/substance use records (opt-in checkbox on page 1) but then includes blanket authorization language covering those same records in the signature block on page 2, creating a potential contradiction.

## Contextual Notes on Other Forms

Form-2 (Callahan Eye Hospital variant) serves the same self-access function but is notably inferior: it has **zero fillable fields**, requires print-and-handwrite completion, and is 3 pages despite offering less content (2 record packages versus 5). Its title conflates "Patient Access" with "Authorization for Use or Disclosure," and it omits the rights-affirming opening statement present in form-1. It also contains a pagination error ("Page 3/2"). However, the high-watermark principle means UAB is assessed based on form-1, not this weaker variant.

Form-3 is correctly scoped as a third-party authorization and is appropriately separate from the patient access pathway. Its text layer is completely garbled due to CID font encoding issues, creating accessibility barriers, but this does not affect the patient self-access assessment.

## Overall Assessment

UAB Hospital delivers an above-average patient record request experience. The dedicated patient self-access form with rights-affirming language, fillable fields, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options — combined with a well-organized website that clearly separates patient access from third-party release — places this organization among the better performers. The primary gaps are the absence of fee disclosure and turnaround time information. The form is not cutting-edge (no online portal or digital submission), but the fillable PDF with fax submission represents a solid, accessible workflow.

# Boulder Medical Center — Organization Synthesis

## Available Pathways

Boulder Medical Center (BMC) presents patients with three record-request pathways, clearly laid out on their [Medical Records department page](https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/departments/medical-records/): (1) a Swellbox online portal for records created before September 9, 2024; (2) the MyChart "Sharing Hub" for records after that date; and (3) a downloadable PDF authorization form. The PDF form (`form-1.pdf`) was the only traditional document available for download and is the focus of this evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

BMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single PDF form — titled "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Patient Information" — is a generic ROI authorization designed to handle bidirectional record transfers between entities. While the phrase "I am requesting my records" appears, the form's structure treats the patient as a routing intermediary rather than the information recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no language explaining patient-specific rights beyond the standard no-conditioning clause. The online portals (Swellbox and MyChart) may provide a more patient-centric experience, but neither was evaluated as a downloadable form document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search led directly to the Medical Records page, where the PDF is clearly linked under "Option 2." No bot-blocking, JavaScript rendering, or deep navigation was required. The page helpfully contextualizes the PDF as one of three options, giving patients a clear choice. This is a strong findability result.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a single-page, digitally-created document — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print and handwrite. The layout follows a logical flow (demographics → delivery method → record types → entity information → authorization → signatures), but the authorization section is a dense block of nine "I understand" statements with no visual separation. The form includes some genuinely helpful plain-language disclosures ("once this information is disclosed by BMC, it will no longer be protected by BMC"), though the dual-direction design ("from the Entity... to be mailed to ___ at BMC" vs. "to be sent to Entity listed below") is confusing for a patient requesting their own records for personal use. Record type options are limited to five categories with no "all records" checkbox.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form states a 10-business-day processing time, well within HIPAA's 30-day window. It correctly includes a no-conditioning clause and a 180-day expiration. However, the fee disclosure is vague ("there may be a cost to copy the records") with no schedule or estimate. Most concerning is the email restriction: "Due to HIPAA regulations regarding security of electronic transmissions, we cannot email records to anyone but your personal email." This mischaracterizes HIPAA, which explicitly grants patients the right to direct records to a third party. The designated agent language is also narrowly scoped, covering only incapacitated patients rather than parents of minors or POA holders. Submission can be done by fax (303-449-9380) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple pathways**: The website clearly presents three options (Swellbox, MyChart, PDF), giving patients choices based on their record dates and preferences.
- **Single-page conciseness**: The form avoids the multi-page burden common at other organizations.
- **Plain-language disclosures**: Several authorization statements are unusually clear and honest.
- **Easy findability**: The form is prominently linked from a well-organized Medical Records page.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** despite being a digitally-created PDF — a missed opportunity.
- **No patient access differentiation**: The form treats all requests identically regardless of who is requesting and why.
- **Misleading HIPAA email restriction**: Incorrectly frames a policy choice as a legal requirement.
- **Stale form**: Revision date January 2019, uploaded November 2020, but a major system transition occurred in September 2024.

## Overall Assessment

Boulder Medical Center earns credit for making its form easy to find and for offering multiple request pathways including online portals. However, the PDF form itself is a generic, non-fillable ROI authorization that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The misleading email restriction and vague fee disclosure are compliance concerns. A patient can complete the process via fax or mail submission without visiting in person, which meets the baseline, but the lack of fillable fields and the form's dual-direction confusion reduce usability. The organization is adequate but not patient-centered in its PDF-based pathway.

# Synthesis: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center

## Forms and Pathways

OSU Wexner Medical Center publishes two PDF forms on its [Medical Records page](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records), both titled "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (form ID MC040184, revised 11/2019). Form-1 is a single-page image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields — essentially a digitized paper artifact. Form-2 is a two-page digitally authored PDF that bundles numbered instructions (page 1) with the same authorization form (page 2). Form-2 has a full text layer and 25 embedded fonts but, despite being created in Adobe Acrobat Pro, still has zero fillable fields. Both forms use the same layout and legal text. Form-2 is clearly the better document and serves as the basis for this assessment.

The organization does not appear to offer a patient portal-based records request, an online submission wizard (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), or any other digital request pathway. Submission instructions list three physical mailing addresses and phone numbers for the Medical Information Management offices. No fax number or email address is listed for submitting the completed form. The form does accept eSignatures ("e.g., Adobe") with a date and time stamp, which opens the possibility that a patient could fill the form digitally using annotation tools and email or fax it — but no such submission channel is explicitly provided on the form itself.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

OSU Wexner does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same "Authorization to Release Medical Information" form is used whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney, insurer, or other third party is requesting them. The form's "Release Information To" section uses a sender-recipient model without any acknowledgment that a patient requesting their own records has distinct rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). There is no mention of the Right of Access anywhere on either form. Patients must complete the same "Purpose of Disclosure" field (with no guidance that they are not legally required to state a purpose for their own records), select facilities, and navigate the same legal text as any third-party requester.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned direct download links on the first attempt, and the forms are clearly linked from the organization's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor friction is the presence of two versions of the same form without guidance on which to use — a patient might download the image-only scan (form-1) and have a worse experience.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2's instructions page is a genuine bright spot: seven numbered items correspond to form sections, with practical guidance like "If uncertain about the location, select all box locations." The form itself offers granular record-type checkboxes (11 categories including Emergency Dept, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, Radiology, Pathology, etc.), multi-facility selection across 8 OSU locations, and reasonable purpose-of-disclosure options. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the form page is quite dense — it packs all fields, checkboxes, four paragraphs of legal text, signature lines, and three submission address blocks onto a single page, resulting in small font sizes and cramped spacing. The language mixes accessible instructions with HIPAA-derived terms ("designated record set," "re-disclosed by the recipient") that may confuse patients. Critically, despite being authored in Acrobat Pro, the form has no fillable fields — patients must print and handwrite.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is fee opacity. The form states "a fee may be charged" and directs all billing questions to CIOX Health (1-800-367-1500), a third-party ROI vendor, without any fee schedule or distinction between patient-access and third-party fees. For patient self-access, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts; the lack of transparency here raises concerns. The instructions require "all sections must be completed in their entirety," which means patients must state a purpose — not required by HIPAA for individual access. No notarization is required, and the witness signature is optional, which is positive. The form has not been updated since November 2019, predating the 2021 information blocking rules and 2024 42 CFR Part 2 revisions.

## Bright Spots

- Dedicated, well-structured instructions page with numbered items
- Granular record-type selection (11 categories)
- Multi-facility selection with practical guidance for uncertain patients
- eSignature acceptance (Adobe)
- Correct substance use disorder and psychotherapy notes disclosures

## Overall Assessment

OSU Wexner Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably organized ROI form with useful instructions, but falls short on digital accessibility (no fillable fields, no electronic submission channel), patient-centeredness (no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release), and fee transparency. The process is fundamentally a print-and-mail paper workflow dressed in a PDF wrapper.

# Lincoln Hospital (Davenport, WA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lincoln Hospital, a small government-owned critical access hospital in rural eastern Washington, publishes two ROI forms on its Health Records page: a **clinics version** (form-1.pdf) for records held at North Basin Medical Clinics and a **hospital version** (form-2.pdf) for hospital records. Both are titled "Authorization for Release of Health Care Information and Records" and share nearly identical structure and legal boilerplate. The forms are reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Health Records), making them reasonably easy to find.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information — the page 1 structure asks patients to specify a recipient for records, with fields for the recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. Page 2 of each form includes an "ACCESS REQUEST" section that acknowledges the patient's right to inspect and obtain copies of their own records, making the forms technically dual-purpose. However, a patient requesting their own records receives no clear guidance on how to fill out the third-party-oriented page 1 — should they list themselves as the recipient? The form doesn't say. The "At the request of the Patient" purpose checkbox and "Given to Patient" delivery option exist but are not prominently featured as a distinct pathway.

## Form Document Quality

The hospital form (form-2.pdf) is the technically superior document: it has a full text layer (7,364 characters extractable), making it screen-reader accessible and searchable. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. The clinics form (form-1.pdf) is worse: a scanned image of a paper document with no extractable text whatsoever, rendering it completely inaccessible to assistive technology.

Both forms are 2 pages and reasonably organized. Page 1 uses labeled sections (Types of Information, Purpose, Revocation, Re-Disclosure, No Conditions, Time Frame, Consent of Minor) with clear visual hierarchy. The language mixes plain English with necessary legal terminology; sections like the "No Conditions" statement are clear, while the sensitive-information preamble is dense legalese. The hospital form's "OFFICE USE" section appears near patient-facing fields without clear labeling, potentially confusing patients about what they need to fill out.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were found through web search and confirmed on the hospital website. The Health Records page returned a 403 error to automated fetch tools (likely bot blocking), requiring browser access, but loaded normally in a standard browser. One alternate URL for the clinics form returned HTTP 400, suggesting stale links. Overall findability was good — a patient navigating the website would locate these forms without difficulty.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant concern is the **fee structure**. The clinics form cites Washington's WAC 246-08-400 fee schedule ($26.00 search/base fee, $1.17/page for first 30 pages, $0.88/page thereafter plus tax) — fees designed for third-party record duplication that likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests. Worse, this fee schedule references dates of September 2017 through June 2019, making it nearly seven years expired. The hospital form takes a different approach: its fee field reads "$______ per page" with the amount left blank — unhelpful for patients trying to anticipate costs.

The clinics form requires patients to attach a copy of photo identification, which goes beyond HIPAA requirements and creates an additional burden. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both forms correctly state a 30-day response time (60 days for off-site records) with one possible 30-day extension, aligning with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

The clinics form offers electronic delivery options — "MyChart Secure Patient Portal, CD, USB Flash Drive (provided by patient)" — a notably progressive feature for a small rural critical access hospital. The "Most recent two (2) years" date range shortcut with specific clinical examples (colonoscopy, mammogram, DEXA, diabetic exams) is patient-friendly. Both forms include an explicit "No Conditions" statement and detailed minor consent provisions aligned with Washington State law.

## Overall Assessment

Lincoln Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and include some thoughtful patient-facing features (electronic delivery options, clinical shortcuts), but fundamental issues undermine the experience: no fillable fields on either form, a generic third-party authorization structure that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, potentially excessive fees, and one form that is an image-only scan. The organization deserves credit for acknowledging patient access rights on page 2 of each form but falls short of providing a clear, patient-centric access pathway.

# Synthesis: Essentia Health-Fosston

## Overview

Essentia Health-Fosston is a critical access hospital in Fosston, MN, part of the regional nonprofit Essentia Health system. The facility does not maintain its own medical records forms; it uses system-wide Essentia Health documents for all records-related processes. Four documents were retrieved, but only one — the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (form-1, EH10843 12/25) — is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records. The other three documents serve adjacent purposes: MyChart portal enrollment (form-2), MyChart proxy access delegation (form-3), and verbal information-sharing authorization (form-4).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Essentia Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting records on behalf of someone else. Form-1 is a general-purpose authorization with "From" and "To" fields designed for transferring records between entities. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both fields — putting themselves as the recipient — and check "Personal use" as the reason. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and no tailored instructions for self-access requests. That said, Essentia Health does offer meaningful alternatives: the medical records page directs patients to **MyChart** as the primary access pathway and provides a **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** as a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link, and Essentia Health's medical records page (`essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`) is well-organized with clearly labeled download links. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was required. The URL structure is clean and descriptive. All forms are hosted on the main Essentia Health domain (except the MyChart-related forms on `essentiamychart.org`).

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page**, digitally-designed PDF with a complete text layer — impressively compact for the scope it covers. The layout follows a logical flow from patient demographics through release details, record type selection, delivery method, and legal notices. The form offers strong record type granularity with 18+ individual checkboxes plus an "All Routine Records" shortcut, and appropriately separates behavioral health and substance use disorder records with distinct opt-in/opt-out controls.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally composed. All data entry uses blank underscores, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a consistent pattern across all four Essentia Health forms and appears to be a deliberate system-wide design choice rather than a per-form oversight. The delivery method options are a bright spot: patients can receive records via MyChart, email, fax, or mail (paper or disc).

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unusual barriers — no notarization, no witness requirement (except for mark-based signatures), no in-person-only submission. Submission is available via email, fax, or mail. Fee language is vague: "I may be required to pay a fee for retrieval and photocopying of records," citing state statutes rather than HIPAA cost-based fee limits, with no specific amounts disclosed. The form properly includes anti-conditioning language, revocation rights, psychotherapy note protections, and 42 CFR Part 2 SUD protections. One notable issue: the MyChart enrollment forms (form-2, form-3) collect partial SSN, which is unnecessary for portal access and creates data minimization concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** provides a fully digital alternative pathway
- **Single-page form** — remarkably compact for comprehensive ROI coverage
- **Electronic delivery options** including email and MyChart — not just fax/mail
- **Multi-state legal compliance** across MN, WI, and ND
- **Recently revised** (December 2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Well-organized medical records page** with clear navigation and multiple pathway options

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization
- **Zero fillable fields** across all four system forms — entirely print-and-handwrite
- **Vague fee disclosure** with no specific amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee reference
- **Form-3 (MyChart proxy)** published as a proof copy with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers
- **Behavioral health opt-out vs. SUD opt-in** inconsistency may confuse patients

## Overall Assessment

Essentia Health-Fosston earns a **B grade**. The organization benefits from its parent system's well-organized web presence, a compact and recently-updated authorization form, and the availability of a digital request portal. The main limitations are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients must use a generic third-party authorization form) and the absence of fillable fields on any PDF form. The Swellbox portal partially compensates for the PDF's technical shortcomings, and the multiple electronic submission and delivery options keep the process accessible. A patient can successfully request their records without visiting the facility, but the process isn't designed around them.

# Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital is a community hospital in Fairfield, Ohio, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system. Medical records requests are managed centrally through the parent system's website at mercy.com, which provides a dedicated medical records request page covering all Mercy Health facilities. The hospital is listed as a checkbox option on the Cincinnati-region authorization form, with a dedicated fax number (513-599-4491).

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were downloaded. **Form-1** is an older Cincinnati-region "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (MHP 0786 Rev 1/19) with a full text layer and 5,192 characters of extractable text. **Form-2** is a newer system-wide version of the same form (printed 2024-01-17), but it is an image-only scan with only 46 characters of metadata — a significant regression in digital accessibility. Form-2 is the version currently linked from the medical records page; form-1's URL still works but is no longer prominently linked.

Beyond PDF forms, Mercy Health offers **MyChart** (patient portal) and an **online eRequest system** through Ciox/Datavant (Swellbox) at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html, providing genuinely electronic alternatives. A **Spanish-language** version of the authorization form is also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for all release-of-information purposes, not dedicated patient access forms. However, the form does accommodate patient self-access reasonably well: **"Self" is the first checkbox** in the recipient section, and the default purpose is "For Personal use if not otherwise stated." The form explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 (the individual right of access provision). While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, patient self-access is clearly a recognized use case rather than an afterthought.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately returned the Mercy Health medical records page. The centralized page is well-organized with facility-specific fax numbers, links to forms (English and Spanish), and information about MyChart and eRequest options. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing the best available PDF form (form-1, the text-layer version): it is a **single-page**, well-organized form with a logical flow from patient demographics through facility selection, date range, record types, recipient, delivery method, purpose, and legal disclosures. The form offers granular record-type checkboxes (10 specific categories plus "Other" and "Entire record") and four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email). Format defaults to electronic (PDF/CD) if unspecified.

However, neither form has **fillable fields** — both require printing and handwriting. Form-1 at least has a proper text layer making it searchable and compatible with assistive technology. Form-2, the currently linked version, is a flat scan that is completely inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally at all. The replacement of a functional digital PDF with an image scan is a notable regression.

## Barriers

- **Photo ID required**: The form states "Photo ID required at the time of request," which could exclude patients without government-issued identification.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "There may be a charge for copies of records" provides no specific amounts or fee schedule.
- **"Standard two years" default**: The "Entire record" option defaults to two years of information unless otherwise specified — patients expecting their full history may receive only a subset.
- No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission — fax, mail, MyChart, and secure email are available.

## Notable Strengths

- Multiple request pathways including MyChart and Swellbox/Datavant online portal
- Spanish-language form available
- "Self" as the first recipient option; electronic format as default
- Explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation
- Single-page form design
- Centralized, easy-to-navigate medical records page

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The availability of MyChart and the Swellbox online portal significantly elevates the digital pathway beyond the PDF forms alone. The PDF forms themselves are adequate in content design but limited by the lack of fillable fields, and the current primary linked form (an image scan) represents a troubling accessibility regression. The generic HIPAA authorization approach — while clearly accommodating patient self-access — falls short of a dedicated patient access pathway. The overall experience is functional but not exemplary.

# El Centro de Corazón — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

El Centro de Corazón is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Houston, Texas. It offers a single downloadable PDF form for health information disclosure — a bilingual (English/Spanish) "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information." This form is the only pathway available for patients seeking their own medical records, and it is oriented entirely toward third-party release of information rather than patient self-access.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page authorization for disclosure hosted on the organization's WordPress site. Page 1 is in English, page 2 is a Spanish translation. No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified. The form's fax number (713-926-9105) is printed on the document, suggesting fax is an accepted submission method, though this is not explicitly stated as a submission instruction. No email, portal, or other electronic submission options are mentioned.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

El Centro de Corazón does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses a "provide to / receive from (circle one)" structure that presumes records flow between El Centro and another entity. There is no "send records to me, the patient" option. Among the nine reason-for-disclosure checkboxes (Continuing of Care, Financial Insurance Verification, Legal Proceedings, etc.), none corresponds to "personal/patient request." A patient wanting their own records must use the "Other (Specify)" write-in, which is unintuitive and signals that patient self-access was not a design consideration.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), does not include any patient rights language, and does not ask how the patient would like to receive their records (mail, electronic, in-person pickup). This is a generic HIPAA authorization form pressed into service for all disclosure scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned a direct link to the PDF on El Centro's WordPress site. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication was encountered. The URL structure (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/...`) is a standard WordPress media path — functional but not linked from a clearly labeled "Medical Records" or "Patient Resources" page. The form appears to date from August 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive form fields). It must be printed and completed by hand — the design uses underscore-line blanks and a "circle one" instruction that are hallmarks of print-era forms. The text layer is present (not a scan), so the content is readable and searchable, but there is no digital-first workflow available.

**Field count** is modest: patient name, DOB, phone number, the other party's information, reason checkboxes, information-type checkboxes, a sensitive-information acknowledgment, and signature/date fields — roughly 12–15 fields per language. At one page per language, the form is compact and not overwhelming.

**Layout** is functional but dense. Section headers are minimal; the form flows as a single block of content. Language is relatively plain, though legal constructs appear ("I hereby authorize"). A grammatical error exists in both versions regarding re-disclosure language.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Witness signature line**: Present on both English and Spanish versions. HIPAA does not require a witness for authorization forms. While the line appears optional (no mandatory language), its presence may lead staff to enforce it as required, creating an unnecessary barrier.
- **Fee disclosure**: Vague — "I understand that I may be charged for the copies of health records I have requested" — with no specifics about amounts, HIPAA cost-based limits, or dispute processes.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization defaults to 90 days, which is reasonable for third-party disclosures but irrelevant for patient access requests (which must be fulfilled within 30 days).
- **No delivery format options**: The form does not ask how the patient wants to receive records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual (English/Spanish)**: Providing a full Spanish translation on the same document is a meaningful accessibility feature for an FQHC serving Houston's predominantly Spanish-speaking communities. This is uncommon and commendable.
- **Compact design**: One page per language avoids the multi-page complexity that discourages completion.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient self-access pathway**: The form's entire structure is oriented toward third-party disclosure. A patient exercising their Right of Access is a second-class user.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive fields; purely a print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Checkbox mismatch**: The Spanish version omits "Billing Records" as a checkbox option, creating a translation inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

El Centro de Corazón provides a findable, compact, bilingual form — but it is a generic third-party authorization that does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The non-fillable format, lack of patient rights language, ambiguous witness requirement, and vague fee disclosure all contribute to a below-average patient experience. The bilingual design is a genuine bright spot that partially offsets the form's structural shortcomings.

# Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola is a community hospital in the Florida panhandle, part of the Ascension health system — one of the largest nonprofit Catholic health systems in the United States. The facility uses Ascension's market-specific forms for the Florida panhandle region rather than purely facility-level documents. Two PDF forms were found during retrieval, along with references to a Swellbox-powered online records request portal and an Ascension patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Most Relevant Form

Three pathways exist for patients requesting their own records:

1. **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary): The facility's medical records page directs patients to a Swellbox-powered online request wizard — a third-party vendor platform purpose-built for patient record requests. This is the org's preferred channel.
2. **PDF authorization form (form-1.pdf)**: A traditional single-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Information From Ascension Sacred Heart," form number FFM99-8700-010-00 (rev 8/20). This is the general-purpose ROI form covering four Ascension Sacred Heart facilities in the Florida panhandle.
3. **Ascension patient portal**: The medical records page also references the patient portal for direct record access.

A second PDF (form-2.pdf) was found but is irrelevant for patient self-access — it is a department-specific inbound records release for the Radiation Oncology department, designed for transferring records *from* other providers *to* Sacred Heart. It uses outdated "Sacred Heart Health System" branding, contains multiple typos, and dates from 2016.

**Form-1 is the most relevant downloadable document** for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does not offer a dedicated patient-access PDF form distinct from third-party authorization. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed to cover all release scenarios — patients, insurers, attorneys, and other third parties all use the same document. A patient requesting their own records must check the "Patient Named Above" box to indicate they are both the patient and recipient, and select "At the request of the patient" as the purpose. This works but requires the patient to navigate a form designed for a broader audience.

However, the Swellbox online portal serves as a de facto dedicated patient access pathway. Online records request wizards are specifically designed for patient-initiated requests, providing a more guided experience than the generic PDF form. The existence of this portal partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient-access PDF.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. The primary PDF was discovered on the first web search using standard ROI-related keywords and downloaded without any bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or browser fallback requirements. The form is hosted on Ascension's content delivery system at a stable, descriptive URL. However, a patient navigating the website organically would be directed to the Swellbox portal rather than the PDF — the downloadable form is available but not prominently linked from the website's navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

**Technical format**: The PDF has a text layer (not a scan) but zero fillable/interactive fields. All blanks are underscores — patients must print and handwrite. Despite being digitally authored with 7 embedded fonts, it was designed entirely for a print-and-fill workflow.

**Layout and organization**: The single-page form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient information → purpose → format preference → report type checkboxes → facility/date selection → sensitive information authorization → legal disclosures → signature. The checkbox layout for report types and facility selection is clean and practical.

**Language**: The upper portion uses reasonably plain language. The lower third shifts to dense legal text — the sensitive information authorization bundles HIV, AIDS, psychiatric conditions, substance abuse, sickle cell anemia, STDs, and hepatitis into a single all-or-nothing binary decision in one long sentence. The revocation rights section runs together without paragraph breaks.

**Instructions**: Minimal. There are no instructions for how or where to submit the completed form. A note warns: "If you fail to specify which records you desire, you will only receive a copy of the discharge summary" — defaulting to minimal disclosure when patients don't navigate the checkbox list correctly.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number as a standard field — unnecessary for patient access and creates identity theft risk.
- **Purpose marked "REQUIRED"**: HIPAA does not require patients to state a reason for accessing their own records, though the pre-printed "At the request of the patient" option reduces the practical burden.
- **Default to minimal records**: The discharge-summary-only default if record types aren't specified may result in patients receiving less than they're entitled to.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. Patients have no advance notice of potential fees.
- **Internal EHR navigation paths visible**: Staff-facing filing instructions appear in the form footer, suggesting the document wasn't reviewed for patient-facing use.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox online portal as primary pathway**: Directing patients to a dedicated digital request wizard is a significant positive.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: One form covers four Ascension Sacred Heart locations — patients with care across facilities don't need separate forms.
- **Electronic format option**: The form offers a choice between electronic and paper delivery, though "electronic" is undefined.
- **Concise single-page design**: All content fits on one page without excessive cramming.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola provides a **mixed but functional** experience. The organization's strength lies in offering a Swellbox online portal as the primary pathway — a genuinely patient-centered digital option. However, the fallback PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, unnecessary SSN collection, and no submission instructions. The form is easy to find but was clearly designed for institutional workflow rather than patient self-service. A patient who uses the Swellbox portal will likely have a reasonable experience; one who downloads the PDF will face a traditional print-and-mail workflow with some compliance concerns.

# Community Health Centers of Burlington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Community Health Centers of Burlington (CHCB) provides two downloadable PDF forms for health information disclosure. **Form-1** ("Authorization to Send Health Information," revised November 2023) is the primary ROI form — a one-page, fillable PDF covering medical, mental health/psychiatric, and dental records. **Form-2** ("Authorization for Verbal Communication (Only)") is a companion form limited to verbal disclosures; it explicitly states "No paper records will be sent" and is not relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own records.

No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or web-based form wizard was identified. The primary pathway for a patient requesting records is to download form-1, complete it, and submit it — though submission instructions are notably absent from the form itself.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

CHCB does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization/disclosure form designed to serve all release purposes. However, it includes a "Patient copy" checkbox under "Reason for Release" alongside options like "Coordination of care," "Transfer care," and "Legal purposes." This checkbox normalizes patient self-access as a legitimate use case, even though the form's structure — with "Information REQUESTED FROM" and "Information RELEASED TO" blocks — is oriented toward third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate sender/recipient fields that don't map intuitively to a self-access request, creating potential confusion.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), nor does it include plain-language statements about patient rights to access their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required a site-scoped web search (`site:chcb.org`), which immediately returned a direct link to the PDF in a WordPress uploads directory. The organization's own forms page (`chcb.org/forms/`) did not render content — likely due to JavaScript rendering — meaning a patient navigating the website directly would have difficulty finding the form without resorting to a search engine. No bot-blocking or download difficulties were encountered. Findability is moderate: easily searchable but not prominently surfaced through the site's own navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-executed digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 36 interactive form fields, a clean text layer, and a modest 164 KB file size. The one-page design is impressively compact, covering three record categories (medical, mental health, dental) with date ranges, legal disclosures, and a revocation section. The layout is dense but readable, using bold headers, checkboxes, and horizontal rules to organize content.

Language is a mix of accessible plain English in the record-selection sections and standard legal boilerplate in the disclosure paragraph. The record type options are well-designed — patients can choose complete records or specify particular items, with date ranges available for medical and mental health categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

**No submission instructions.** The most significant gap is the absence of any guidance on how to submit the completed form. The header lists a fax number and email for receiving records *at* CHCB, but there is no explicit instruction for returning the completed authorization. A patient would likely have to call the office to ask. **No fees are mentioned** — neither disclosed nor waived. **No notarization** is required, and the form explicitly states that photocopies and facsimiles are valid, removing a common barrier. The conditioning-of-treatment language is legally accurate but could intimidate patients. A line about verbal communication, apparently carried over from the verbal-only companion form, creates minor confusion about what the form authorizes.

## Notable Strengths

- **"Patient copy" checkbox** explicitly normalizes patient self-access as a standard reason for release
- **One-page fillable PDF** with 36 interactive fields enables complete digital form-filling
- **Photocopy/facsimile acceptance** explicitly stated, removing an access barrier
- **Granular record selection** with date ranges gives patients control over scope
- **Revocation section** clearly states the right to revoke consent at any time

## Overall Assessment

CHCB provides a technically competent, concise authorization form that a patient *can* use to request their own records, but the experience is not designed around patient self-access. The generic disclosure framing, absence of submission instructions, lack of patient rights language, and sender/recipient confusion when used for self-access all point to a form built for provider-to-provider information exchange that accommodates patients as a secondary use case. The fillable design and compact layout are genuine strengths, but the missing submission pathway is a meaningful gap in the patient experience.

# WakeMed Health & Hospitals — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

WakeMed Health & Hospitals provides a single ROI authorization form ("Authorization to Release Medical Information," N-935, revised 11/25) available in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf, N-935S). These are the same form translated — not separate documents for different purposes. Both are linked from the Health Information Management (HIM) page under Patients and Visitors → Medical Records. There is no online portal, no web-based request wizard, and no dedicated patient-access form. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it by hand, and submitting via email (HIMROI@Wakemed.org), fax (919-350-1720), or mail.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

WakeMed does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization that covers both releasing and obtaining PHI. A patient requesting their own records selects "Personal" from a list of five purposes (Billing/Insurance, Patient Care, Personal, Legal, Other) and must fill in a "Recipient" field — a concept that doesn't map cleanly when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form asks for the name of the "Person, Organization, or Facility you want us to release your PHI to," which creates an awkward fit for a simple "send me my records" request. This is a generic_hipaa_auth pathway, not a patient-centric design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A web search for WakeMed's ROI authorization immediately surfaced the correct page. The only friction was that an older URL (/assets/documents/...) was stale and returned HTML, requiring navigation to the HIM page to locate the current PDF links under /sites/default/files/pdf/. Once there, both language versions are clearly labeled and downloadable without bot blocking or access restrictions. Difficulty: moderate — easy via search, but required one redirect.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. Checkboxes are rendered as the letter "o" in text, and blanks are underscores — a purely print-and-handwrite design. The form has a text layer (not an image scan), so the content is readable on screen, but a patient cannot complete it digitally without third-party annotation tools.

Layout and organization are strong points. The 2-page form flows logically: patient/recipient information → record types and date ranges → format and delivery preferences (page 1), then understanding/consent → authorization/signature → revocation → contact information (page 2). Section headers are bold and uppercase. Record type selection is granular, with specific options for office visits, hospital admissions, ED visits, imaging studies, and sub-components like discharge summaries and lab reports. The date-of-visit field is flexibly worded ("Specify the date, date range, or other specific description of your visit").

Language is reasonably plain, though the UNDERSTANDING section on page 2 leans toward legal formality with a series of "I understand..." statements. These are necessary disclosures (re-disclosure risk, revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment) but add density.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No unnecessary barriers**: No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission. Multiple electronic submission channels (email and fax). Identity verification is mentioned but framed permissively ("proof of my identity... may be requested").

**Fee disclosure is vague**: The form warns that "any and/or all" requests and large-volume requests are processed by WakeMed's copy service and "a fee will be charged," but provides no schedule, estimate, or reference to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based standard. A patient cannot predict costs before submitting.

**Notable bright spots**: (1) A Spanish-language version exists — uncommon in this study — though it has translation gaps, with key field labels ("Address where you want your PHI sent to," "Email address") remaining in English. (2) Six delivery methods are offered: mail, fax, pick up, onsite review, MyChart (for records after 2/1/2015), and email with encrypted delivery as the default. (3) Email submission of the form itself removes a significant access barrier. (4) The form was recently revised (11/25), suggesting active maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

WakeMed provides a competent, well-organized ROI form with multiple submission and delivery channels, a Spanish translation, and no major procedural barriers. Its primary weakness is the lack of a patient-centric access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization form designed for all disclosure purposes, and the non-fillable PDF format forces a print-and-handwrite workflow. The form is adequate for its purpose but falls short of best practice in digital accessibility and patient-centeredness. Grade: **B** (3.50).

# Decatur County Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Decatur County Hospital (Leon, IA) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in rural Iowa. The facility offers a single authorization form — "Authorization for Access, Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (DCH-#0001) — for all medical records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway; the same generic HIPAA authorization form serves both patients requesting their own records and third-party release scenarios.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form's opening language reads: "I, the undersigned authorize and request Decatur County Hospital to: Allow access, use or disclosure of my protected health information to: OR obtain from:" — presenting patient access and third-party release as two branches of the same document. A patient simply wanting to view or obtain copies of their own records must navigate fields designed for third-party recipients (recipient organization, address, fax number) that are irrelevant to their situation. The form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox, which is the closest it comes to acknowledging individual access rights, but there is no explicit reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524. No patient portal-based records request workflow or online submission mechanism was identified.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. While initial broad web searches failed, a site-scoped search quickly located the PDF linked from the hospital's Patient Portal page. The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0001-Auth-for-Access-Use-or-Disclosure-of-PHI.pdf`) is descriptive, and no bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. For a small rural hospital, the form's online availability is commendable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a genuine bright spot in terms of technical design. Created with Acrobat PDFMaker for Word, it is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 61 AcroForm interactive fields — covering patient demographics, record type checkboxes, purpose options, sensitive-records initials, fee agreement, and signatures. Nearly every blank on the form can be completed electronically without printing. However, AcroForm field names are empty, which would hinder screen reader accessibility.

The form fits everything onto a single page — admirably compact but visually dense. The logical flow is sound (patient identity → recipient → dates → record types → purpose → sensitive records → fees → legal text → signature), but cramming 61 fields, 13 record-type checkboxes, and multiple legal paragraphs onto one page likely challenges readability. The first half uses straightforward language, while the second half descends into dense regulatory prose, particularly the re-disclosure paragraph citing 42 CFR Part 2 and Iowa Code chapters 228 and 141.

Record-type granularity is a strength: patients can select from 13 specific categories (Discharge Summary, H&P, Consultation, Radiology, Progress Notes, OR Report, Pathology, Labs, ER Notes, EKG, PT/OT/ST, Photographs) plus "Other" and a "Review only" option. This gives patients meaningful control over scope.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Social Security Number**: The form requests SSN — unnecessary for patient identification under HIPAA and a significant identity-theft risk on a form that may be faxed or mailed. A medical record number (included as "for office use only") is sufficient.

**Blank fee amount**: The fee disclosure states the hospital "may impose a fee of [blank]" and asks patients to agree to unspecified costs. This prevents patients from making informed decisions about fees before submitting their request.

**No delivery format options**: The form lacks any field for patients to specify how they want to receive records (mail, electronic, in-person). HIPAA § 164.524(c)(2)(i) requires entities to provide records in the form and format requested if readily producible.

**Outdated**: Last reviewed March 2018 — nearly eight years old, predating the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective 2021).

**Binding language**: The statement that authorization provisions "take precedence over statements made in the Decatur County Hospital's Notice of Privacy Practices" is potentially misleading, suggesting patients might be waiving protections.

## Strengths

The form includes an explicit conditioning prohibition (treatment will not be conditioned on signing), clear revocation instructions with a mailing address, and appropriate separate-initials requirements for sensitive records (substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS) under applicable federal and state law. The comprehensive record-type granularity and digital-first fillable design are notable positives.

## Overall Assessment

Decatur County Hospital provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records access. The fillable PDF is technically sound, but the generic authorization approach, SSN collection, blank fee amount, outdated review date, and absence of delivery format options collectively place this facility below the standard patients should expect for exercising their individual access rights.

# Consensus Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Consensus Health operates as a decentralized network of independent physician practices in New Jersey. Four documents were retrieved, but none is a dedicated patient records request form. The most relevant document for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf**, a generic, unbranded one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN — not on any Consensus Health website. The remaining three documents are Consensus Health–branded intake paperwork from Skylands Medical Group (a member practice): a general consent/disclosure/authorization form (form-2), a HIPAA acknowledgment (form-3), and a seven-page Notice of Privacy Practices (form-4). None of these serves as a patient-initiated records request mechanism.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Consensus Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The only ROI-adjacent form (form-1) is framed entirely as a third-party disclosure authorization — its language ("authorize the disclosure of information from my health record" to a named "Person/Organization/Facility") assumes records are being sent to someone other than the patient. There is no form, process, or web page designed for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The organization appears to direct patients to the athenahealth patient portal or to contact the office by phone, but no documented ROI workflow exists through either channel.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any relevant form was **extremely difficult**. The main Consensus Health website has no patient forms section. Extensive searching — direct navigation, URL guessing across multiple paths, site-specific searches, and PDF filetype searches — produced nothing. The generic ROI form was only found through a general web search linking to a PatientPop-hosted PDF loosely associated with Consensus Health practices. The Consensus Health–branded documents were discovered on a member practice's WordPress site (Skylands Medical Group), not on any Consensus Health–owned domain. A patient visiting consensushealth.com would find no path to an ROI form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available ROI document, is a bare-bones single-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects approximately 11 fields (patient name, record number, address, DOB, free-text information requested, free-text purpose, recipient name/address/phone, and signature/date). The layout is plain and functional, and the language is reasonably clear. However, the form is critically incomplete: it provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or any indication of where to send the completed form. It carries no organizational branding, so a patient cannot confirm it belongs to their provider. A patient completing this form would have no idea what to do with it.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No submission pathway**: The form provides zero information about how to submit it — a functional barrier that effectively renders the form unusable without outside knowledge.
- **Missing HIPAA-required authorization elements**: The form lacks an expiration date, revocation language, and the name of the disclosing entity — elements required under 45 CFR § 164.508(c) for a valid authorization.
- **"Record Number" field**: The form asks for a medical record number without explaining where the patient would find this.
- **Vague fee language**: The NPP (form-4) mentions "reasonable fees" for copies but provides no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **"Proprietary & Confidential" marking** on the NPP — an odd designation for a document HIPAA requires to be publicly available.

## Notable Strengths

- The **Notice of Privacy Practices** (form-4) is substantive and current (Version 2.0, 2025), including reproductive health care protections reflecting the 2024 HIPAA Final Rule and explicit acknowledgment of patients' right to electronic access.
- The NPP states a **30-day response commitment** for records requests, aligning with HIPAA standards.
- The consent form (form-2) has a well-designed **authorized individuals section** with granular health/payment disclosure options and a detailed **contact preferences** section.

## Overall Assessment

Consensus Health presents a significant challenge for patients seeking their own medical records online. The organization has no centralized patient forms infrastructure, no dedicated records request form, and no documented electronic submission pathway. The only ROI-adjacent form found is an unbranded, non-fillable, third-party authorization template that lacks essential information for a patient to act on it. While the athenahealth patient portal may offer an alternative pathway, this is not documented or promoted as a records request mechanism. The decentralized practice model means patients at different member practices may have different (and equally opaque) experiences. This organization's approach to patient records access is best characterized as an afterthought — not hostile, but functionally absent from its public-facing digital presence.

# Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital is part of Samaritan Health Services (SHS), a nonprofit regional health system in Oregon's Willamette Valley. All records request forms and processes operate at the system level — there are no facility-specific forms for the Lebanon campus. Five documents were retrieved: a standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information in English (form-4) and Spanish (form-5), a specialized Computer Readable EHI Export Request in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3).

## Pathways Available

SHS offers three distinct pathways for patients requesting their own records:

1. **MRO Express Online Portal** — The primary pathway the website directs patients toward. This is an outsourced third-party portal (MRO Corp.) for submitting records requests online. No downloadable PDF is produced; the request is web-based.

2. **Standard Authorization Form (form-4/form-5)** — A general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" PDF covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Submittable by mail, fax, or email. Available in English and Spanish.

3. **EHI Computer Readable Export Form (form-1/form-2)** — A specialized form for requesting health information in machine-readable format. Also available in English and Spanish. This is a notably rare offering.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The standard form (form-4) is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it handles the distinction reasonably well: Section 3 includes a "Personal" checkbox for purpose, and Section 7 splits into "released to myself" (with multiple delivery options) versus "OR release my records to" a third party. This is a combined form, not a dedicated patient access pathway, but the dual structure is functional and the patient self-access route is clearly accommodated.

The EHI export form (form-1) is genuinely patient-centric — its purpose field comes pre-checked as "Patient Request - Electronic" and the entire form is designed around patient self-access. However, this serves only the niche use case of computer-readable data export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the downloadable forms was **difficult**. The medical records request page primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal. The PDF form download links are hidden inside a collapsed accordion section titled "Sending a Request by Mail or Fax" that required browser DevTools (JavaScript link extraction) to discover. Web searches returned confusable results from unrelated organizations with similar names. A patient who prefers a traditional form rather than the online portal would struggle to find the PDF.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-4) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean text and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete it by hand despite the form being digital in origin. The form uses numbered sections (1–9) with clear headers and a matching instruction page. The language mixes functional plain language with legal boilerplate; the rights section is dense but the instructions on page 2 are more accessible. Record type granularity is strong, with 11 specific checkboxes plus an "Other" field.

Format and delivery options are a genuine bright spot: patients can choose from MyChart, email, paper, CD, fax, or write in an alternative. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery, which is uncommon among ROI forms.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees**: The fee disclosure is exemplary. Form-4 explicitly states "Initial Patient Request: No Charge" and "Continuing Care: No Charge," with fees only for third-party requests. However, the EHI export form (form-1) lacks this "no charge" language, stating only that "reasonable cost-based fees apply" — an inconsistency that could deter patients seeking computer-readable data.

**Processing time**: Stated as "up to 30 days," within HIPAA's permitted window.

**No notarization** required. No in-person-only submission requirement — mail, fax, and email are all accepted.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by mail, fax (541-768-9363), or email (SHSHIMROI@samhealth.org). The email option is notable — it allows fully electronic submission even without the MRO portal, though the non-fillable PDF creates an awkward print-fill-scan-email workflow.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: All forms (standard ROI and EHI export) are available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Dedicated EHI export form**: Offering a separate form specifically for computer-readable health information export is exceptionally rare and demonstrates genuine Cures Act awareness.
- **Fee transparency**: The three-tier fee structure with "No Charge" for patient requests is clear and patient-friendly.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Six format options including two electronic channels (MyChart and email).
- **Email submission channel**: Accepting form submission via email lowers barriers significantly.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDFs**: All forms have zero interactive fields despite being digitally authored — a clear missed opportunity.
- **Hidden download links**: The downloadable forms are buried in collapsed accordion sections, requiring technical effort to discover.
- **No dedicated patient access form**: The standard form serves both patient self-access and third-party release, requiring patients to navigate which sections apply.
- **EHI export fee ambiguity**: The EHI form does not match the standard form's "no charge" commitment for patient requests.

## Overall Assessment

Samaritan Health Services provides a solid, above-average experience for patients requesting their own records. The combination of an online portal as the primary pathway, a well-structured authorization form with multiple delivery options, bilingual availability, transparent fee disclosures, and a rare dedicated EHI export form puts this organization ahead of most peers. The main gaps are the non-fillable PDF forms and the poor discoverability of the downloadable form option. The organization clearly takes patient access seriously, even if the form design hasn't been fully modernized for digital-first completion.

# Synthesis: Aurora Medical Center - Grafton

## Overview

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton is a community hospital in Grafton, Wisconsin, operated by Advocate Health (formerly Advocate Aurora Health). The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones, drawing from Aurora Health Care's centralized medical records infrastructure. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also directs patients to its LiveWell patient portal for online record access.

## Forms and Pathways

Three forms were downloaded:

- **Form-1 and Form-2** are identical copies (same form number S300503 Rev. 11/25, same byte size) of the general "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a third-party release form designed for authorizing disclosure to other providers, insurers, or attorneys. Two URLs exist for the same document, a minor source of confusion.
- **Form-3** is a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" (S88411-EN Rev. 11/25) — explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It features a "Myself" checkbox, omits the purpose-of-release requirement, and opens with a callout to the LiveWell patient portal.

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3**. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, separate from the third-party authorization, is a meaningful structural choice that many organizations fail to make.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Aurora clearly differentiates individual access from third-party release. Form-3 is titled and structured around the patient's own request — no "Release the Requested Information to" recipient block, no purpose-of-release field, and a prominent "Myself" option. The patient portal callout ("Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org") is placed at the very top of the form, proactively directing patients to a faster digital channel before they even begin filling out the paper form. This is a best-practice design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Aurora Health Care maintains a well-organized medical records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records`, reachable in about two clicks from the homepage. The page clearly lists all available forms with download links, including English and Spanish versions, instruction sheets, restriction request forms, accounting of disclosures, and revocation forms. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The forms also appeared in web search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean typography and logical section flow: patient demographics → treatment context → record type selection → recipient → delivery method → signature. The record-type selection is impressively granular, with 22+ checkbox options spanning medical records, imaging by modality, billing documents, and laboratory reports. The language is plain and accessible — the sensitive-information acknowledgment is straightforward without being alarming.

However, despite being digitally produced, form-3 has **zero interactive fillable fields**. All checkboxes are static glyphs, and all blanks require handwriting. This is the form's most significant weakness — adding fillable fields would be trivial for the design team and would dramatically improve the digital experience. The form is designed as a print-and-fill artifact published as a PDF.

## Submission and Delivery

The medical records page lists multiple submission methods: email, fax, mail, and in-person delivery. The form itself offers multiple delivery methods for receiving records: paper by mail, encrypted email, CD, patient portal, and in-person pickup. Offering both encrypted email and patient portal as electronic delivery options is progressive. The note "(Fees may apply)" appears but no fee amounts or schedule are provided — a common ambiguity.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The form correctly omits a purpose-of-release requirement for patient access. Non-discrimination language is present on the third-party form. Minor authorization provisions are detailed and legally careful. The main compliance gap is the vague fee disclosure — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

## Overall Assessment

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton, through its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form, a patient portal alternative, Spanish translations, and granular record-type selection. The retrieval experience is excellent and the content design is clear and well-organized. The primary weakness is the non-fillable PDF format, which forces a paper workflow despite the form being digitally authored. This technical gap prevents the organization from reaching the top tier, but the overall experience is solidly good — a patient requesting their own records has a clear, well-documented pathway with multiple submission and delivery options.

**Grade: B** (weighted score: 4.15/5.0)

# CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital is a critical access hospital in Long Prairie, MN, part of the CentraCare regional health system based in St. Cloud. Long Prairie does not maintain its own facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it uses CentraCare's system-wide "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available from a centralized medical records release page at centracare.com. Three documents were found: the main ROI authorization form, a companion instruction sheet, and a separate substance use disorder consent form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

CentraCare does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for all releases of information — to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the "Release Information From" and "Release Information To" fields, placing themselves in the "To" field — an unintuitive workflow for someone who simply wants a copy of their own chart. There is no separate patient access request form, no dedicated section for individual access, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

That said, the form does include a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which normalizes patient self-requests and helps HIM staff route them appropriately. The companion instruction document (form-2) provides clear, section-by-section guidance written in second person, explaining not just *what* to fill in but *why* each field matters — an unusual and helpful touch.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. Web searches converged on CentraCare's centralized patient resources page, which logically organizes the forms. However, a patient searching specifically for "Long Prairie Hospital medical records form" must recognize that Long Prairie uses system-wide CentraCare forms and navigate accordingly. Direct download via automated tools (`curl`) was blocked by bot protection, requiring browser-based retrieval — a concern for assistive technologies and non-standard browsers.

## Form Document Quality

The main authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, despite its digital origins, it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand, or use third-party PDF annotation tools. This is a significant gap for a regional health system. The form has approximately 15–20 fields across patient demographics, release from/to addresses, record type checkboxes, delivery method, reason for release, and signature/date.

The layout is clean and logically structured: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Information to be Released → Special Disclosure → Preferred Method → Reason → Authorization → Revocation. Page 2 provides a comprehensive directory of all CentraCare HIM offices organized by region with fax numbers, phone, mail addresses, and a shared email. The language is mostly accessible, though the revocation paragraph contains dense legalese that may confuse patients.

## Submission and Delivery

CentraCare offers strong submission and delivery options. Completed forms can be submitted by **email** (CCHROI@CentraCare.com), **fax**, or **mail** — email submission is prominently featured and works for all locations. Records can be delivered via paper, CD, encrypted email, or MyChart portal. This is a genuinely patient-friendly set of options, particularly the encrypted email and MyChart delivery channels.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person submission requirement. No fee information is disclosed on either the form or the instructions, though the instructions reference "who may be responsible for the cost of records" without specifying amounts. No response time commitment is stated. The anti-re-release clause ("I do not authorize re-release of this information to anyone") is embedded as non-optional boilerplate rather than a patient choice. The form-3 SUD consent is an image-only scan with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers — but this is a supplementary document, not the primary pathway.

## Overall Assessment

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital provides a **functional but not patient-centered** records request process. The strong points are the multiple electronic submission channels (especially email), diverse delivery options (MyChart, encrypted email), the "Personal Use" reason checkbox, and the unusually helpful instruction document. The weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable form requiring print-and-handwrite, the absence of fee disclosure, and the lack of any patient rights information. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was designed for third-party release and the patient must adapt to it. Grade: **B**.

# Duke University Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Duke Health provides four documents related to records release. The most relevant for a patient requesting their own records is **form-4.pdf** (M3132, Rev. 3/2025), the current enterprise-wide Authorization for Release of Information. This is a single-page, fillable PDF with 67 interactive fields, hosted on a well-organized medical records landing page. The companion **form-2.pdf** is a 3-page plain-language instruction sheet walking patients through each section of the authorization. Form-1 is an older revision of the same M3132 form (Rev. 4/2024) that remains accessible at a stale URL, and form-3 is an image-only scan of an even older revision posted on a satellite Duke outpatient clinic site — both are superseded and inferior to form-4.

Duke also mentions that Spanish-language versions are available on the official forms page, and the forms page links to additional documents (verbal release form, proxy access form, external records request).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Duke does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The M3132 authorization is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to serve both patient self-requests and third-party releases (attorneys, insurers, other providers). However, the form accommodates patient access reasonably well: Part B includes a "Self (Same Info As Above)" checkbox, Part D lists "Personal" as the first purpose option, and Part E prominently features "My Duke Health (Patients Only)" as a delivery method. The companion instructions explicitly address patients requesting their own records ("If you are the patient and are requesting the records be sent to you, select 'Self'"). While functional, a patient must still navigate sections designed for third-party scenarios, and the form doesn't distinguish the differing legal frameworks (Right of Access vs. Authorization) that apply to each case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy** — rated as a 2-click path from the Duke Health homepage (Medical Records → Authorization Forms). The official forms page is clearly titled, well-organized, and lists all available downloads. Web searches readily surface direct PDF URLs. The only retrieval concern is stale URLs: the older form-1 revision remains accessible via search engines, and a satellite Duke site hosts an image-only scan (form-3) that was uploaded as recently as June 2024 despite being from 2022.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the current primary form, is a strong digital-first artifact. It contains **67 fillable interactive fields** on a single page — enabling patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing. The layout follows a logical six-part structure (Patient Info → Recipient → Records to Release → Purpose → Delivery Format → Review/Approval) with clear section headers. The record-type selection offers excellent granularity: 14+ individual report categories, treatment date ranges, and facility-specific or enterprise-wide options. Sensible defaults are transparently stated ("Last 2 years of active treatment will be provided unless specified"). The language is generally clear and functional, though the legal disclosure text in Part F is dense. The companion instruction document (form-2) defines each medical record type in accessible language — an unusually thorough support resource.

## Barriers and Concerns

Duke imposes no notarization requirement; the witness section from the older revision has been removed entirely. Submission channels are robust: email, fax, and mail, with a phone number for questions. No in-person requirement exists. However, several issues merit attention:

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number — not required by HIPAA and an unnecessary privacy risk when medical record number and date of birth are also collected.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Duke Health may charge a fee" with "Charges may apply" noted for CD and paper delivery, but no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Patients must affirmatively check boxes for Mental/Behavioral Health and Genetic Testing to receive those portions of their own records — arguably a barrier for patient self-access, where HIPAA grants access to the complete designated record set. The form mentions HIV/AIDS in the text but provides no corresponding checkbox, creating ambiguity.
- **Unnamed form fields**: All 67 fillable fields lack descriptive names, creating an accessibility gap for screen reader users.

## Strengths

Duke excels in several areas: multiple electronic delivery options (MyChart patient portal, encrypted email, fax), granular record-type selection, companion instructions with plain-language medical definitions, multiple submission channels, and a clean digital-first form design. The existence of a separate instruction document with a helpline number demonstrates genuine investment in patient guidance. Electronic delivery options are listed first in Part E, signaling a preference for digital fulfillment.

## Overall Assessment

Duke University Hospital provides a well-organized, technically competent records request experience anchored by a strong fillable PDF form and excellent companion documentation. The primary limitation is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization designed for all release scenarios. The form handles patient self-requests adequately through its "Self" checkbox and "Personal" purpose option, but doesn't inform patients of their Right of Access or distinguish the simpler patient-access legal framework from third-party authorization. Minor concerns around SSN collection, vague fee disclosure, and sensitive-information opt-in prevent a top-tier rating, but overall this is an above-average experience.

# Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph offers two versions of the same general-purpose ROI authorization form (Form #3014) linked from different pages of its website. Form-1 (dated 03/28/2019) is the current version, found on the Health Information Management page under "Authorizations and Forms." Form-2 (dated 11/24/2015) is an older version linked from the Privacy Policy > HIPAA Authorization Form page. Both are flat (non-fillable) PDFs. A third version in .docx format with entirely outdated "Heartland Health" branding was also discoverable via web search. The organization additionally uses Epic MyChart as a patient portal, though the ROI forms make no mention of it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mosaic Life Care does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both form versions are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request to Another Agency," framing the process as a release of records to a third party. A patient wanting their own records must fill in themselves as both the requesting party and the recipient. While "Personal" appears among 12 purpose options, there is no language, section, or streamlined flow that addresses HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) as a distinct use case. The form does not reference the Right of Access by name, does not explain associated timelines or fee limits, and does not mention the patient portal as an alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were relatively easy to find — 2–3 clicks from the homepage via the HIM page. Site-specific search also surfaced the relevant pages. The main complication is fragmentation: two versions of the same form (same form number) are published simultaneously on different pages with no indication of which supersedes the other. This creates a risk that patients encounter the outdated 2015 version, which still references the organization's former name ("Heartland Regional Medical Center") in its legal disclaimer.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) has a text layer and is not a scan, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore placeholders, requiring the patient to print and handwrite responses. The 2-page form follows a logical flow (demographics → source facility → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature) and uses a two-column layout that makes efficient use of space. The 13-category record type checklist with an "Other" option provides granular control over what is released. However, the language mixes plain and legal styles, with the deceased-patient section and legal disclaimers being notably dense. The form requires a purpose selection ("must select one"), which is not required under HIPAA for patient self-access requests.

## Barriers and Notable Issues

No notarization is required. Forms can be submitted via email (ROI@myMLC.com), fax, or mail — multiple electronic submission channels are available, and in-person delivery is not required. However, form-1 says nothing about fees, while the older form-2 vaguely mentions records "may be subject to copying fees" without specifying amounts or HIPAA fee limits. No response time commitment is stated. The mandatory purpose field is a potential compliance concern for patient self-access requests. An "Identification type / Verified by" line on the form could mislead patients into thinking in-person ID verification is required, though the form can be submitted remotely.

## Strengths

The standout bright spot is the 15-language assistance notice on page 2 of form-1, covering an unusually comprehensive set of languages including Pennsylvania Dutch and Trukese — reflecting attention to local community demographics. The granular record type selection and multiple submission channels (email, fax, mail) are also positive features.

## Overall Assessment

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph provides a reasonably findable but fundamentally paper-oriented ROI process that funnels all requesters — including patients seeking their own records — through a generic third-party release authorization. The form quality is adequate with logical organization and good scope controls, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and missing fee/timeline information limit patient-centeredness. The organization earns a **C grade**, reflecting an acceptable but unremarkable approach to patient record access that meets minimum requirements without demonstrating meaningful investment in the patient self-access experience.

# Rhode Island Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rhode Island Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Providence, RI, is part of the Brown University Health system (formerly Lifespan). Two PDF forms were retrieved: a system-wide "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" form (form-1, updated October 2024) and a department-specific imaging-records release form (form-2, Lifespan Medical Imaging, revised February 2023). Form-1 is the primary form relevant to a patient requesting their own records from Rhode Island Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Rhode Island Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both retrieved forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. The primary form (form-1) frames the workflow around disclosing records *to* a named recipient ("To release to:"), which is the structure of a third-party authorization — not a patient self-access request. While the form does include "Patient Request" as a purpose checkbox (Section 4), a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in their own name as both the patient and the recipient. There is no separate form, section, or process that recognizes individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 as distinct from authorized disclosure to third parties.

The hospital does maintain a dedicated medical records request webpage at `brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records` with contact information, which is a helpful navigation aid. However, this page directs patients to the same generic authorization form rather than offering a simplified patient-access workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the primary form, and a site-specific search confirmed the URL and identified the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or other access barriers were encountered. The PDF was directly downloadable from a public URL. This is a strong point — many organizations make form discovery far more difficult.

## Form Document Quality

**Fillability**: The primary form is a born-digital PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being a recently updated document (October 2024), patients must print it and complete all fields by hand. This is a missed opportunity given the form's digital origin — adding interactive fields would be trivial.

**Layout and organization**: Form-1 uses a logical 11-section numbered structure covering facility selection, recipient, dates, purpose, format, record types, exclusions, and legal terms — all compressed onto a single page. The structure is clear, but the density is high, with legal boilerplate competing for space with patient-facing fields.

**Language**: The legal sections (8–11) use standard but dense regulatory language. No plain-language summary, explanatory guidance, or patient-friendly instructions are provided. A patient without familiarity with HIPAA authorization forms would likely find the legal sections intimidating.

**Record format options**: Limited to "paper" or "CD disc" — no electronic delivery option (email, portal, secure link) is offered. This is notable for a 2024 form, especially given HIPAA's requirement to provide records in the electronic format requested if readily producible.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Broad liability waiver**: Section 9 requires patients to "release Brown University Health, its employees and my physicians from all liability arising from this disclosure of my health information." Bundling a blanket liability release into a records authorization is aggressive and may discourage patients from exercising their access rights.
- **Vague fee language**: The form notes "There may be a fee associated with this request" without specifying amounts, providing a fee schedule, or distinguishing between patient-access fees (HIPAA-capped) and third-party release fees.
- **No electronic delivery**: Offering only paper and CD in 2024 creates a barrier for patients seeking digital access.
- **Out-of-state contact numbers**: Status inquiry numbers route to Massachusetts and California area codes, suggesting outsourced ROI processing — potentially confusing for Providence-based patients.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record-type selection**: ~10 specific record categories plus a behavioral health subsection, with a helpful "Abstract" definition footnote, give patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.
- **Sensitive information protections**: Five categories of sensitive information (sexual abuse, mental health, STIs, substance use, HIV) can be excluded, respecting both 42 CFR Part 2 and Rhode Island state law.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: A single form covers all Brown University Health facilities with clear checkboxes, avoiding the need to locate separate forms.
- **Easy findability**: Forms are prominently available online with no access barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Rhode Island Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and logically organized, but it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual access rights — through a generic third-party authorization workflow. The absence of fillable fields, electronic delivery options, and a patient-access-specific pathway places it squarely in the middle of the pack. The embedded liability waiver and vague fee language are concerning, though the granular record-type options and sensitive-information protections are commendable. A patient can successfully request records, but the process was clearly designed for institutional disclosure workflows rather than patient self-service.

# MountainView Hospital (Las Vegas, NV) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MountainView Hospital is part of HCA Healthcare's Sunrise Health network in Las Vegas. The facility's own domain (`mountainview-hospital.com`) redirects to the Sunrise Health system website at `sunrisehealthinfo.com`, where all medical records information is centralized. Two PDF forms were found—an English and Spanish version of the same standardized HCA Healthcare authorization form—alongside references to two additional digital pathways: an online Swellbox records request portal and the MyHealthONE patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The medical records page at sunrisehealthinfo.com offers three pathways for patients requesting records: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (in English and Spanish), (2) an online request wizard via Swellbox, and (3) the MyHealthONE patient portal. The primary downloadable form (form-1.pdf, HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21) is a system-wide HCA Healthcare standardized authorization used across all HCA facilities, not specific to MountainView Hospital. The Swellbox portal represents the most streamlined digital option, though the PDF form remains the most prominently linked resource.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MountainView Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves both patient self-requests and third-party release, with a radio-button choice between "At the request of the individual" and "Other 3rd party recipient." While a patient *can* use this form to request their own records, the form's framing—with prominent "Recipient" fields, fax-to-provider-only restrictions, and third-party disclosure language—is clearly oriented toward release-of-information scenarios rather than individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. The form makes no distinction between Right of Access fee limits/timelines and general authorization practices.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was relatively easy. The medical records page is accessible via the main navigation ("For Patients → Medical Records"), and the authorization forms are directly linked with clear labels. The one complication was bot protection: curl requests to the initial download URL returned HTML rather than a PDF, requiring discovery of the actual CDN URL at `hcadam.com`. This is a minor technical obstacle that wouldn't affect a patient using a browser.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a single-page, fully interactive PDF with 52 fillable fields—patients can complete it digitally without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (patient/recipient info, marketing/PHI sale, signatures), with 16 specific record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. Four delivery format options are offered: paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure). The form also includes a rare USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release option, a forward-looking feature for structured data export.

However, the single-page constraint makes the layout quite dense, and some terminology (USCDI, Direct Address, NPI) is jargon that would be opaque to most patients. The language is a mix of plain language and legalese—the six "I understand that..." statements are reasonably clear, but the overall form assumes familiarity with medical records processes.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked optional but unnecessary for records authorization and a data minimization concern.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form states patients may obtain copies "for a reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts, and this language appears in a rights statement that could normalize fee collection even for Right of Access requests.
- **Fax restriction**: "(FAX only to Physician Office / Medical facility)" limits fax delivery destinations and may restrict patient choice.
- **No notarization or witness required**—a positive.
- **No in-person requirement**: Mail, fax, and online portal options are all available.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual**: Full Spanish translation (form-2.pdf) available alongside the English version—meaningful for Las Vegas's significant Spanish-speaking population, though the surrounding web pages remain English-only and some form footer elements were left untranslated.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare and forward-looking inclusion of interoperability standards on an ROI form.
- **Multiple electronic delivery choices**: Four format options with honest risk disclosures.
- **Alternative digital pathways**: Swellbox portal and MyHealthONE patient portal provide additional request channels beyond the PDF.
- **52 fillable fields**: Fully digital-first form design.

## Overall Assessment

MountainView Hospital, through HCA Healthcare's standardized forms and Sunrise Health's website, provides a reasonably accessible records request experience. The form is easy to find, technically well-built, and offers meaningful delivery format choices. The main weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway—patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization form that doesn't distinguish Right of Access rights, fee limits, or timelines. The availability of the Swellbox online portal and MyHealthONE partially compensates for this gap by offering alternative digital pathways. The form earns credit for its fillable design, Spanish availability, and USCDI awareness, but loses points for its generic framing, fee ambiguity, and unnecessary SSN collection.

# Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, a ScionHealth-affiliated for-profit community hospital in Hartsville, SC, offers two publicly available ROI forms: an English "Release of Information Authorization / Requisition Form" (form-1.pdf) and an identical Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are hosted on ScionHealth's CMS infrastructure and linked directly from the hospital's medical records page at cprmc.com/medical-records. No additional patient access forms, online portals, or digital request wizards were found. The hospital uses MRO Corp as its third-party ROI vendor for processing requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms structured around a "disclosing provider → recipient" model. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the "Name of Recipient" section with their own information — a workflow designed for third-party disclosure, not individual access. The form references 45 CFR 160 and 164 only in the context of redisclosure risk and never mentions HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524). There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no simplified self-request form, and no portal-based alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-specific web search immediately surfaced both PDF URLs, and the medical records page provides direct links alongside submission instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, or multi-click navigation was encountered. File names are descriptive (`Authorization_Update_(English).pdf`). This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — but with **zero fillable fields**. Every field must be completed by printing and handwriting. The layout is organized into two sections: Section A for patient and recipient demographics plus record type selection, and Section B for seven legal statements with a signature block. The 15-category record type checklist (face sheet, H&P, labs, imaging, etc.) with an "All Records" option provides good granularity. However, the single-page format forces dense layout with limited whitespace, and the legal statements use moderately complex language referencing CFR provisions. The form lacks instructions beyond section labels, provides no guidance on how patients will receive their records, and includes a "purpose/reason for this request" field without noting that HIPAA does not require patients to justify self-access requests.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable red flags emerge. First, Statement 6 states that patients "may need to have my physician authorize" the use or disclosure of sensitive information in their records — language that could function as an illegitimate barrier to patient access under HIPAA's Right of Access. Second, the "For Office Use Only" section includes a Social Security number field, creating unnecessary data exposure risk. The form discloses no fees, states no response timeline, and does not mention the MRO Corp third-party vendor relationship. On the positive side, no notarization is required, and submission channels include fax and email in addition to in-person delivery — adequate electronic submission options.

## Notable Strengths

The availability of a professionally translated Spanish-language form is a genuine bright spot, particularly for a community hospital. Both language versions are equally accessible from the medical records page. The granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control over their request scope. The easy online findability — direct links, descriptive URLs, no access barriers — represents a model for form availability.

## Overall Assessment

Carolina Pines provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and submit, and the Spanish translation is commendable. However, the lack of any patient self-access differentiation, zero fillable fields, concerning physician-gating language for sensitive records, and absence of fee or timeline transparency place this organization squarely in the middle tier. A patient can navigate this process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary audience.
