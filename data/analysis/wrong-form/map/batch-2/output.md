# Batch 2: The Wrong Form Problem — Access Pathway Classification

## Summary Counts (67 organizations)

| Classification | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| **Generic HIPAA authorization only** | 57 | 85% |
| **Both dedicated + generic forms** | 8 | 12% |
| **Portal-only (no facility PDF)** | 1 | 1.5% |
| **Could not determine** | 1 | 1.5% |

The dominant pattern is overwhelming: **85% of organizations funnel patients requesting their own records through a generic third-party authorization form** designed for releasing records to attorneys, insurers, and other providers.

## Organizations With Dedicated Patient Access Forms (9 total)

Eight organizations maintain **separate forms** for patient self-access alongside a third-party authorization: Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, Aurora Medical Center–Grafton, Baptist Health Lexington, Erlanger Health System, Mercy General Hospital (Dignity Health), St. Joseph's Hospital Phoenix (Dignity Health), UAB Hospital, and West Tennessee Healthcare. One organization (**AdventHealth Hendersonville**) operates portal-only with no facility-specific PDF. These organizations demonstrate that differentiation is achievable — Advocate's form-4 ("Patient Request for Health Information") opens with a portal callout and offers "Myself" as the first recipient option, while UAB's form begins: *"UAB Medicine recognizes a patient's right to access their own protected health information."* West Tennessee Healthcare's dedicated form uses "request" language (appropriate for § 164.524) rather than "authorization" language. Notably, two Dignity Health/CommonSpirit facilities (Mercy General and St. Joseph's Phoenix) each offer dedicated patient access forms, suggesting a system-level template exists but is inconsistently deployed.

## The Generic Form Mismatch: What Patients Experience

When a patient visits one of the 57 generic-only organizations to request their own records, they encounter a form built around a fundamentally wrong mental model. The core problems:

**1. "Release To" confusion.** Generic forms use a sender→recipient structure ("I authorize [Hospital] to disclose my records TO: ___"). A patient must write their own name in a field designed for a third party. Some forms offer a "Self" checkbox (A.O. Fox Hospital, Maury Regional) or instruct "(If Release is to Self, State Self)" (SSM Health), but many provide no guidance at all. At **El Centro de Corazón**, there is not even a "personal request" purpose checkbox — patients must use the write-in "Other (Specify)" option, signaling that self-access was never a design consideration.

**2. Irrelevant fields and legal frameworks.** Patients navigate recipient address/fax fields, redisclosure warnings, and expiration dates that apply to ongoing third-party authorizations but are meaningless for a one-time self-access request. At **Duly Health and Care**, patients must find a witness unless the request goes "directly to the patient" — a requirement with no HIPAA basis. **Rhode Island Hospital** bundles a blanket liability waiver into its authorization. **Adena Regional Medical Center** and **Tioga Medical Center** include witness signature lines that may deter patients without someone available to co-sign.

**3. Wrong legal basis entirely.** These are § 164.508 authorization forms. Patient self-access operates under § 164.524 (Right of Access), which requires no authorization at all. **Texas Oncology** acknowledges this on page 2 — *"This form is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual"* — but buries this critical information after the patient has already begun completing three pages of authorization fields.

**4. Fee and timeline opacity.** Generic forms rarely distinguish HIPAA's cost-based fee cap for patient access from unconstrained third-party release fees. **Saratoga Hospital** states $0.75/page with no patient-access exception. **Lincoln Hospital** cites a Washington state fee schedule ($26 base + $1.17/page) designed for third-party duplication. **Consensus Health** has effectively no functional records request infrastructure at all — the only findable form is an unbranded PatientPop template with no submission instructions.

## Patterns Worth Noting

Several generic-only organizations partially mitigate the mismatch through thoughtful design choices within the generic framework. **Merit Health Central** titles its generic form "Patient Request for Health Information" with "Myself" as the first recipient option. **UCHealth** splits its fee schedule directly on the form: free for patient access, fee-based for third parties. **Olmsted Medical Center** provides 62 fillable fields and trilingual forms (English, Spanish, Somali). These accommodations help, but the underlying form paradigm remains one of third-party disclosure rather than individual rights exercise.

System affiliation does not reliably predict differentiation. Two CommonSpirit/Dignity Health facilities offer dedicated forms while **Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital** (same system) does not. HCA Healthcare uses a single standardized generic form across **Medical City Dallas**, **Riverside Community Hospital**, and **MountainView Hospital** — technically excellent (52 fillable fields, Spanish versions) but structurally indifferent to the patient-vs-third-party distinction.

## Conclusion

In this batch, only 12% of organizations recognize that a patient requesting their own records is exercising a fundamentally different right than an attorney requesting records on behalf of a client. The remaining 85% ask patients to navigate a form designed for someone else's use case — filling in their own name as "recipient," confronting irrelevant legal warnings, and sometimes clearing barriers (witnesses, liability waivers, purpose justifications) that HIPAA does not impose on individual access requests. The wrong-form problem is not a marginal issue; it is the default experience.
