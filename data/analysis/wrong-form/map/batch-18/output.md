# Batch 18: The Wrong Form Problem — Access Pathway Classification

## Pathway Classification Summary

Of the 9 organizations analyzed in this batch:

| Classification | Count | Organizations |
|---|---|---|
| **GENERIC ONLY** | 6 | Scenic Mountain Medical Center, Springhill Medical Center, Emory University Hospital, Erie Family Health Centers, Copley Hospital, Mercy Health – Fairfield Hospital |
| **GENERIC + process-level differentiation** | 1 | MUSC Health |
| **PORTAL-PRIMARY (generic paper fallback)** | 1 | NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital |
| **NO ONLINE PATHWAY** | 1 | Neshoba General Hospital |
| **DEDICATED patient access form** | 0 | — |

**Zero** organizations in this batch offer a dedicated patient access form designed specifically for individual access under § 164.524. The dominant pattern is a generic HIPAA authorization form repurposed for all disclosure scenarios, including patient self-access.

## What Makes Generic Forms a Poor Fit

The core mismatch: HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) requires only a written request — not a signed authorization. When organizations offer only a generic authorization form, patients exercising a statutory right are forced into a framework designed for third-party release. Specific problems observed:

**Recipient confusion.** At Scenic Mountain Medical Center, Section 2 asks patients to name a "Person or Facility" as recipient. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as both requester and recipient — a conceptually awkward exercise the form provides no guidance for. Springhill Medical Center's "I hereby authorize ___ to release the following information to ___" structure creates the same self-referential puzzle. Erie Family Health Centers' form is designed for bidirectional transfers between providers, not individual access.

**Unnecessary fields and false requirements.** Copley Hospital's form includes a "Purpose of Release" field with no indication it's optional for self-access — under HIPAA, patients need not state a reason. Springhill's form collects Social Security Numbers, creating privacy risk for a transaction that doesn't require them. Several forms (Springhill, Erie, MUSC) include witness signature lines that have no HIPAA basis and could prevent a patient completing the form at home.

**Wrong legal framing.** NewYork-Presbyterian's form states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records" — accurate for third-party authorizations but misleading for patient access, where HIPAA mandates compliance with a written request regardless. MUSC's form cites § 164.524 but still funnels patients through authorization-based rules. Emory's form is titled "Authorization for the Release of Protected Health Information" — framing a patient right as a permission grant.

**Fee ambiguity.** Generic forms consistently fail to distinguish HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient access from the higher fees permissible for third-party requests. Scenic Mountain offers only "*fees may apply." Springhill and Copley disclose no fees at all. Erie references a "Pay Scale" that isn't provided. None of the generic-only forms in this batch clearly state the patient's right to cost-based pricing.

## Specific Organizational Examples

**Springhill Medical Center** exemplifies the worst case: a form unchanged since 2011 (still referencing the hospital's former name and obsolete UB-92 billing codes), requesting SSNs, bundling sensitive records without separate consent, and including a witness line — all on a non-fillable single page. A patient navigating this form receives no signal that their self-access request is legally distinct from an insurance company's.

**Emory University Hospital** shows the paradox of capable organizations using generic forms. Emory offers EHI Export as a delivery option (unusually forward-thinking), fillable fields, bilingual forms, and a Swellbox portal — yet the underlying form treats patient self-access as just another checkbox ("At my request") alongside insurer and attorney purposes.

**Neshoba General Hospital** represents the extreme: no online form at all. A patient must call or visit in person to even learn the process. Ironically, the hospital has demonstrated the technical capacity to produce fillable PDFs (an employer authorization form has 54 interactive fields), but has not applied this to patient records access.

## Partial Mitigations

Two organizations show process-level awareness despite generic forms. **MUSC Health** differentiates at the website level — MyChart for patients, authorization form for third parties — and its medical records page separates the workflows. **NewYork-Presbyterian** offers separate Verisma portal entry points for patients, representatives, and attorneys. But in both cases, the downloadable paper form remains a single generic authorization. The differentiation exists in the digital wrapper, not the document itself.

**Mercy Health – Fairfield Hospital** makes a modest accommodation: "Self" is the first checkbox in the recipient section, and the form cites § 164.524. This is the closest any generic form in this batch comes to centering patient access, though the form structure remains authorization-based.

## Batch Tally

- **Generic authorization only (no differentiation):** 6/9 (67%)
- **Generic with process-level differentiation:** 1/9 (11%)
- **Portal-primary with generic fallback:** 1/9 (11%)
- **No online pathway at all:** 1/9 (11%)
- **Dedicated patient access form:** 0/9 (0%)

The absence of any dedicated patient access form in this batch — which spans teaching hospitals, community hospitals, critical access hospitals, FQHCs, and for-profit facilities across 8 states — suggests the wrong-form problem is systemic, not limited to specific organization types or regions.
