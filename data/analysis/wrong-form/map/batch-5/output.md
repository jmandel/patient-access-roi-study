# The Wrong Form Problem — Batch 5 Analysis

## Classification Summary

Of the 190 organizations with complete data (5 of 195 lacked synthesis outputs), access pathways break down as follows:

| Category | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| **Generic HIPAA authorization only** | 132 | 69% |
| **Dedicated patient access form** | 22 | 12% |
| **Both (generic form with self-access accommodation)** | 10 | 5% |
| **Portal-only (online wizard)** | 19 | 10% |
| **No form / phone-only** | 7 | 4% |

**The dominant finding is stark: more than two-thirds of organizations hand patients a third-party release authorization when the patient simply wants their own records.** Only 12% offer a form actually designed for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

## What Makes Generic Forms a Poor Fit

A generic HIPAA authorization form is designed for one purpose: authorizing a covered entity to disclose PHI to a *third party*. When a patient requesting their own records encounters this form, several mismatches emerge:

**Wrong framing.** The form typically reads "I authorize [Provider] to disclose my records to ___" — the patient must write their own name in a field meant for an outside recipient. At Columbus Community Hospital, patients get "no guidance that this is a valid use case." At Tioga Medical Center, the "Release From/To" structure assumes inter-entity disclosure. The patient is left wondering whether they're filling the form out correctly.

**Unnecessary fields.** Generic forms require a "purpose of disclosure" (patients aren't required to justify self-access under HIPAA), a recipient address, and sometimes a witness signature. At Colquitt Regional Medical Center and Troy Regional Medical Center, witness lines may deter patients completing the form at home. At Troy, "*all* fields MUST be completed or authorization is invalid" — a blanket mandate that exceeds HIPAA requirements and creates a rejection mechanism.

**Fee confusion.** 39 red flags across generic-only orgs involve fee problems. Because these forms serve both patient access and third-party release without distinguishing between them, fee schedules often apply third-party rates (typically $0.75–$1.00/page) to patient self-access requests — potentially violating HIPAA's reasonable cost-based fee limits. Saratoga Hospital charges $0.75/page with no distinction; JPS Health Network charges a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery that likely exceeds permissible limits.

**SSN collection.** 38 red flags involve Social Security Number requests — unnecessary for records release and creating identity theft risk. DHR Health requests SSN "with no indication it is optional."

**Intimidating legal language.** Generic forms bundle liability waivers, re-disclosure warnings, and consent-conditioning language designed for inter-party transactions. Barrett Hospital's form warns that "refusal to sign may affect ability to obtain treatment or payment" — language that, applied to a patient access request via a dual-purpose form, could discourage patients from exercising their rights.

## The Score Gap

The impact is measurable. Patient-centeredness scores tell the story:

- **Dedicated forms**: 50% score 5/5, 86% score ≥ 4
- **Generic-only forms**: 0% score 5, 2% score 4, 84% score 3, **17% score 2**

Twenty-two generic-only organizations scored just 2/5 on patient-centeredness — meaning patient self-access is at best "an afterthought." No generic-only organization scored above 4, and none achieved an overall grade above B.

## Illustrative Examples

**Worst case — Mayers Memorial Hospital District**: The ROI form is an image-only scan mislabeled "Disclosure of Privacy Practices" on the website. It has no text layer (inaccessible to screen readers), no submission instructions, and patients must call the hospital to learn how to return it.

**Systemic pattern — HCA Healthcare**: Riverside Community Hospital, MountainView Hospital, TriStar Centennial, and Medical City Dallas all use the same generic HCA system-wide authorization form. The form works adequately with a "request of the individual" checkbox, but applies a single fee structure without distinguishing patient access from third-party release.

**Best-in-class contrast — Northwell Health**: Huntington Hospital and Phelps Hospital use a dedicated "Request for Access to Health Information" form citing HIPAA 45 CFR 164.524 by name, with fields designed specifically for patient self-access. Patient-centeredness score: 5/5.

## Facility Type Patterns

Generic-only forms are pervasive across all facility types: community hospitals (51), critical access hospitals (27), physician practices (21), teaching hospitals (20), and FQHCs (16). No facility type is immune, though dedicated forms appear disproportionately at major-system-affiliated hospitals where a parent organization has invested in form design (e.g., Northwell, Advocate Health, Providence, Intermountain).

## Bottom Line

The wrong-form problem is the single most common deficiency in this sample. 132 of 190 organizations — including 20 academic teaching hospitals — offer patients nothing but a third-party authorization form for exercising their individual right of access. The patient experience ranges from mild confusion (writing your own name in a "recipient" field) to genuine deterrence (witness requirements, SSN collection, liability waivers, inflated fees). The fix is straightforward: a one-page form titled "Patient Request for Access" with fields designed for self-access, citing § 164.524, with cost-based fees clearly stated. Twenty-two organizations in this sample have already done it.
