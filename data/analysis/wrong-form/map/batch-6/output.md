# Batch 6: The Wrong Form Problem — Access Pathway Classification

## Summary

Of 195 organizations in this batch, the vast majority — **151 (77%)** — offer patients only a generic third-party HIPAA authorization form when the patient wants to request their own records. Only 22 organizations (11%) provide both a dedicated patient access form and a generic authorization. A single organization (Wayne County Hospital) offers a dedicated patient access form without a separate third-party authorization. Eight organizations (4%) are portal-only, seven (4%) have no downloadable form or online process at all, and five (3%) could not be determined.

| Classification | Count | Pct |
|---|---|---|
| Generic authorization only | 151 | 77% |
| Both dedicated + generic | 22 | 11% |
| Portal only | 8 | 4% |
| No form / in-person only | 7 | 4% |
| Cannot determine | 5 | 3% |
| Dedicated patient form only | 1 | 1% |

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

When a patient exercises their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524), they are not authorizing disclosure to a third party — they are requesting their own records. Generic authorization forms conflate these two legally distinct frameworks (§ 164.508 authorization vs. § 164.524 access), creating confusion and unnecessary friction.

**The "name yourself as recipient" problem.** The most common mismatch is structural: generic forms ask "who should records be released to?" and patients must awkwardly write their own name and address. At Columbus Community Hospital, the form reads "I authorize Columbus Community Hospital to release the following information on [patient] to: [Name and Address]" — a patient must fill in their own name twice with no guidance that this is expected. Lane County Hospital's form uses the standard "I authorize [entity] to disclose… to [name]" structure, forcing patients to list themselves as both authorizer and recipient of a third-party release that isn't actually happening.

**Inappropriate legal language.** Generic authorization forms carry legal baggage designed for third-party scenarios. Troy Regional Medical Center's form requires a broad liability waiver ("discharge the facility from any and all liabilities"), a witness signature, and re-disclosure warnings — none required or appropriate when a patient requests their own records. Black River Memorial Hospital's form warns about re-disclosure risks that are legally irrelevant when the patient is the recipient.

**Wrong framing, wrong fields.** At Addabbo Family Health Center, the sole form is New York's OCA Form 960 — a litigation-focused authorization whose instructions explicitly state it was "designed for release of health information needed for litigation in New York State courts." It collects Social Security Numbers (unnecessary for self-access) and opens with six dense legal disclosures before any fillable fields. Desert Regional Medical Center's form lists "Continuation of Care" as the first/default purpose, relegating "At the request of the patient" to one checkbox among several.

**The most extreme case.** East Georgia Healthcare Center's "Medical Records Release" form is designed exclusively for *incoming* records — it hardcodes EGHC's own address as the destination. A patient trying to get records *from* EGHC would find literally no applicable form on the website.

## What Good Looks Like

The 22 organizations offering both form types demonstrate the alternative. UTMB Health maintains Form 7033 ("Patient Request for Medical Records") alongside Form 7032 (third-party authorization), with the patient form omitting irrelevant fields and adding patient-relevant features like MyChart delivery and email encryption disclosures. Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital's dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" opens with a portal callout and lists "Myself" as the first recipient option. Wayne County Hospital — the sole dedicated-only organization — titles its form "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information," centering the patient as the expected user.

## Patient Impact

A patient encountering a generic authorization form faces several concrete problems: (1) confusion about where to write their own name in a form designed for third parties, (2) unnecessary fields like "purpose of disclosure" and "relationship to patient" that don't apply, (3) intimidating legal language about re-disclosure and liability waivers that may deter them from completing the form, and (4) no information about their access rights, timelines, or fee limits under § 164.524. The form implicitly tells the patient: "You are asking us for a favor," when the law says the opposite.

The 77% generic-only rate is the single most widespread structural barrier to patient access in this study. It is not a matter of bad intent — most organizations have simply never created a form for the specific use case of a patient requesting their own records, defaulting instead to a one-size-fits-all authorization that was designed for attorneys, insurers, and other providers.
