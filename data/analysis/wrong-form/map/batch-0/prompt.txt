You are investigating a specific problem in healthcare record access: organizations
that offer patients a generic third-party authorization form when the patient actually wants
to request their OWN records under HIPAA's Right of Access.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata.

Your task: for each org in this batch, classify its access pathway:
- Does it offer a DEDICATED patient access form (designed for individual access under § 164.524)?
- Does it only offer a GENERIC HIPAA authorization form (designed for third-party release)?
- Does it offer BOTH (separate forms for each purpose)?
- Is it PORTAL-ONLY (no downloadable form)?
- Could you NOT DETERMINE from the available materials?

For orgs using only a generic form: what specifically makes it a poor fit for patient
self-access? What would a patient experience — confusion, extra fields, wrong framing?

Tally counts. Cite specific examples of the mismatch problem.

# Cone Health — Organizational Synthesis

## Overview

Cone Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Greensboro, NC, operating multiple hospitals and the Cone Health Medical Group (CHMG) physician practices. Four documents were found related to medical records requests: a primary English HIPAA Authorization form (form-1), its Spanish translation (form-2), a Request for Amendment form (form-3, not an ROI form), and a separate CHMG-specific ROI form (form-4) discovered only through web search. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a generic HIPAA authorization downloaded from the Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Differentiation

Cone Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "HIPAA Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-requests and third-party releases. The only differentiation is a checkbox in the Purpose section: "☐ Patient Request ☐ Legal ☐ Other." A patient requesting their own records must still complete recipient fields (name, address, fax, email) designed for third-party disclosures — effectively naming themselves as the recipient of their own information. The form never references the HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or frames the interaction as a patient exercising a legal right. Adding to the confusion, CHMG patients need a separate form (form-4) that isn't linked from the main website, and no guidance explains which form applies to which patient.

## Retrieval Experience

The primary form was **easy to find** — it is linked directly from a well-organized Medical Records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records/`. However, the site employs bot protection that blocks standard HTTP requests, requiring browser-like headers or a real browser for downloads. The CHMG form (form-4) was only discoverable via web search, not through website navigation — a notable findability gap for medical group patients.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields despite being a digitally-produced document (not a scan). All 20+ fields must be completed by hand after printing. This is especially notable because the CHMG form (form-4) includes 42 fillable fields, demonstrating the organization has the capability. The form is organized into 6 numbered sections with a clear logical flow (patient identification → recipient → purpose → facility → date range → information type → delivery method → rights/signature). However, the language is heavily administrative/legal: the Patient Rights section consists of 8 dense paragraphs, and information-type checkboxes use clinical terminology ("History and Physical," "Consultation Reports," "Operative Notes") that most patients would not understand.

The form offers 6 delivery methods including email — a bright spot. But critically, the form provides **no submission instructions** — no address, fax number, email, or guidance on where to send the completed authorization. The only address appears in the revocation clause. A patient must independently determine how to submit.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee charge for reproduction of medical records" with no amounts or reference to HIPAA fee limits. The form bundles authorization for all sensitive categories (reproductive health, mental health, STDs, genetic testing, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS) with no opt-out mechanism — a patient requesting a simple lab result must authorize disclosure of all sensitive information. The "Office Use Only" section requiring a Driver's License number implies in-person identity verification may be expected. The CHMG form compounds these issues with an embedded liability waiver ("hereby released from any legal responsibility or liability") that is not standard HIPAA language and may chill patient access rights.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** (form-2), professionally translated and linked alongside the English version
- **Email delivery option** offered with transparent security disclaimer
- **Granular record-type selection** with 18+ checkboxes including behavioral health subcategories
- **Recently updated** (December 2024), suggesting active form maintenance
- **Amendment form published** alongside ROI forms, appropriately serving the related HIPAA right

## Overall Assessment

Cone Health provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form that was designed primarily for third-party disclosures, with no dedicated pathway for individual access. The primary form's lack of fillable fields, absent submission instructions, bundled sensitive-category consent, and split between hospital and CHMG forms create a process that works but requires persistence and guesswork from patients. The Spanish translation and email delivery option are genuine bright spots, but they don't compensate for the fundamental design choices that make this a C-level experience.

# Copley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Copley Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Morrisville, Vermont. The hospital offers a single Release of Information form — titled "Patient Request for Health Information Authorization Form" (Form 1085, dated 07-21) — that serves as the primary pathway for patients seeking their own health records. No patient portal–based request option or online submission wizard was identified; the form is a downloadable PDF linked from the hospital's Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Copley's form is a **dual-purpose authorization** that handles both patient self-access and third-party release on a single page. The form includes a clear checkbox for "Provide a copy of my records to: Me," which meaningfully distinguishes the patient self-access use case — but it does not separate this pathway from third-party release. A patient requesting their own records encounters fields irrelevant to their situation, such as "Release my Records TO:" (with recipient name, address, fax, and phone fields) and "Purpose of Release." Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not state a purpose for requesting their own records, so the presence of this field — without clarification that it's optional for self-requests — could confuse or deter patients.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the phrase "Right of Access." While the authorization language (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure warning) is well-written, the form frames the interaction as an *authorization* rather than an *access right*, which is a conceptual distinction that matters for patient-centeredness.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Copley Hospital's release of information form immediately surfaced a direct link to the PDF. The form is also prominently linked from the Medical Records page under "For Patients + Visitors" in the main site navigation. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was required. The hospital's Medical Records page also links to three related HIPAA forms (amendment request, alternate communication, PHI restrictions), which shows a thoughtful information architecture even if the ROI form itself is the only one relevant to record requests.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page PDF** — impressively compact — with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → delivery/format options → authorization scope → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. The language is largely plain and accessible, with standout phrasing like "My treatment will not be impacted, no matter if I sign this Authorization or not."

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). This means patients must print and hand-fill the form, then fax or mail it back. The delivery and format options are notably strong — in-person pickup, mail, fax, and patient portal for delivery, plus paper copy or electronic copy (email, USB, CD, portal) for format — and the form helpfully notes that "Many documents that you may be requesting are available to you in your patient portal." But the submission process itself requires either fax (802-888-8361) or mail to the HIM department.

## Barriers & Compliance

**No notarization or witness** is required. Representative signers must attach proof of authority, which is a reasonable requirement. The authorization is valid for one year with clear revocation instructions including both mailing and fax addresses.

**Fees are not mentioned** anywhere on the form, leaving patients unable to anticipate costs. This is a notable gap — HIPAA requires transparency about fees for patient access requests.

The form is dated July 2021 and predates the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective April 2023), suggesting it may not reflect current requirements around electronic health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- **Comprehensive delivery and format options** — email, USB, CD, patient portal, fax, mail, and in-person pickup
- **Single-page efficiency** — all necessary content on one page
- **Clear voluntariness statement** in plain language
- **Easy findability** — prominent placement and search-engine accessible

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** — forces a paper workflow despite digital authorship
- **No fee disclosure** — patients cannot anticipate costs
- **"Purpose of Release" field** not flagged as optional for self-requests
- **No explicit Right of Access framing** — treated as authorization rather than access right
- **Form staleness** — over 4 years old, predating information blocking rules

## Overall Assessment

Copley Hospital provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience anchored by easy findability, a compact single-page form, plain language, and strong delivery/format options. The dual-purpose design accommodates patient self-access but doesn't optimize for it. The primary weaknesses — lack of fillable fields and absence of fee disclosure — represent missed opportunities rather than active barriers. Fax submission is available, providing an adequate electronic pathway. For a small critical access hospital, this is a competent if imperfect effort that would benefit from modernization: adding fillable fields, separating or clearly labeling the self-access pathway, and disclosing fee information.

# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Medical Center (CMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Toms River, NJ, part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also offers a Ciox/Swellbox online records request portal as the primary pathway for patients.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF documents were downloaded:

- **form-1.pdf** — A CMC-specific one-page "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility" (2017, image-only scan, no fillable fields). This is the legacy facility-level outbound release form.
- **form-2.pdf** — A one-page "Request for Release of Health Information *to* CMC" (2015/2021, image-only scan). This is an inbound records transfer form and is **not relevant** for a patient requesting their own records.
- **form-3.pdf** — The system-wide RWJBH "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (3 pages, Nov 2025, has text layer but no fillable fields). This is the most current and comprehensive form, covering all RWJBH locations. It is the best available PDF for patient self-access.

Beyond PDF forms, the medical records page prominently features a **Ciox/Swellbox online portal** for electronic records requests. Fax (732-557-2209) and email (cmcroimedicalrecords@rwjbh.org) submission options are also available.

## Patient Access Pathway

CMC does not offer a dedicated form specifically designed for patient self-access. Both the legacy CMC form (form-1) and the system-wide form (form-3) are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient access, third-party requests, insurance, legal, and continuing care. On form-3, "Personal" appears as a purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care/Treatment," "Insurance," and "Legal," but the patient must name themselves as the recipient in a field clearly designed for third-party organizations. The Swellbox online portal, however, may provide a more patient-centric experience as a purpose-built records request tool, and the organization directs patients toward it as the primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was straightforward. A direct web search for CMC medical records authorization returned the facility's medical records page immediately. The page links to the CMC-specific forms and references the online portal. The system-wide form (form-3) required a separate search at the RWJBH system level. No bot blocking or authentication barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing form-3 (the best available PDF): the document has a text layer and clean digital rendering (created in Word, not scanned), but **lacks fillable fields** — a patient must print it and complete it by hand. The layout is well-organized with a logical flow: patient demographics → facility selection → recipient → delivery method → record types → purpose → legal terms → signature. Record type selection is granular (15+ checkboxes including behavioral health, pathology, and imaging). Page 3 provides a helpful contact directory for all RWJBH facility HIM departments. Legal text on page 2 is dense but not impenetrably so. The facility checkbox grid on page 1 is visually crowded but functional. The older CMC-specific forms (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans with zero accessibility — no text layer, no fillable fields, no screen reader support.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-3 includes anti-conditioning language ("my refusal will not affect the start, continuation or quality of my medical treatment") and clear revocation rights. No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is **vague**: records are free when sent to another provider for care, but "there may be a fee" for other requests with no schedule or amounts provided. HIPAA cost-based fee limits for patient access are not mentioned. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The 180-day authorization expiration is reasonable.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods** on form-3: paper pickup, US Mail, encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format" — far better than most ROI forms.
- **Online portal** (Swellbox) provides a fully digital pathway alongside PDF forms.
- **Comprehensive contact directory** (page 3) with phone and fax for every RWJBH HIM department.
- **Multiple submission channels**: fax, email, online portal, and mail.

## Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any PDF form despite digital creation.
- **Generic authorization form** — no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow.
- **Opaque fee disclosure** — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.
- **Legacy CMC forms** (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans that remain linked on the website alongside the modern system-wide form, creating potential confusion.

## Overall Assessment

Community Medical Center earns a **B** overall. The organization benefits significantly from the Swellbox online portal and strong delivery method options on the system-wide form. The retrieval experience is easy and multiple submission channels exist. However, the PDF forms are non-fillable and generic, the fee disclosure is vague, and there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow. The coexistence of legacy image-only scans alongside a modern system-wide form reflects incomplete digital modernization.

# Owensboro Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Owensboro Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Owensboro, Kentucky, operating three hospitals (Regional Hospital, Muhlenberg Community Hospital, and Twin Lakes Medical Center) plus a medical group. The organization provides a single, system-wide "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Health Information" form (form-1) accompanied by a dedicated plain-language instruction sheet (form-2). Both documents are easily accessible online.

## Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved, both directly downloadable PDFs:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary ROI authorization form (2 pages). This is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Patients check "Me" as recipient and "Patient Request" as purpose to request their own records.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A companion instruction document (2 pages) explaining each section of the form in plain language, with submission addresses, fax numbers, and an email address.

Submission options include mail, fax, and email (himroi@owensborohealth.org for the main hospital), providing adequate electronic submission pathways. MyChart is also referenced as both a format and delivery option, indicating a patient portal pathway exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Owensboro Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves all purposes — patient requests, legal/attorney, insurance, and third-party release. However, the form does clearly accommodate patient self-access: "Me" is a prominently positioned recipient checkbox, "Patient Request" is a reason option, and the instruction document is written from the patient's perspective ("If you are wanting to receive your records check the box labeled 'Me'"). The dual-purpose design means patients must navigate fields intended for third-party release (recipient address, legal representative sections) and understand which parts apply to them, but the instruction sheet mitigates this confusion substantially.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. A simple web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's medical records page also surfaces both documents. No login walls, bot blocking, or CAPTCHAs were encountered. This earns a top findability score.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form has a proper text layer but **zero fillable fields** — all data entry areas are underscored blank lines and non-interactive checkboxes. This is a print-and-fill document. A patient must print, handwrite, and then fax, mail, or email a scan. The layout is logically organized across 2 pages with clear section headers and a reasonable field count (~15-18 fields). Language is a mix of plain English and necessary legal terminology; the companion instruction document compensates by restating everything in plain language.

The form offers an unusually comprehensive set of format options (Paper, MyChart, EHI Export, Email, Fax, CD, USB) and delivery methods (Mail, Pickup, Fax, MyChart, encrypted email, unencrypted email with risk warning). The explicit inclusion of **EHI Export** with a detailed explanation — covering all ePHI across the organization and named Community Connect Partners, delivered in TSV format — is rare and exemplary.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Multiple submission channels (mail, fax, email) are available. No fees are mentioned on the form or instructions, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs but not actively deterred. The 120-day authorization expiration is appropriate for third-party releases but is technically unnecessary for patient self-access under HIPAA § 164.524, which grants an ongoing right. The "Your Rights" section covers voluntariness, right to revoke, right to inspect, and re-disclosure risk — a solid rights statement.

## Notable Strengths

- **EHI Export option**: Explicitly offered with named partner organizations and format details — well ahead of industry norms.
- **Companion instruction document**: A dedicated 2-page plain-language guide is an uncommon and patient-friendly practice.
- **Comprehensive delivery options**: Seven format choices and six delivery methods, including encrypted/unencrypted email with clear risk disclosure.
- **Help phone number**: The instruction document closes with a direct number for assistance.

## Weaknesses

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields despite having a digital text layer — a missed opportunity for a fully digital workflow.
- **No pathway differentiation**: Patient self-access is routed through the same authorization form as third-party releases.
- **No fee transparency**: Neither document mentions whether fees apply to patient access requests.
- **120-day expiration**: Applied broadly, including to patient self-access requests where it is legally unnecessary.

## Overall Assessment

Owensboro Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its comprehensive format/delivery options, EHI Export transparency, and companion instruction document. The main limitations are the non-fillable PDF format and the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization. For a community hospital system, this is a well-above-average effort that could reach excellence with fillable form fields and a patient-specific access process.

# Hendrick Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hendrick Health, a nonprofit regional hospital system based in Abilene, TX, provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records requests — one for the hospital arm (Hendrick Medical Center, including South and Brownwood campuses) and one for the outpatient clinic arm (Hendrick Clinic). Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information, not dedicated patient self-access request forms. No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Hendrick Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting disclosure. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information (PHI)" and frame the transaction as a release between two named parties. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name in the "authorize" blank and again in the "who can receive" section — a workflow designed for attorneys, insurers, and other requestors, not for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The forms do include "Personal Use" as one of seven disclosure reasons, which accommodates patient self-access, but it is not highlighted or explained. There is no mention of the patient's Right of Access, no fee limitation language, and no stated response timeline.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Standard web searches immediately surfaced the Medical Records page (hendrickhealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/), which links directly to both PDFs with clear descriptions. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, login wall, or browser automation was required. The URLs are descriptive and stable. This is a findability bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1 (hospital)** is the stronger of the two forms and represents the best available pathway. It is a single-page flat PDF (zero fillable fields) with a text layer — digitally created from a Word document but exported without interactive form fields. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit via fax (325-670-6538), mail, email, or in-person pickup. The Hendrick Service Center address and contact information are pre-populated, reducing patient guesswork.

The form is organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → sensitive record initials → reason for disclosure → legal text → party identification → signatures. Record type granularity is a strength, with 16+ specific checkboxes plus an "all health information" option. However, the legal text in the lower third is dense, small-font legalese citing Texas Health & Safety Code § 181.154(c) and 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(1). No plain-language summary of patient rights is provided.

**Form-2 (clinic)** is structurally identical but notably weaker: it omits the email delivery option, lacks pre-filled contact information (leaving patients unsure where to submit), and omits a dates-of-service field. Patients who received care at both hospital and clinic entities would need to complete two separate forms with no cross-referencing guidance.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization, witness, or in-person submission is required — these are positive absences. Fees are not mentioned at all (neither disclosed nor waived). The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is unnecessary for HIPAA-compliant record identification but is a minor rather than severe barrier.

Both forms misspell "HIPAA" as "HIPPA" — a factual error that appears in the opening paragraph and undermines credibility. Form-2's PDF metadata exposes internal document management details ("Page 2__05.2022 MASTER-Authorization to Obtain or Release PHI- - Copy.docx"), suggesting careless export. The title of form-1 ("Authorization to Release Health Information") contradicts its subtitle ("Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information"), creating directional confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery** on the hospital form is uncommon and provides a digital delivery pathway
- **Pre-populated facility contact information** on form-1 reduces patient burden
- **Granular record selection** gives patients meaningful control over what is released
- **Single-page format** keeps the form manageable despite dense content

## Overall Assessment

Hendrick Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find and free of major barriers, but the organization channels all requestors — patients, attorneys, insurers — through the same generic authorization form without acknowledging that patient self-access is a distinct right with different rules. The flat, non-fillable PDFs represent a missed opportunity for digital-first design, and the split between hospital and clinic forms adds unnecessary complexity. A patient can get their records here without undue hardship, but the process was clearly not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Mayers Memorial Hospital District — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were found for Mayers Memorial Hospital District, a government-owned critical access hospital in Fall River Mills, California:

1. **form-2.pdf** — A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" branded with the hospital's name, adapted from the California Hospital Association template (CHA 16-1, March 2013). This is hosted directly on the hospital website but critically mislabeled as "Disclosure of Privacy Practices" in the site navigation. It is the hospital's primary ROI authorization form (form number MMH 470).

2. **form-1.pdf** — A 1-page generic, unbranded "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It was found only through web search and is not linked from any page on the hospital website.

For a patient requesting their own records, **form-2.pdf is the most relevant** — it is the branded hospital form, includes a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose, and contains a substantive "My Rights" section. However, both forms are fundamentally structured as third-party release authorizations.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mayers Memorial does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms require patients to fill in a recipient's name and address, meaning a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own contact information as the "recipient." Form-2 partially acknowledges patient self-access through a "Patient request" checkbox, but the workflow remains identical to a third-party release. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding a usable form was **difficult**. The hospital's Medical Records page provides only department hours and a phone number — no downloadable form, no request instructions. The branded form (form-2) is linked from the Patients & Visitors page under the misleading label "Disclosure of Privacy Practices," a title that describes an entirely different type of document. A patient looking for a records release form would likely skip this link. The generic form-1 is only discoverable through external web search leading to a third-party CDN URL.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-2** (the primary form) is an **image-only scan** with no text layer and no fillable fields. It cannot be searched, copied from, or read by screen readers — a significant accessibility failure. Despite the poor digital format, its content is reasonably well-structured: clear section headers, checkboxes for record scope (all records vs. specific types), granular sensitive-information checkboxes (mental health, HIV, substance abuse) each requiring initials, and a "My Rights" section written in plain first-person language. Estimated field count is approximately 15 fields across 2 pages.

**Form-1** has a text layer (digitally created) but also lacks fillable fields and is far less complete — no checkboxes, no scope options, no rights statement, and no HIPAA-required authorization elements (expiration, revocation).

Neither form provides any submission instructions — no fax number, mailing address, email, or portal link. A patient who completes the form has no documented path to submit it without calling the hospital.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions on either form**: The most critical barrier — patients cannot determine how to return a completed form.
- **Image-only scan** (form-2): Completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.
- **Intimidating opening language** (form-2): "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — potentially chilling for patients who lack details like their MRN.
- **Mislabeled web link**: The form is hidden behind an incorrect label, making it effectively unfindable through normal navigation.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form addresses whether fees will be charged.

## Bright Spots

- The "My Rights" section on form-2 is genuinely well-written in plain first-person language, clearly stating patients' rights to refuse, inspect records, and revoke authorization.
- Sensitive information handling is properly separated with individual checkboxes and initial lines, compliant with California law and 42 CFR Part 2.
- Use of the CHA template ensures baseline legal compliance with California health privacy requirements.

## Overall Assessment

Mayers Memorial provides a below-average patient experience for records access. While the branded form has decent content design rooted in its CHA template, the combination of extremely poor findability, an image-only scan format, absent submission instructions, and no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release creates a frustrating and largely inaccessible process. A patient attempting to request their own records online would struggle at every step — finding the form, reading it with assistive technology, understanding how to complete it for self-access, and figuring out where to submit it.

# Proliance Surgeons — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Proliance Surgeons is a large, independent, for-profit physician practice group based in Seattle, WA, comprising multiple member practices (ProOrtho, Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, Northwest Physicians Specialists/MRI, Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons, and others). Four documents were retrieved: two nearly identical outgoing ROI authorization forms (form-2 from the main site, form-4 from ProOrtho), an image-only scan of a similar form (form-1 from NPS/MRI), and an incoming records transfer form (form-3 from Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons). The main medical records page also references Datavant as an online ROI partner, though the portal was not evaluated directly.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Proliance Surgeons does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. All outgoing ROI forms (form-1, form-2, form-4) use the same generic HIPAA authorization template ("Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information"), which is designed for third-party disclosure under § 164.508. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address as the "recipient" — an awkward workflow that conflates patient access rights (§ 164.524) with third-party authorization. The form does include an "at my request" reason checkbox, but the structure assumes disclosure to an external party. There is no mention of HIPAA Right of Access, no format/delivery preference field, and no reference to timelines or fee limitations specific to individual access.

The mention of Datavant on the medical records page suggests an online portal option exists, which would provide a more streamlined pathway, but the PDF forms themselves are the only downloadable option found.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A basic web search immediately surfaced multiple PDFs, and the main Proliance medical records page (proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links directly to the primary form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The main challenge is fragmentation: different member practices host their own versions of the same template, and a patient arriving at a subsidiary site (npsmri.com, proortho.com) may find a different version than the canonical one on the main site, with no cross-referencing between versions.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf** (ProOrtho), which is textually identical to form-2 but was noted to have interactive checkboxes (though metadata reports 0 AcroForm fields, suggesting non-standard implementation). Both are single-page, cleanly structured documents with two clear sections: "I. My Authorization" and "II. My Rights." The language is relatively plain, written in first person ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), and the layout is logical. Scope options are well-granulated (all records, condition-specific, date-specific, plus sensitive categories requiring explicit opt-in per Washington State law). However, neither form has true fillable text fields — patients must print and handwrite all entries. Form-2 includes a practice-specific fax number (425.820.8975) for submission; form-4 lacks any submission instructions entirely.

Form-1 is an image-only scan at 150 DPI with no text layer — completely inaccessible to screen readers and unsearchable. It represents the worst-case scenario a patient might encounter if they land on the NPS/MRI subsidiary site.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness requirement** — a positive.
- **No fees disclosed** — neutral; avoids deterrence but leaves patients uninformed.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax submission is available via form-2.
- **No electronic signature option** — requires printing and wet signature.
- **No response time stated** — patients have no expectation for turnaround.
- **Practice-specific contact info** baked into one form variant, creating confusion for patients at other Proliance locations.

## Notable Strengths

- **Concise one-page format** that covers all essential authorization elements without clutter.
- **Sensitive information categories** properly separated with individual opt-in checkboxes (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), compliant with Washington State RCW 70.02.
- **First-person rights language** in the "My Rights" section, which is more patient-friendly than typical third-person legal boilerplate.
- **Clear revocation instructions** with two specific methods (revocation form or letter).
- **Datavant portal mentioned** on the medical records page as an online alternative.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **Generic authorization form conflated with patient access** — no dedicated Right of Access pathway.
- **No fillable text fields** — print-and-handwrite workflow despite being a digitally-created document.
- **Fragmentation across subsidiaries** — multiple versions with inconsistent quality and no cross-referencing.
- **Form-1 is an image-only scan** — a digital accessibility failure.
- **Form-3 cites wrong state law** (California CMIA instead of Washington RCW 70.02) and wrong HIPAA year (2003 vs. 1996).

## Overall Assessment

Proliance Surgeons provides a readily findable, concise authorization form with reasonable content design and no major procedural barriers. However, the organization falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all record requests through a generic third-party authorization form with no differentiation for individual access. The print-and-handwrite workflow and subsidiary fragmentation further diminish the experience. The mention of Datavant as an online option is promising but not reflected in the downloadable forms themselves. Overall grade: **C** — adequate but not designed around patient self-access.

# Arizona Community Physicians — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Arizona Community Physicians (ACP) is an independent, for-profit physician practice group in Tucson, Arizona. The organization maintains a well-organized patient forms page at azacp.com/forms/ with seven downloadable PDFs covering general records release, practice-specific release, imaging-specific release, adult/minor access designation, a Spanish minor access form, and a HIPAA amendment request. Critically, ACP also offers an online electronic records self-request wizard through Swellbox (swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html), providing a modern digital pathway alongside the paper forms.

## Relevant Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1.pdf** — the general "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (Form 100, revised 08/26/2024). However, ACP also provides the **Swellbox online wizard**, which is the superior pathway for a patient who wants to submit a request electronically without printing, hand-filling, and physically delivering a paper form. The forms page links to both options, giving patients a choice.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

ACP does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release, with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields that frame the transaction as a provider-to-provider or provider-to-entity transfer. The "TO" field is labeled "Name of Physician/Organization," implying the recipient should be another provider rather than the patient. A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name and address in that field, but the form provides no guidance for this use case. The purpose checkboxes include "At request of Patient," which at least acknowledges patient-initiated requests, but the form structure does not differentiate the legal framework (HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524 vs. authorization under § 164.508).

The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, may offer a more patient-centric experience as an electronic self-request tool, though its exact workflow was not evaluated as a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding ACP's forms was **easy**. The Patient Forms page is linked from the main website navigation, and multiple search strategies (web search, site-specific search, direct navigation) all returned direct PDF URLs. No login, bot blocking, or browser fallback was needed. The forms page is clearly organized and lists all seven documents. The Swellbox wizard link is also present on the forms page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF** with a native text layer. Despite being revised in August 2024, it has zero fillable fields — all blanks are underscore placeholders requiring printing and handwriting. The layout is clean and logically organized with capitalized section headers (PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM/TO, PURPOSE, TYPE OF INFORMATION). The language is generally plain and accessible, though the fee disclosure is confusingly placed as a footnote under the "Other" purpose checkbox rather than in its own section. The form collects a reasonable set of fields (~12-15 blanks) without requesting a Social Security Number — a positive privacy practice. It includes a "Former Name" field, which is a thoughtful inclusion.

The form offers three delivery format options (paper, disc/PDF, email), though email is restricted to "medical records processed by CIOX" without explaining what that means. The two-tier record type structure appropriately separates general records from protected records (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse) with distinct consent checkboxes.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness requirements.** Fees are disclosed at $0.07/page and $6.50/disc — both modest and within HIPAA limits — though "additional charges for shipping and handling" are mentioned without quantification. The one-year authorization expiration is standard. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated.

The most significant barrier is the **absence of submission instructions** on form-1 itself — no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal URL. A patient who downloads and prints the form has no idea where to send it. This is a functional defect. By contrast, form-7 (amendment request) includes explicit mail, fax, and in-person delivery instructions. The Swellbox wizard partially mitigates this by offering an entirely separate electronic pathway, but form-1 doesn't reference it.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox electronic self-request wizard** provides a modern digital alternative to the paper form ecosystem
- **Comprehensive form suite** — seven distinct documents covering diverse patient needs, including imaging-specific and amendment request forms
- **Spanish-language minor access form** (form-6) demonstrates language access awareness appropriate for Tucson's ~42% Hispanic population
- **No SSN collection** on the primary ROI form
- **Protected records separation** with distinct checkboxes for HIV, behavioral health, and substance abuse
- **HIPAA amendment request form** published online — uncommon among practices

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient self-access form** — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization
- **No fillable fields on any form** — all seven PDFs are flat, print-and-fill documents
- **No Spanish version of the primary ROI form** (form-1), despite Spanish availability for the minor access form
- **Missing submission instructions** on the primary ROI form
- **Fee disclosure placement** is confusing (buried under "Other" purpose checkbox)
- **1-year default records limitation** may surprise patients seeking complete history

## Overall Assessment

ACP demonstrates above-average organizational effort in making patient forms accessible online, with a well-organized forms page, a comprehensive suite of documents, and — crucially — a Swellbox electronic self-request option that elevates the patient experience beyond the paper-form baseline. However, the primary ROI form itself is a generic third-party authorization that doesn't distinguish patient self-access, lacks fillable fields, and omits submission instructions. The availability of the Swellbox pathway is the key differentiator that lifts ACP's overall assessment, though the paper form ecosystem could benefit from modernization and better patient-access-specific design.

# Myrtue Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Myrtue Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Harlan, Iowa. The organization posts its medical records forms on a dedicated "Authorization + Release Forms" page under the Patients + Visitors section of its website. Two English-language forms were retrieved, along with references to their Spanish translations:

- **form-1.pdf** — "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (the primary ROI form)
- **form-2.pdf** — "Consent for Disclosure" (permission for verbal communication with designated individuals)

Form-1 is the document a patient would use to request copies of their own medical records. Form-2 serves a different purpose — authorizing the facility to discuss a patient's care by phone with family members or caregivers — and is not relevant to the patient self-access use case.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

Myrtue Medical Center does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party seeking authorization for release. Form-1 is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form with a bidirectional "From / To" layout. A patient requesting their own records must check Myrtue in the "From" column and write their own name and address in the "To" column's "Other" field. This works, but the form was clearly designed with third-party release as the primary use case — there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no streamlined self-request pathway, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A site-scoped web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's website provides a clearly labeled forms page reachable within two clicks from the homepage. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or login requirements were encountered. The PDF filenames are descriptive and include language and revision date. The form header includes complete HIM department contact information (phone, fax, and email), giving patients clear channels for questions and submission.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally designed PDF — concise and logically organized with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, from/to routing, record type selection, purpose, delivery method, legal disclosures, and signature. The language is mostly plain, with formal phrasing limited to the legal disclosures at the bottom. Record type options are granular, with appropriate handling of substance use disorder records under 42 CFR Part 2.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being designed in publishing software with 10 fonts and an embedded logo. All checkboxes and text blanks are static graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a missed opportunity — the June 2025 revision could have added interactive form elements with minimal effort.

## Submission and Delivery Options

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: MyChart Portal, mail, encrypted email, and in-person pickup. The inclusion of MyChart Portal and encrypted email is a genuine bright spot for a small rural facility. For form submission, the header lists fax (712-755-2640) and email (medicalrecords@myrtuemedical.org), meaning a patient can submit the completed form electronically. This meets the baseline for adequate electronic access.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required — only the patient or authorized representative signature. Fees are disclosed as subject to "reproduction fees in accordance with federal/state regulations," but no specific amounts are provided, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. The form includes required HIPAA authorization disclosures: right to revoke, no-conditioning statement, re-disclosure warning, and a one-year maximum expiration. However, because the form frames patient access as a § 164.508 authorization rather than a § 164.524 access request, patients may not understand that different fee rules and timelines apply to their own records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish translations available** for both forms — commendable for a small rural Iowa facility
- **MyChart Portal and encrypted email** as delivery options signal a digital-forward approach
- **Substance use disorder carve-out** with 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language reflects careful compliance
- **Recent revision** (June 2025) suggests active form maintenance
- **Single-page design** minimizes patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Myrtue Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with some genuinely progressive features (portal delivery, encrypted email, bilingual availability). However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing place it squarely in the middle tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Montefiore Nyack Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Montefiore Nyack Hospital (part of Montefiore Health System) publishes a single "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available in two versions. The current version (form-1.pdf, Rev. 01/2022) is a 3-page fillable PDF linked from the hospital's [Medical Records page](https://www.montefiorenyack.org/manage-my-care/medical-records). An older version (form-2.pdf, Rev. 10/2021) remains accessible at its original URL but is no longer linked from the website. Both forms are facility-branded rather than system-wide Montefiore Health System forms.

The hospital provides three submission channels: fax (845-348-8433), email (ROI@montefiorenyack.org), and phone (845-348-2527), with a physical mailing address also listed. Electronic delivery of records via email is explicitly offered — a notable positive.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Montefiore Nyack does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA release serving patients, attorneys, and "other individuals/companies" as parallel options under a single "RELEASE THE REQUESTED RECORDS TO" section. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or any framing that acknowledges patients have a legal right to their records. The transaction is characterized entirely as an "authorization to release" — a third-party authorization framework applied to patient self-access. A patient can select "PATIENT" as the recipient, but must navigate a form that equally serves attorneys and other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL, and the form is one click from the Medical Records page. The only friction was technical: the site's CDN/WAF blocks automated downloads (curl requests return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. This bot-blocking is likely unintentional but could affect patients using download managers or assistive tools.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a meaningful improvement over its predecessor. It includes 39 interactive fillable fields, allowing patients to complete it digitally rather than printing and handwriting. The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient designation → record type selection → sensitive information consent → legal disclosures → signature → contact information. Section headers are bold and labeled, and record type checkboxes (ER, inpatient, outpatient, images, billing) offer useful granularity.

However, several quality issues undercut the form. All 39 fillable fields lack accessible names, creating a significant screen-reader accessibility gap. The form has inflated to 3 pages and 353 KB (with 210 embedded images) compared to the older single-page version covering identical content in 70 KB. The revocation paragraph contains a grammatical error ("affect" instead of "effect") and switches between first and second person mid-sentence, suggesting poorly merged source text. Despite a header instructing patients to "SPECIFY THE DATES OF SERVICE," no field exists for entering dates. The distinction between an "abstract" and a full medical record is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to request the full record.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no witness signature, no in-person submission requirement. Fees are not mentioned at all — neither disclosed nor waived. Revocation rights and re-disclosure warnings are clearly stated. Sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug, mental health, HIV) are appropriately separated per New York State law. The electronic delivery option requires a somewhat confusing two-step process (provide email on the form and send a confirmation email to ROI@montefiorenyack.org), adding unnecessary friction.

## Overall Assessment

Montefiore Nyack Hospital provides a functional, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process. The fillable PDF, multiple submission channels, and electronic delivery option are genuine strengths that place it above many peers. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — funneling self-access requests through a generic third-party authorization form — is the most significant gap. The form's technical quality is further diminished by unnamed fillable fields, grammatical errors, and confusing instructions around dates of service and electronic delivery. The hospital earns a solid **B grade**: accessible and usable, but not designed around the patient self-access use case.

# Fenway Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fenway Health, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Boston, MA, provides a cohesive three-document records-release package: an English ROI authorization form (form-1), a companion FAQ guide (form-2), and a Spanish translation of the ROI form (form-3). The forms are easy to find, submission channels are plentiful, and the organization demonstrates genuine care for its patient population through thoughtful design choices — but it does not offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway, instead routing all records requests through a generic third-party authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

The primary form is titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" and is structured around a FROM/TO model: "I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM: Sender/Facility's name... TO: Recipient/Facility's name." This framing is designed for provider-to-provider transfers — a patient wanting their own records must write their personal name and address into the "Recipient/Facility's name" field, which is unintuitive. There is no checkbox for "send records to me" and no separate patient access form. The organization does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization.

Fenway Health also offers MyChart patient portal access, which provides a separate digital pathway, but the downloadable form itself is firmly a generic authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Fenway Health's forms was straightforward — a simple web search immediately returned the PDF URL and the dedicated medical records page at fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was needed. The organization maintains a clean, dedicated medical records landing page with clear submission instructions. This is a best-case retrieval scenario.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a clean text layer and 7 fonts — clearly designed with care in a layout tool. However, it contains zero fillable fields, which is a significant missed opportunity. Despite being digitally created, patients must print, hand-fill, and then scan or fax the form. The layout follows a logical 7-section flow (patient info → sender → recipient → reason → record type → sensitive info → signature) and fits on one page, though the density is notable. The legal notice in Section 7 is a single 130-word block mixing authorization scope, revocation rights, reproductive health protections, and substance abuse protections — challenging to parse.

Section 6 (Sensitive Information) stands out: it requires individual patient initials for 10 categories of sensitive health information, including abortion care, gender-affirming care, HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, and substance use treatment. This granularity gives patients unusually fine-grained control over disclosure.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fenway Health imposes no unreasonable barriers. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person mandate, and no fees mentioned. Submission channels include mail, fax, email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org), and MyChart portal — four pathways, all adequate for remote submission. The form clearly states revocation rights and a one-year authorization validity period. Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (in the FAQ sheet), well within HIPAA's 30-day requirement. The sensitive information initials requirement, while thorough, could function as a processing delay trigger if patients skip it — the bold warning "COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING" has a somewhat coercive tone.

## Notable Strengths

Fenway Health's standout feature is the companion FAQ sheet (form-2) — a 3-page plain-language guide that walks patients through every section of the ROI form, defining terms like "bi-directional" and "abstract" that would otherwise be opaque. Very few healthcare organizations create separate instructional documents for their ROI forms. The Spanish-language form (form-3) demonstrates commitment to language access, though no Spanish FAQ exists. The inclusion of Massachusetts-specific shield-law language protecting reproductive health and gender-affirming care records reflects both legal compliance and organizational mission. The "Name used (if different)" field thoughtfully accommodates patients whose current name differs from their legal name.

## Weaknesses

The most significant weakness is the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway. The FROM/TO structure is designed for third-party release and does not clearly serve a patient requesting their own records. The lack of fillable fields on a born-digital PDF is a technical oversight that forces an unnecessary print-handwrite-scan workflow. The Spanish form's contact block reverts to English ("Mail/Fax to:", "Attn: Medical Records Dept"), undermining the translation effort.

## Overall Assessment

Fenway Health earns a solid B. The organization demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its FAQ guide, multilingual forms, and sensitive information protections, but falls short on the two key assessment dimensions: it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, and its form is not digitally fillable despite being born-digital. A patient can successfully request their records through this process, but the form was not designed with that use case as a first-class concern.

# OrthoCarolina — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

OrthoCarolina, an independent for-profit orthopedic practice in Charlotte, NC, offers a single generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests — whether the patient is requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party. Three versions of this form (dated 2017, 2020, and 2023) remain simultaneously available at different URLs on the organization's website. The most current version (form-1, revised 04/2023) is the primary form linked from the medical records resource page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

OrthoCarolina does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All requests flow through the same "Authorization for Access/Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under Purpose of Release, which at least signals that patient self-requests are a recognized use case. However, the mandatory recipient section ("This information is to be disclosed to the following individual or entity (MUST BE COMPLETED)") forces patients requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as the disclosure target — a design that treats self-access as just another flavor of third-party release rather than a distinct right under HIPAA § 164.524.

The form makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access, does not explain patient rights to receive records within 30 days, and does not distinguish the fee structure for patient access (which must be reasonable and cost-based) from third-party release fees.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned both the direct PDF link and OrthoCarolina's medical records resource page. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or browser fallback was needed — forms downloaded cleanly via direct URL. The main findability concern is version confusion: three nearly identical forms exist at three different public URLs with no version indicators in the filenames, no redirects from old URLs, and different fax numbers across versions (the 2017 form lists a different fax number). A patient who finds form-2 via a search engine could submit to the wrong fax number.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised as recently as April 2023, it uses underscored blank lines throughout, requiring patients to print and handwrite. A patient determined to complete it digitally would need third-party PDF annotation tools — a workaround, not a designed workflow.

The layout is dense but follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → records requested → radiology images → recipient → purpose → fee notice → delivery method → sensitive information consent → signature. However, the single-page constraint leads to cramped formatting, and the delivery method section has a known layout defect where authorization expiration language overlaps with delivery checkboxes, producing garbled text in the PDF's text layer (problematic for screen readers).

The language is mostly plain, though the sensitive-information consent and revocation clauses run together in a single dense paragraph. The newer form-1 dropped the prominent "YOU MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION" notice that appeared in both older versions — a regression in patient-rights transparency.

## Submission & Delivery

OrthoCarolina offers notably comprehensive submission and delivery options. The form can be submitted via mail, email (OrthoCarolinaMedRec@orthocarolina.com), fax, or patient portal upload. For record delivery, seven options are available: patient portal upload, email (for both records and radiology images), fax, paper mail, CD mail, and in-person pickup. This breadth — particularly the inclusion of email submission and patient portal delivery — is a genuine strength for a physician practice.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness is required. In-person delivery is not mandated. Fees are mentioned but not quantified: "Medical record copy fees are determined by both the nature/purpose of your request and the format/method of delivery." This vagueness, combined with no distinction between patient-access and third-party-release fee structures, creates a risk of overcharging for Right of Access requests. The form also includes a broad liability waiver releasing OrthoCarolina from "any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure" — standard boilerplate but potentially intimidating.

## Overall Assessment

OrthoCarolina earns credit for easy form findability, multiple submission/delivery channels (including email and portal), and a reasonably organized single-page form. However, the lack of any dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields in a 2023-vintage PDF, vague fee language, and the liability waiver embedded in a records request form collectively pull the assessment down. The organization treats patient self-access as undifferentiated from third-party release, missing an opportunity to acknowledge and streamline the exercise of a fundamental HIPAA right. The result is a serviceable but uninspired experience that a patient can navigate — but that was not designed with them in mind.

# The Baton Rouge Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

The Baton Rouge Clinic maintains three distinct medical records forms on a well-organized "Downloadable Forms" page: (1) an outbound release authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information FROM The Baton Rouge Clinic"), (2) an inbound transfer authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information TO The Baton Rouge Clinic"), and (3) a "Right of Access Form" citing HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 164.524. This three-form strategy shows unusual thoughtfulness — the clinic has differentiated between outbound third-party release, inbound records transfer, and patient-directed access, which is more than most organizations offer.

## Patient Self-Access Pathway

The Right of Access form (form-3) is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. At just one page and ~1,300 characters, it is admirably concise compared to the two-page authorization forms. It explicitly cites HIPAA Right of Access authority and offers a choice between electronic and hard copy delivery — a genuine bright spot that many organizations lack.

However, the form has a meaningful design flaw: it is framed entirely as a designee authorization, directing providers to disclose records "to: Name: ___." There is no clear option for a patient to request records for themselves; a patient wanting their own records would need to awkwardly write their own name in the recipient field. The form that most directly invokes the Right of Access isn't actually designed for the most common Right of Access use case — patient self-request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search immediately returned direct PDF links to the authorization forms. All three forms were hosted on a well-organized downloadable forms page at `batonrougeclinic.com/patient-information/downloadable-forms/` with no login, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering required. The one findability gap: the Right of Access form (form-3) was not surfaced by the initial web search and was only discovered by browsing the forms page directly. A patient searching specifically for "how to request my records" might land on the third-party release form instead.

## Form Document Quality

All three forms are flat PDFs with zero fillable fields, despite having clean text layers (not scans). Every form requires printing and hand-filling — a significant accessibility gap, particularly ironic for form-3, which explicitly offers electronic record delivery while requiring a paper submission process. Form-3 has a clean, simple layout with logical flow (patient name → designee → scope → format → duration → signature). The language is relatively plain and accessible. Form-1 uses an asterisk system to mark required fields, which is helpful, though it also requires a Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection burden that form-3 wisely avoids.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. None of the forms disclose fees or state response times. Form-1 includes a hold-harmless clause that goes beyond HIPAA requirements, though form-3 omits this — a more patient-friendly approach. Submission methods are poorly documented: form-1 provides a medical records email (medrecords@brclinic.com) and phone number for questions and urgent requests, but no form explicitly states how to submit the completed document. No fax number is provided. The mailing address appears in footers. A patient completing form-3 has no guidance on where or how to send it.

## Overall Assessment

The Baton Rouge Clinic demonstrates above-average organizational thinking about patient access — the three-form strategy and HIPAA Right of Access citation reflect genuine awareness of different use cases. The Right of Access form's conciseness and electronic delivery option are bright spots. However, the execution falls short in key areas: all forms lack fillable fields, submission pathways are unclear, and the Right of Access form's designee-only framing creates a confusing gap for patients seeking their own records. The clinic has the right structure but needs better implementation — fillable fields, explicit submission instructions, and a self-access option on the Right of Access form would substantially improve the patient experience.

# Wayne County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Monticello, Kentucky. The facility provides a single one-page form for patients requesting their own medical records, along with a parallel web-based HTML form that captures equivalent information online. For a small rural hospital, the availability of dual pathways — PDF and online — is notably progressive.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Only one downloadable PDF was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." This is a patient-access-oriented form, not a generic third-party authorization. The title and structure center on patient self-access, with "self" listed first among record-ownership options (self, child, other). The hospital also offers a web-based HTML form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` that collects equivalent information and allows electronic submission — a genuinely useful alternative to the print-and-deliver workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Wayne County Hospital does a better-than-average job distinguishing patient self-access from third-party release. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" rather than "Authorization for Release of Information," and the patient is addressed directly as the expected user. However, the same single form is used for all requesters — self, child, or other — with no separate instructions or additional authorization requirements for third-party requests. There is no dedicated third-party release form, which means the form functions as a blended instrument, though its default orientation is clearly toward patient access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted web search. The form lives at `/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf` — a media library path that is not linked from any navigable page on the hospital website. The HIM department page provides a phone number but no form download link. There is no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. A patient browsing the website would likely not discover the PDF without calling HIM or using a search engine. The web-based form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` may be more discoverable through site navigation, though this was not confirmed. Retrieval difficulty is moderate — not hard, but requiring search engine assistance rather than intuitive site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable single page. It has a text layer (not a scan) and uses only three fonts, but all fields are represented as underscore blanks — a print-and-handwrite design. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → request type and delivery method → record ownership → dates of service → specific records requested (10 checkboxes) → reason for request → identification presented → signatures. The language is plain and accessible with no legalese. One page is an appropriate length for this type of request.

Delivery options are strong: fax, email, mail, and pick-up. Email as a delivery option is uncommon at critical access hospitals and reduces barriers for rural patients who may live far from the facility.

## Barriers & Compliance Concerns

**Witness requirement:** The form includes a separate "Witness" signature line. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access requests, and this creates a meaningful barrier — a patient filling out the form at home must find a witness before submitting. This is particularly burdensome for rural and isolated patients.

**Reason for request:** The form asks patients to check a reason (Continuity of Care, Personal Interest, Insurance Claims Processing, Legal Claims Processing, Other) without indicating this is optional. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not justify their request.

**Submission method not specified on PDF:** The form itself does not state where or how to return it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is printed on the document. However, the existence of the web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` provides a clear electronic submission pathway.

**Fee transparency:** The form prominently states "Based on KRS 422.317 a first copy of a patient's record will be provided free, subsequent copies may be charged." This Kentucky-law-based disclosure of free first copies is unusually transparent for a facility of this size.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dual pathway (PDF + web form):** Offering both a downloadable PDF and an online web form is exceptional for a 25-bed critical access hospital.
- **Free-copy disclosure on the form itself:** Citing KRS 422.317 about free first copies directly on the form is a bright spot few larger organizations match.
- **Email delivery option:** Including email alongside fax, mail, and pick-up is forward-thinking.
- **One-page brevity:** No unnecessary legal boilerplate — approachable and quick to complete.

## Overall Assessment

Wayne County Hospital demonstrates a patient-centered approach that exceeds expectations for its size and setting. The form is clearly designed for patient self-access, the language is plain, and the availability of an online web form and email delivery are genuine differentiators. The main weaknesses are the witness signature requirement (a real barrier with no legal basis for patient access requests), the unfindability of the PDF on the website, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF. Despite these issues, the overall pathway is solid — a patient can submit their request electronically via the web form, receive records by email, and pay nothing for a first copy.

# Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center provides two distinct PDF forms for health information requests, both accessible from a centralized, facility-specific medical records page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/medical-records-wa/sacred-heart`:

1. **Form 1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" — a general third-party authorization form for disclosing records to an external recipient (insurer, attorney, another provider, etc.). 2 pages, 37 fillable fields.
2. **Form 2** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — a dedicated patient access form for individuals requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). 2 pages, 45 fillable fields.

The facility also offers Spanish versions of both forms, plus additional forms for amendments, accounting of disclosures, restriction/revocation, and Health Information Exchange opt-out — a comprehensive suite rarely seen at individual facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release. The dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" form uses correct HIPAA terminology and is purpose-built for patients requesting their own records. This separation is a significant strength — many organizations force patients through a single generic authorization form regardless of whether they want their own records or are authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was effortless. A single web search returned direct links to the facility-specific medical records page. The page is cleanly organized, with clearly labeled PDF download links and no bot blocking, login walls, or portal gatekeeping. URL naming is descriptive (`wa-sacred-heart-access-designated-record-set.pdf`), and the page is reachable through Providence's main navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form 2 — Primary Patient Access Form)

Form 2 is a natively digital 2-page PDF with 45 interactive fillable fields — checkboxes for record types, delivery formats, and text fields for demographics and date ranges. The form is not an image scan. Page 1 provides instructional text and institutional notices; page 2 contains the input fields. The layout is clean and logically organized.

Five delivery format options are offered: MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, and Fax. The MyChart integration is particularly strong, meeting patients where they likely already have an account. Patients can select specific record types, date ranges, and facilities. A "Last 2 years only" convenience checkbox is a practical touch.

The language is reasonably plain, though it includes some boilerplate legal text. The form includes multilingual language assistance notices (English, Spanish, Chinese) with a toll-free phone number and TTY access. Spanish versions of both forms are separately available.

## Barriers

**Signature**: Both forms require a wet signature ("Print form and sign by hand"), which prevents fully digital completion despite the otherwise comprehensive fillable fields. This is the single most significant barrier.

**Fees**: Form 2 states "Fees may be associated with this request" without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based fee standard. Patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by fax ((509) 474-4815), email (PSHMC.HIMRecords@Providence.org), or mail — multiple remote submission options are available, so in-person delivery is not required.

**No notarization** is required. **No response time** is stated.

## Red Flags and Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The patient access form (form 2) includes a liability release clause typically found on third-party authorization forms, which is inappropriate for a patient exercising their Right of Access. The form also lacks any explicit statement of patient rights (right to receive records, 30-day response timeline, right to appeal denial).

**Bright spots**: The dedicated patient access form, five delivery formats including MyChart, multi-facility awareness ("we would be glad to fax a copy of this form to other facilities"), the centralized portal with Spanish translations, and the proactive SSN disclosure warning on form 1 all demonstrate above-average patient-centeredness.

## Overall Assessment

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center offers one of the better patient access experiences among community hospitals. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, five electronic delivery options, and an exceptionally well-organized web portal demonstrate genuine investment in patient-centered records access. The wet signature requirement and vague fee language are the main drawbacks, preventing a top-tier score. The organization earns a strong B overall — clearly above average, with room for improvement in digital workflow completion and rights transparency.

# Fallon Medical Complex — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Fallon Medical Complex (FMC) is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Baker, Montana — a rural community in the state's eastern plains. FMC publishes three documents on its Information Management page: a primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a verbal release form (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The primary ROI form is the relevant document for a patient seeking copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

FMC does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form — "Authorization for Access, Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same "Release From" / "Release To" fields used when authorizing disclosure to an insurer or attorney. The form does list "Personal" as a purpose option, which is helpful, but provides no guidance on how a patient should fill in the directional fields when they are both the requester and the recipient. This is a common pattern among small facilities, but it means the patient must figure out which parts of the form apply to their situation.

The verbal release form (form-2) is narrowly scoped to phone-based verbal sharing and explicitly directs patients to form-1 for copies. The NPP (form-3) describes patient rights including the right to inspect and copy records but does not cross-reference the actual forms.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Two web searches led directly to the Information Management page at fallonmedical.org, where all three documents are clearly linked. No login walls, CAPTCHAs, or bot blocking were encountered. The one notable issue: the primary ROI form is published as a Microsoft Word .doc file rather than a PDF, hosted on a Google Cloud Storage bucket with "tmp" in the URL path — an unusual and potentially fragile hosting arrangement for a permanent compliance document.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page document with **zero fillable fields**. It was published as a .doc file and had to be converted to PDF for this study. The lack of fillable fields means every patient must print and handwrite their information. The form has a text layer (not a scan), uses 5 fonts, and is visually legible, but the non-interactive format is a significant accessibility gap — especially for a geographically isolated community where patients may live far from the facility.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → release routing → purpose → record types → date range → disclosure format → sensitive information → patient rights → signatures. The information-type checkboxes offer good granularity (10 categories from "Emergency Report/Records" to "Entire Medical Record"). The dual sensitive-information sections — one for categories to include, one to exclude — are structurally sound but confusingly similar, with identical checkbox labels distinguished only by a header word.

Language is a mix of accessible and legalistic. The "I Understand That" section covers core rights (revocation, non-conditioning, inspection under §164.524) but is dense. There are two spelling errors ("immunodefiency" twice, "proving" for "providing") and a confusing interstitial note ("IF SENDING RECORDS TO FMC, PLEASE MAIL IF MORE THAN 20 PAGES") apparently directed at other facilities rather than patients.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization is required (the witness signature is in the "For Office Use Only" section). Photo ID is required for fax, mail, or email submissions — reasonable identity verification, though potentially burdensome for patients without government-issued ID. The statement "A HIM professional will supervise the review of my medical record" adds friction to in-person review that may feel paternalistic.

**Notable bright spots for a rural CAH:**
- **First copy free** — the form explicitly states patients may receive the first copy without charge, reducing financial barriers.
- **Seven disclosure format options** — paper mail, USB drive/disc, electronic fax, review only, paper pick-up, unencrypted email (with informed consent), and patient portal access. This is remarkably comprehensive for a 25-bed rural hospital.
- **Patient portal integration** — offering portal signup directly from the ROI form bridges paper and digital workflows.
- **Unencrypted email with informed consent** — respects patient autonomy while ensuring awareness of risks.

Submission of the completed form appears possible via fax, mail, or email (implied by the ID requirement language), meaning patients do not need to physically visit the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fallon Medical Complex demonstrates a sincere effort to serve patients within the constraints of a small rural facility. The breadth of delivery format options is genuinely impressive and patient-centered. However, the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a patient access request, published in an outdated format (.doc) with no fillable fields. A patient must print, handwrite, and fax or mail the form — a workflow that falls short of modern accessibility expectations. For a critical access hospital in rural Montana, FMC does better than many peers, but meaningful improvements are within reach: converting to a fillable PDF, separating the patient access pathway, and adding clear instructions for self-access requests would significantly improve the experience.

# Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Penn Medicine (the parent system for HUP) provides two main pathways for patients seeking their medical records. The **primary pathway** for patient self-access is the **myPennMedicine patient portal**, which the organization's website explicitly directs patients toward. The **secondary pathway** is a downloadable PDF — the "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (form UPHS-099-9, revised December 2020) — a system-wide authorization form used across all Penn Medicine facilities.

Two versions of this PDF form were found: the current version (form-1.pdf) hosted on Penn Medicine's own infrastructure, and an outdated 2018 version (form-2.pdf) hosted on a third-party neurology practice website. The current form is the basis for this quality assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Penn Medicine **partially differentiates** patient self-access from third-party release — but only at the website level, not at the form level. The patient access web page directs patients wanting their own records to the myPennMedicine portal, reserving the PDF authorization form for broader disclosure purposes. However, the form itself is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that makes no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. A patient using the form must fill in their own name in the "I request my PHI to be released to" field, which is functional but not intuitive. The form includes one notable sentence acknowledging patient rights: "I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the authorization form required **moderate effort**. A web search surfaced the form from Penn's medical school subdomain (med.upenn.edu). The official Penn Medicine patient access page links to the same form but was initially blocked by **Incapsula bot protection** on programmatic fetches, requiring browser fallback. The form is not immediately discoverable from the Penn Medicine homepage — patients must navigate to Patient Resources → Patient Access Health Information.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a **strong digital artifact** with **70 fillable interactive fields** — covering patient demographics, facility checkboxes, 14 record-type selections, behavioral health/SUD opt-in, delivery method, and signature blocks. The ADA-accessible designation in the filename suggests intentional accessibility design. The layout is well-organized across two pages: page 1 contains the authorization itself, page 2 provides detailed instructions with submission addresses for six Penn Medicine hospitals.

Language quality is mixed: core instructions are clear, but the authorization section uses dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation. The behavioral health consent language is notably well-written and patient-respectful.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Submission method is the key barrier.** The PDF form must be physically mailed to the appropriate hospital's Medical Records Department — there is no fax submission (Penn Medicine explicitly restricts fax to urgent patient care situations), no email submission of the form, and no online submission pathway for the authorization itself. This makes the PDF pathway a predominantly paper-based process despite the excellent digital form.

**Fee transparency is weak.** The form states Penn Medicine "will charge for copying records in accordance with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware law" without specifying amounts. This references state law rather than HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient access, potentially resulting in overcharging. Radiology images are explicitly free.

**Ambulatory carve-out is buried.** The instruction that "Any Ambulatory/Office Visit requests should be addressed to the individual Physician's Office" is on page 2 and could cause patients to miss outpatient records.

## Notable Strengths

- **70 fillable PDF fields** — among the most thoroughly digitized forms encountered
- **ADA-accessible** PDF design with proper text encoding and interactive elements
- **Granular record selection** with 14 types plus behavioral health/SUD opt-in
- **Explicit patient rights language** acknowledging the right to inspect records directly
- **Free radiology images** — a patient-friendly policy
- **Clear compliance provisions**: 30/60-day response timelines, denial/appeal rights with Chief Privacy Officer contact, no notarization required, treatment not conditioned on signing

## Overall Assessment

Penn Medicine demonstrates institutional competence in form design — the fillable PDF is technically excellent and the instructions are thorough. However, the organization's approach to patient self-access is bifurcated: the portal handles self-access while the PDF form serves as a general-purpose disclosure authorization that doesn't optimize for individual access rights. The mail-only submission requirement for the PDF form is a meaningful barrier. A patient who cannot or does not use the portal faces a paper-based workflow despite the digitally fillable form. For a major academic medical center, the gap between the quality of the form document and the quality of the submission/delivery infrastructure is notable.

# Colquitt Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Colquitt Regional Medical Center (Moultrie, GA) is an independent, government-owned community hospital. The organization offers a single downloadable PDF form for medical records requests, found on its Health Records & Patient Portal page. No online portal, patient portal integration, or alternative digital pathway was identified for requesting records.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was retrieved: an "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for releasing records to third parties. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a patient portal–based records request workflow. The sole pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — though the form itself provides no submission instructions (no fax number, mailing address, or email).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as an authorization for disclosure to a named recipient (item 5 asks for recipient "Name" and "Address"). While item 6 includes a "my personal records" purpose checkbox — a helpful nod toward self-access — the form does not explain what a patient should enter as the recipient when requesting their own records. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of patient access rights, and no separate pathway or instructions for patients who simply want their own medical records. A patient must navigate a form designed for third-party release and adapt it to their self-access needs.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped search quickly identified the Health Records & Patient Portal page, and the form was linked with a clearly labeled "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button — approximately two clicks from the homepage. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy**, and no bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page scanned image** with no meaningful text layer (only 11 characters of noise extracted) and zero fillable fields. It was created in 2021 using scanning software ("Transform Foundation Server"), confirming it is a digitized paper form rather than a digitally authored document. The form is completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology, cannot be filled digitally, and must be printed and completed by hand.

Despite the poor technical quality, the content design is adequate. The 10-item numbered list provides a logical flow: patient identification → who may disclose → record types → sensitive information acknowledgment → recipient → purpose → legal terms → signatures. Twelve record-type checkboxes offer useful granularity. The language mixes plain English with some legal phrasing — mostly readable but occasionally dense (e.g., the revocation paragraph). There are no section headers, boxes, or visual groupings to aid navigation, but the single-page length keeps complexity manageable.

## Barriers

- **No submission instructions**: The form contains no fax number, mailing address, email, or department name. A patient downloading the form has no guidance on how to return it. The website's Health Records page may provide this information, but it is absent from the form itself.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" line is present, which may lead patients to believe a witness is required — HIPAA does not require this for patient access requests.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form makes no mention of fees or costs for records.
- **No date range field**: Patients cannot specify a time period for the records they want.
- **No delivery format options**: No choices for electronic vs. paper delivery.

## Bright Spots

- **Easy findability**: The form was prominently linked from a clearly labeled page.
- **Voluntariness statement**: Item 10 explicitly states that signing is voluntary and will not affect treatment.
- **Patient-controlled expiration**: Item 8 lets the patient set their own authorization expiration date.
- **"My personal records" purpose checkbox**: While the form is generic, this option at least acknowledges that patients may be requesting their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Colquitt Regional Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request pathway. The form is easy to find, but it is a scanned image that cannot be filled digitally, lacks submission instructions, and does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The technical quality is poor — an image-only scan with no fillable fields and no accessibility support. A patient attempting to request their own records faces a form not designed for their use case, must print and handwrite their responses, and receives no guidance on how to submit the completed form. The organization earns credit for findability and a few patient-friendly touches (voluntariness statement, patient-controlled expiration), but the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) provides a well-organized, multi-channel records request system anchored by a system-wide "Tripartite" HIPAA authorization form shared across NYP, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medicine. Three documents were retrieved: the primary Tripartite ROI form (form-1), a patient-facing FAQ (form-2), and an older Lawrence campus-specific variant (form-3). The organization directs patients primarily to a Verisma online portal, with MyChart and paper form submission as alternatives.

## Access Pathway & Differentiation

NYP offers genuine differentiation at the pathway level: the medical records page provides separate Verisma portal links for Patient, Patient Representative, and Attorney workflows. This is a meaningful distinction that helps patients identify their correct route. However, the underlying authorization framework remains generic — the paper form (form-1) is a single HIPAA authorization used for all disclosure types, with "Patient Request" as one of seven checkboxes alongside Life Insurance, Legal Purposes, and Worker's Comp. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish the legal framework for patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization section states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records," which is accurate for third-party releases but misleading for patient access requests, where HIPAA requires only a written request, not a signed authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records) leads to a well-organized page. Web searches readily surface both the medical records page and direct PDF links. The form is hosted on a digital asset management platform (nyp.widen.net), which initially served an HTML viewer rather than the raw PDF, requiring some effort to extract the actual download URL. This is a minor friction point for an otherwise easy retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is technically excellent. It is a born-digital, fully interactive PDF with 103 fillable fields — one of the most technically capable ROI forms in this study. The 2-page form follows a logical flow through patient demographics, recipient information, disclosing entity selection (covering all 11 NYP campuses plus outpatient groups), granular record-type checkboxes (16+ options including "Entire Medical Record"), sensitive information authorization (compliant with New York state law for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing), six delivery methods, and a numbered authorization section. The layout is clean with bold section headers, though the density of content on two pages results in small text in places. The authorization language includes some compound legalese that is difficult to parse, but the overall organization is strong.

The form is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese — a notable accommodation for New York City's diverse population.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on the primary form (though the older Lawrence form-3 includes a "Witness or Notary" line). The Verisma portal requires two forms of photo ID, which exceeds typical HIPAA identity verification expectations and may exclude patients without two scannable photo IDs. The form mandates a date-of-service range, stating "records will not be released unless Date of Service section is complete" — a potential barrier for patients seeking their complete longitudinal record. Fees are described as "reasonable fees to recover costs," tracking HIPAA's statutory language without specifying amounts. No response time commitment appears on the form or FAQ.

## Notable Strengths

NYP's system stands out for its dedicated phone line (646-NYP-4ROI, M-F 8am-6pm), multilingual form availability, comprehensive FAQ document with transparent MyChart record-type listings, and the sheer technical quality of the fillable PDF. The six delivery options — paper, fax, email, CD, flash drive, and patient portal (at no cost) — give patients meaningful choice.

## Overall Assessment

NYP delivers a technically strong, well-organized records request experience with good findability and multiple access channels. The main weakness is the lack of a truly patient-access-specific pathway: despite portal-level differentiation, the underlying form treats patient self-access as one use case among many without acknowledging the distinct legal rights involved. The two-photo-ID portal requirement and mandatory date-of-service range create unnecessary friction. Overall, this is a solid B-level experience — above average in technical execution but falling short of patient-centered design.

# Desert Valley Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Valley Hospital (DVH) is a for-profit community hospital in Victorville, CA, part of the Prime Healthcare system. A patient attempting to request their own medical records online faces significant barriers: DVH's website describes the records request process but provides no downloadable authorization form. The only usable patient-facing form was found on a sister Prime Healthcare hospital's website (Chino Valley Medical Center), using a system-wide template that DVH presumably also uses but has not published.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved during an exhaustive search:

1. **Form-2 (PHSI-280-014 CVMC)** — the most relevant document. A 2-page general HIPAA authorization form from Chino Valley Medical Center, a Prime Healthcare sister hospital. This system-wide template is the standard patient ROI form across Prime Healthcare facilities. It has 47 fillable fields, granular record-type selection, and a clear patient rights section. However, it is branded for CVMC, not DVH.

2. **Form-1 (PHSI-320-012)** — an employee-only authorization for Prime Healthcare's internal health plan. Explicitly marked "FOR PRIME EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ENROLLED DEPENDENTS USE ONLY." Not applicable to general patients.

3. **Form-3** — an employment services authorization from Desert Valley Medical Group for occupational health services (DOT physicals, drug screens). Not an ROI form.

The DVH Medical Records page (dvmc.com/patients-visitors/medical-records/) instructs patients to submit requests via mail, fax, or in person, with a $15 fee and 14-business-day turnaround. No online portal, no downloadable form, and no email submission option are offered.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DVH does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The Prime Healthcare template (form-2) is a generic "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" designed for all release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both the authorizing entity and themselves as recipient — workable but not optimized for self-request. The form does include a "patient request" checkbox under Purpose, which at least acknowledges this use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was rated **Hard**. The dvmc.com website was thoroughly searched — including sitemap crawling and URL pattern probing — with no authorization form found. The Desert Valley Medical Group site yielded only the employment services form. Success required identifying the Prime Healthcare parent system and checking sister hospitals' websites. A typical patient would have no way to discover or download the form online.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2) has notable technical strengths: 47 fillable interactive fields allow on-screen completion, and the document has a full text layer. The 2-page layout follows a logical sequence — demographics, release details, record-type selection, purpose, expiration, patient rights, format options, and signature. The "MY RIGHTS" section uses clear first-person language explaining refusal rights, inspection rights, and revocation procedures. HITECH electronic format options (CD, paper, email) are explicitly cited.

However, weaknesses are present: the form requests a full Social Security Number (unnecessary and a privacy risk), the opening warns that incomplete forms "may invalidate this Authorization" (potentially coercive), a "Witness" line appears without guidance on whether it's required, the header contains a typo ("OR" instead of "OF"), and field names are not accessible (empty in metadata, potentially impacting screen readers). The 1.65 MB file size for a 2-page form reflects poor optimization.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is explicitly required. Fax submission is available (an adequate electronic pathway). The $15 fee is disclosed only on the website, not on the form itself. The SSN collection and completeness-invalidation warning are the most concerning compliance issues — SSN is not required by HIPAA for records requests, and the warning could pressure patients into providing unnecessary information. The witness line creates ambiguity that may deter patients. The "financially responsible party" listed as an authorized signer raises questions about conflating billing and health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 47 interactive fields — significantly better than many flat/print-only forms
- HITECH electronic format citation with email delivery option
- Granular sensitive-information consent (seven categories requiring individual initials)
- Clear patient rights section with California-specific re-disclosure language

## Overall Assessment

Desert Valley Hospital earns a **C grade**. While the underlying Prime Healthcare form template is reasonably well-designed with fillable fields and a clear rights section, the hospital's failure to publish any patient-facing form online creates a fundamental access barrier. A patient must either contact HIM by phone to obtain the form, visit in person, or discover it on a sister hospital's website — none of which constitute an accessible online pathway. The generic authorization design, SSN collection, and coercive completeness language further reduce patient-centeredness.

# Ascension St. Vincent's East — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension St. Vincent's East is a community hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the Ascension health system that has recently partnered with or been rebranded under UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). This branding transition is the defining feature of the patient experience: two forms exist on two different websites under two different organizational names, and a patient searching under the facility's commonly known name may land on the wrong (legacy) form.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF authorization forms were found:

- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An Ascension St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization To Disclose Protected Health Information" revised February 2022, hosted on `healthcare.ascension.org` in a URL path containing the word "legacy." This 2.8 MB, 2-page form is a general-purpose ROI authorization with no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. It collects Social Security Number, lists notarized signature among identity verification options, and requires a witness signature — all potential barriers. On the positive side, it explicitly cites CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access).

- **form-2.pdf** (current): A UAB St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records" dated February 2026, hosted on `uabstvincents.org`. This is the current, most relevant form. At 143 KB and 2 pages, it is a cleaner, digital-origin document. It explicitly lists "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department" as a selectable location and includes a checkbox for "me for my personal use" — a meaningful distinction from forms that only contemplate third-party release.

The best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-2, which accommodates patient self-access as a first-class option alongside third-party authorization.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Form-2 does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release via a checkbox ("me for my personal use" vs. "the party indicated below"). This is a genuine improvement over many ROI forms and over this facility's own predecessor form. However, form-2 remains a generic authorization form — not a dedicated patient access request form. The same form, same legal language, and same process apply whether the patient wants their own records or is authorizing release to an insurer or attorney. A patient must navigate legal language about re-disclosure, initial two dense paragraphs about revocation and non-conditioning, and understand which fields apply to their scenario.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form required moderate effort. Initial searches for "Ascension St. Vincent's East" yielded system-wide Ascension forms from other states. An Alabama-specific search found the legacy form-1 on the Ascension domain. Only a separate search for "UAB St. Vincent's" uncovered the current form-2 on the UAB domain. A patient who knows this facility by its Ascension name would likely find only the outdated 2022 form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed — both PDFs downloaded directly.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a digital-origin PDF with a text layer, reasonable file size, and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all entries must be handwritten after printing. The form uses horizontal rules to separate sections and offers a well-designed tiered record selection (Key Clinical Notes bundle, Entire Medical Record, or specific report types). The "Key Clinical Notes" option — pre-defined as discharge summary, operative reports, labs, radiology, and ED documentation — is a genuine usability bright spot that helps patients who don't know medical terminology.

The opening paragraph front-loads dense legal language before the patient even fills in their name. The form contains a contradictory treatment of sensitive records: the opening paragraph states the request "includes" psychiatric and substance use information, while a later checkbox asks whether to include it. The submission instructions are indirect — rather than printing a mailing address, the form directs patients to visit a website.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-2 removes several barriers present in the legacy form: no Social Security Number field, no notarization option, no witness requirement. Non-conditioning and revocation rights are clearly stated (with initialing required). However, the form provides no fee disclosure whatsoever — patients have no idea what records will cost. The HIPAA Right of Access citation (CFR 164.524) present in form-1 was dropped in form-2, a notable regression. Submission appears limited to physical mail; no fax number or electronic submission option for the completed form is stated.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension St. Vincent's East earns credit for a reasonably well-designed authorization form that explicitly accommodates patient self-access with a personal-use checkbox and offers tiered record selection. However, the experience is undermined by the branding transition that makes the current form hard to find, zero fillable fields requiring a fully paper workflow, apparent mail-only form submission, and absent fee disclosure. The result is a facility that has the right instincts on patient-centeredness but falls short on digital accessibility and transparency.

# Ben Taub Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ben Taub Hospital is a government-owned community hospital in Houston, TX, part of the **Harris Health System**. It uses system-level forms for medical records requests — both downloaded PDFs are branded Harris Health documents, not Ben Taub–specific materials.

## Forms & Pathways

Two forms were retrieved. **Form-1** ("Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information") is the sole relevant document for a patient seeking their own records. **Form-2** is a marketing/media authorization unrelated to patient record access. Only form-1 is assessed below.

The medical records page at harrishealth.org clearly explains the request process and offers four submission channels: **mail, fax, email, and in-person drop-off**. Contact details — including phone (346-426-0980), fax (346-426-0959), and a dedicated email (Releaseofinformation@harrishealth.org) — are printed directly on the form. A patient can fill the form digitally and submit via fax or email without visiting the facility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Harris Health uses a **single dual-purpose authorization form** for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form handles this well through conditional sections: the "Purpose of Request/Disclosure" and "Expiration" sections are explicitly marked as "only required if the individual providing this authorization form to Harris Health is someone other than the patient." This means patients can skip irrelevant sections without needing a separate form. It is not a dedicated patient access form, but it clearly accommodates patient self-access as a first-class use case.

The email delivery option is labeled "Email Address (Patients Only)," further demonstrating that patient access is specifically considered in the form's design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and it is directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or rendering issues were encountered. The PDF URL is descriptive and identifiable in search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **65 interactive form fields** — a strong digital-first design. However, the fields lack programmatic names, reducing accessibility for screen readers and auto-fill. The form covers patient identification, recipient details, facility selection (with Ben Taub specifically listed), 14+ record type checkboxes, format options (paper, CD, email), sensitive information consent, and signature blocks — all on one page.

The layout is **dense but logically organized**, flowing from patient info → recipient → records scope → format → purpose → expiration → signatures. Section headers are minimal, and the cramped single-page layout sacrifices visual clarity for compactness. Language is moderately clear, leaning toward legal/administrative phrasing, but includes a well-worded non-conditioning statement. The form was recently revised (December 2024), suggesting active document management.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization is required and no fees are mentioned. Multiple submission channels are available. One notable concern: the form includes a **witness signature line** without clarifying whether a witness is truly required or who qualifies. This could be a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.

The form's footer includes an **internal intranet URL** (apps.hchd.local) — inaccessible to patients and a document-control oversight. The fillable fields lack programmatic names, an accessibility deficiency.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery explicitly for patients** — the "Patients Only" label on the email option is a meaningful patient-access accommodation
- **Conditional sections** that let patients skip third-party–only fields
- **Granular record type selection** with 14+ categories and proper psychotherapy notes separation
- **Multiple submission channels** with contact details printed on the form
- **Dedicated authorization withdrawal email** (AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org)

## Overall Assessment

Ben Taub Hospital, through Harris Health System, provides a **competent, accessible records request process**. The form is findable, fillable, and submittable electronically. While it uses a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, it thoughtfully accommodates patient self-access through conditional sections and patient-specific features like email delivery. The witness signature ambiguity and unnamed form fields are the primary weaknesses. Overall, this represents a solid B-level experience — functional and reasonably patient-friendly, with room for improvement in form clarity and dedicated patient access design.

# Cuba Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cuba Memorial Hospital is a small, independent critical access hospital in Cuba, NY, affiliated with the Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) alongside Olean General Hospital (OGH) and Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC). The hospital does not publish its own medical records request form. Instead, patients must discover and use ROI forms from affiliated UAHS facilities, found on a separate organization's website.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two forms were retrieved, both from the BRMC-OGH website (brmc-ogh.org), not from Cuba Memorial's own site:

- **Form 1 (OGH)**: "Authorization for Patient Access and/or Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," branded for Olean General Hospital. This is the most relevant form since both OGH and Cuba Memorial are New York facilities within UAHS.
- **Form 2 (BRMC)**: Nearly identical form branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Less relevant due to cross-state jurisdiction, but its blank disclosing-organization field makes it theoretically more adaptable.

The hospital's website also mentions a "YourHEALTH" patient portal for electronic record access, but no ROI form or formal request process is linked from the portal page.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are dual-purpose: their title explicitly covers both "Patient Access" and "Use and Disclosure." Section 4 includes dedicated checkboxes for patient inspection or copies, alongside a third-party release authorization line. This is a modest positive — the form acknowledges patient self-access as a use case rather than treating it as an afterthought. However, the form is fundamentally a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all release purposes, not a dedicated patient access form. A Cuba Memorial patient must also contend with the fact that neither form mentions their hospital by name, creating real confusion about which form to use and where to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was moderately difficult. Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website has no medical records page, no patient forms section, and no downloadable ROI form. Multiple search strategies — including site-specific searches, direct navigation, and sitemap review — yielded nothing. The forms were only discovered by following a small footer link from Cuba Memorial's site to the BRMC-OGH website, then navigating to the medical records page. A patient would need to recognize this footer link as relevant, navigate a different organization's site, and infer that the "OGH" form applies to their Cuba Memorial records — a non-obvious multi-step process.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are 2-page, digitally produced PDFs with text layers — not scans. However, neither has fillable fields (fillable_field_count: 0). Patients must print and complete them by hand. The forms use a numbered seven-section structure (authorization statement, disclosing organization, record types, recipient/patient access, patient rights, expiration, specially protected information) that provides reasonable organization. Approximately 15 fields require completion for a patient self-access request.

The language is moderately legalistic but generally comprehensible. Patient rights statements in Section 5 cover voluntariness, no treatment impact, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, and right to copies. However, a typo in Section 5(c) — "but in do" instead of "but if I do" — has persisted across both forms since at least 2017, suggesting the templates are unmaintained.

## Barriers

- **No clear submission pathway**: The forms provide no instructions for how to submit them. The bolded statement "Photo ID is required for records to be picked up" implies in-person pickup as the expected or only delivery method. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or online submission option is mentioned on the form or the BRMC-OGH medical records page.
- **Witness lines**: Dedicated witness signature lines appear without indication of whether witnessing is required or optional, potentially deterring patients from submitting unwitnessed forms.
- **90-day expiration**: Authorization expires after 90 days, which is unnecessary for patient access requests under HIPAA's ongoing right of access.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) mentions "a reasonable copy fee" with no specifics or fee schedule reference.
- **Outdated forms**: Both forms were last revised in January 2017, predating Information Blocking rules and 21st Century Cures Act implementation.

## Strengths

- The form explicitly contemplates patient self-access with dedicated inspection/copies checkboxes — relatively uncommon among generic authorization forms.
- Granular record type selection (11 categories with date ranges) gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.
- Appropriate handling of specially protected information (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) with separate consent checkboxes consistent with New York law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Overall Assessment

Cuba Memorial Hospital presents significant access challenges for patients seeking their own records online. The hospital publishes no form of its own, requiring patients to navigate to an affiliated organization's website and use a form branded for a different hospital. The forms themselves, while structurally adequate and notably inclusive of patient self-access checkboxes, are non-fillable, outdated, and provide no guidance on submission or delivery methods. The implied requirement for in-person pickup with photo ID — potentially at a facility 30+ miles away — represents a meaningful barrier for a rural critical access hospital population. The overall experience falls short of patient-centered design, earning a grade of C.

# Vanderbilt University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Vanderbilt Health offers patients multiple pathways to request their medical records. The official medical records page at vanderbilthealth.com lists both downloadable PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish) and three online portals: a **Swellbox patient request portal**, a Swellbox provider request portal, and a ChartSwap third-party request portal. The separation of these portals by requester type — patient, provider, and third party — is a meaningful structural differentiator that many organizations lack.

Five PDF documents were discovered across Vanderbilt web properties. The current official English form is **form-4.pdf** (VMR 3017, dated 10/2023), a 2-page authorization linked from the main medical records page. Form-5 is its Spanish translation. Forms 1 and 2 are older versions (2022 and 2017 respectively) still publicly hosted on VUMC subdomains with no deprecation notice. Form-3 is an incoming-records form (release TO Vanderbilt) irrelevant to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Vanderbilt partially differentiates individual access from third-party release. At the portal level, the separation is clear: patients, providers, and third parties each have distinct Swellbox/ChartSwap entry points. However, at the PDF form level, Vanderbilt uses a single generic "Authorization for the Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — a HIPAA § 164.508 authorization form doing double duty for patient access requests that should technically fall under § 164.524 Right of Access. The form does correctly scope the purpose question in Section 8, noting it is only required "if not for your personal use," which recognizes patient self-access as the default. But the overall framing ("I hereby give Vanderbilt Health permission to disclose my individually identifiable protected health information") miscasts a patient right as a permission grant.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. The official vanderbilthealth.com medical records page clearly links both the English and Spanish PDFs under "Request Records by Authorization Form," and all downloads succeeded without bot blocking or login walls. The primary findability concern is that **outdated versions persist** on VUMC subdomains (student health, information privacy & security) — a patient searching Google could land on the 2017 or 2022 version, which has different fee structures, fewer facilities, and old branding, with no indication it's superseded.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4 is compact and well-organized, condensed from the older 4-page format to 2 pages with 10 numbered sections and clear bold headers. However, it is fundamentally an **image-only scan** — zero fillable fields, only 61 characters of extractable text, and no screen-reader accessibility. A patient must print it, complete it by hand, and submit via mail or fax. The electronic delivery option described in Section 4 (PDF through a request portal, directions sent to email) is a genuine patient-friendly feature. The fee schedule, while complex (6 scenarios), is transparently disclosed with all fees capped at $50 and a $6.50 flat rate for fully electronic delivery.

The form requests Last 4 SSN, which is more personal information than necessary. Section 9's acknowledgment section packs 11 bullet points of legal text in small font. The sensitive-information handling (Section 6) defaults to including psychiatric, substance use, and HIV information with an opt-out checkbox — permissible but puts the burden on the patient.

## Barriers and Strengths

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization or witness is required. Submission is possible via fax (adequate electronic pathway) and mail, plus the Swellbox portal provides a fully digital alternative. The 30-day response timeline is stated explicitly, and the form commits to no treatment conditioning. Fees are disclosed upfront and capped.

**Notable strengths** include: the Spanish-language version linked alongside the English form; the differentiated Swellbox patient portal as a digital alternative; the transparent and capped fee schedule; the correctly scoped purpose question; and the inclusion of an electronic delivery option via a request portal. The QR code on the form header may provide an additional pathway, though its destination isn't determinable from the PDF.

**Red flags** are the dual-purpose authorization framing, the persistence of outdated forms on subdomains, and the image-only scan format — surprising for a 2023 form from a major academic medical center that fails basic WCAG/Section 508 accessibility standards.

## Overall Assessment

Vanderbilt Health provides a **competent but imperfect** patient records request experience. The organization earns credit for offering differentiated digital pathways (Swellbox patient portal), a Spanish translation, transparent fees, and a well-organized 2-page form. It falls short on digital-first form design (image-only scan, no fillable fields) and conflates patient access rights with third-party authorization. The availability of the Swellbox portal as an alternative substantially mitigates the PDF's technical limitations, making this an organization that serves digitally-savvy patients reasonably well while leaving paper-dependent patients with an unnecessarily cumbersome experience.

# Michigan Medicine – University of Michigan Health: Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Michigan Medicine provides three publicly available forms related to medical records, though only one is relevant for patient self-access. **Form-1** (70-10015, VER: A/24) is the current "Authorization to Release Copies of a Medical Record," a 3-page document that serves as the primary ROI form for both patient self-requests and third-party releases. **Form-2** is an outdated 2011 version of the same form, still indexed on the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain — a housekeeping gap that could confuse patients. **Form-3** is an inbound records request form (authorizing Michigan Medicine to pull records from other providers), unrelated to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves dual purposes, but it does meaningfully differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Item 2 provides a dedicated "Myself" checkbox with delivery options tailored to patients (Patient Portal, electronic email web link, US Mail), while item 3 handles third-party recipients with its own delivery methods. This structural separation gives patients a clear path without needing to decode which sections apply to them. Additionally, the form prominently promotes the **MyUofMHealth Patient Portal** as a free, zero-cost delivery channel — a strong nudge toward the most convenient option. However, the form remains fundamentally an authorization rather than a dedicated patient access request, and the fee schedule and prepayment language do not clearly exempt patient self-requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search for Michigan Medicine's ROI form immediately returned direct links to the current PDF on `uofmhealth.org`. No site navigation was required. The download was unobstructed — no CAPTCHAs or bot blocking on the primary domain (though the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain had Cloudflare challenges). The one annoyance is the uninformative filename (`ROI_.pdf`).

## Form Document Quality

The form has a proper text layer and clean digital design — it is not a scan. However, despite the full text layer, **no fillable/interactive PDF fields exist** (metadata confirms `fillable_field_count: 0`). A patient must print and handwrite or use a PDF annotation tool. For submission, fax (734-936-8571) and mail are available; notably, **no walk-in services** are offered — a departure from the 2011 version which accepted in-person delivery at any registration desk.

The layout uses numbered sections (1–9) that follow a logical progression: voluntariness statement → patient info → self/third-party selection → purpose → record set → expiration → revocation → signature → fees. The **package-based record selection** system is a genuine bright spot: instead of requiring patients to specify individual record types, it offers pre-built packages (Package 1: Key Clinical Documentation; Package 2: All Clinical Documentation) mapped to common purposes. This simplifies what is typically one of the most confusing parts of any ROI form.

Language is bureaucratic but generally comprehensible. Legal disclosures (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure risks) are clearly stated. Some passages are dense, particularly the insurance authorization exception clause. The fee schedule on page 3 is presented as a clear table with a helpful "No Cost Services" sidebar.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are disclosed transparently: portal access is free, electronic delivery to patients costs $6.89, and third-party requests incur higher per-page fees. The $6.89 patient fee is close to HIPAA's cost-based guidance but not explicitly justified as cost-based. More concerning is the prepayment language — "Some records requested for legal, insurance, or personal use may require a prepayment" — where "personal use" could be read to include patient self-requests, potentially conflicting with HIPAA's prohibition on conditioning access on payment.

The authorization defaults to a 60-day expiration, which is relatively short given the stated turnaround of 5–7 business days (with a caveat to "allow up to 30 days"). Turnaround time discrepancies between pages 2 and 3 add confusion. The form also names **Vital Chart (VRC)** as the third-party vendor handling records fulfillment — a transparency bright spot that sets patient expectations for communications from an unfamiliar sender.

## Overall Assessment

Michigan Medicine provides a competent, moderately patient-centered records request process. The form is well-organized, the package system simplifies record selection, and the portal promotion guides patients toward a free pathway. However, the lack of fillable PDF fields, the ambiguous prepayment language, and the elimination of walk-in services create friction. The continued availability of the outdated 2011 form is a minor but avoidable risk. This is a solid B-level experience: functional and accessible, with room for improvement in digital form design and compliance clarity.

# Baptist Health Lexington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Baptist Health Lexington is a community hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, part of the Baptist Health (Kentucky) system. It does not maintain facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it relies on system-wide forms published by the parent system at baptisthealth.com. Three documents were retrieved, all system-level.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found:

1. **Form 1 (Primary):** "Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — the current system-wide authorization form, revised February 2026. A 3-page, dual-purpose document covering both patient self-access ("Myself" checkbox) and third-party release ("Other person/organization" checkbox). Includes delivery method options (paper, fax, email, CD, MyChart), record type packages, sensitive information consent, and a helpful "Tips" page. Submission is via fax or mail to a centralized Release of Information office in Louisville.

2. **Form 2:** "Request for Medical Records" — a simpler, 1-page patient-access-specific form hosted on the MyChart portal (mychart.baptist-health.org). Explicitly framed for patients requesting their own records. Dated July 2019, making it nearly seven years old. Notably, it contains no submission instructions — no address, fax number, or email.

3. **Form 3:** An older, undated version of the same system-wide authorization (Form 1). Two pages, still publicly accessible alongside the 2026 version at a non-versioned URL, creating potential patient confusion.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Baptist Health demonstrates partial differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (Form 1) is a generic HIPAA authorization, but it clearly labels a "Myself" option on its first page and notes that purpose of release is "not required if being disclosed directly to patient." A dedicated patient access form (Form 2) does exist but is outdated and lacks submission instructions, making it less useful in practice. The primary pathway a patient would encounter — through the medical records page at baptisthealth.com — is the generic authorization form with a patient self-access checkbox.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Basic web searches and the organization's medical records page led directly to downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The only friction is that a patient searching specifically for "Baptist Health Lexington" must recognize that the parent system's form applies. The coexistence of old and new form versions at similar URLs is a minor navigational hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (Form 1) is digitally authored with a text layer and clean typography, but has **zero fillable fields**. All entry areas are blank lines and non-interactive checkbox graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is well-organized with clear section headers (Patient Info, Release To / Delivery Method, Purpose, Information to Release) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. The record type "Package" system (Key Documentation vs. All Documentation) with detailed descriptions is genuinely helpful. The third page ("Tips for Requesting Medical Record Copies") provides useful practical guidance including a 15-calendar-day turnaround goal, MyChart default delivery, and contact information.

Language is mostly plain on page 1 but dense with required legal text on page 2 — HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder (42 CFR Part 2), revocation rights, and re-disclosure warnings. The sensitive information consent is bundled as an all-or-nothing authorization with no opt-out for individual categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Not fillable:** Despite being digitally created, no forms offer interactive fields — a significant missed opportunity.
- **SSN collection:** The last 4 digits of SSN are requested without being marked optional, exceeding what HIPAA requires for patient identification.
- **Sensitive information bundling:** The authorization bundles consent for mental health, HIV/AIDS, and substance use disorder records with no ability to exclude specific categories.
- **Outdated form still live:** Form 3 (undated older version) remains publicly accessible and could lead patients to use a superseded form with a potentially incorrect mailing address.
- **No fees mentioned:** While appropriate for patient access under HIPAA, the absence of any fee information leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart as default delivery:** If no delivery method is specified, records default to the patient's Baptist Health MyChart account — a patient-friendly, electronic-first approach.
- **Package-based record selection:** The tiered Package 1/Package 2 system with clear descriptions simplifies an inherently complex choice.
- **Toll-free phone support:** Contact information includes both local and toll-free numbers, plus a dedicated MyChart support line.
- **15-day turnaround goal:** Proactively commits to a faster-than-required timeline (HIPAA allows 30 days).
- **Multiple delivery options:** Paper, fax, email, CD, and MyChart cover a wide range of patient preferences.

## Overall Assessment

Baptist Health Lexington, through its parent system, provides a competent but conventional records request process. The primary form is well-organized and clearly accommodates patient self-access, but the reliance on a non-fillable PDF and fax/mail submission keeps this firmly in the traditional paper-workflow category. The existence of a dedicated patient access form (Form 2) shows awareness of the distinction, but its outdated status and missing submission instructions undercut its value. The bright spots — MyChart default delivery, helpful tips page, and clear package descriptions — demonstrate patient-centered thinking within the constraints of a legacy form design.

# AdventHealth Hendersonville — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Hendersonville is a community hospital in western North Carolina, part of the AdventHealth major nonprofit health system. The facility's primary pathway for medical records requests is a **Swellbox/Datavant online eRequest wizard**, linked from a shared system-wide medical records page. No downloadable PDF form specific to AdventHealth Hendersonville exists. The three PDF forms retrieved during the search all belong to other AdventHealth facilities — two from St. Luke's Hospital in Columbus, NC (~40 miles away) and one from Florida Hospital Heartland Division in Sebring, FL.

## Access Pathway Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville's medical records page (accessible via a footer link on the facility homepage) provides phone, fax, and online eRequest options under the "Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina Locations" tab. The **Swellbox/Datavant wizard** at `swellbox.com/adventhealth-mid-wizard.html` is the primary digital pathway for all records requests. This is an online portal approach — a fully digital request workflow that does not require printing, handwriting, or physically delivering a form.

The facility does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the form discovery level; the Swellbox wizard is the single channel for all request types. Whether the wizard itself differentiates internally is unknown from the available materials. Among the sister-facility PDF forms found, form-1 (St. Luke's "Patient Request for Access") does explicitly separate patient self-access from third-party release — but this form is not linked from AdventHealth Hendersonville's pages and belongs to a different facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms for AdventHealth Hendersonville required **moderate effort**. The medical records page was findable through standard website navigation (footer link), and the Swellbox wizard URL was clearly listed. However, multiple web searches for downloadable PDF forms returned only results from sister facilities, and URL-guessing for Hendersonville-specific PDFs returned 404 errors. The shared system-wide medical records page, with its tabbed regional structure, adds a layer of navigation complexity — a patient must identify the correct regional tab and locate their facility within it. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Since no Hendersonville-specific PDF form exists, the best available PDF for assessment is **form-1 (St. Luke's Patient Request for Access)** — a sister facility form from the same Western NC region. This is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) that must be printed and filled by hand. It has a logical top-to-bottom flow covering patient identification, scope selection, format preferences, and delivery method. The language is plain and patient-friendly ("If you would like a copy of your medical record, please complete the form below"). It offers excellent format options (CD, flash drive, email, paper) and delivery methods (mail, secure email, fax, pickup).

However, the form is dated **June 2016**, still uses pre-rebrand "St. Luke's Hospital" branding, includes the Columbus, NC address, and explicitly states "I am a patient of St. Luke's Hospital." A Hendersonville patient using this form would be submitting a request to the wrong facility.

The primary pathway — the Swellbox wizard — is likely a more functional and appropriate tool for Hendersonville patients, but as an external third-party portal, its internal quality could not be assessed from the downloaded materials.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness** required on the sister-facility forms.
- **Fees**: Not mentioned on form-1; form-2 states "A fee may be charged" without specifying amounts; form-3 mentions fees may apply. No fee schedule was found.
- **SSN collection**: Forms request last 4 digits of SSN (form-1 and form-2) or full SSN (form-3), which is unnecessary for patient access.
- **Submission methods**: The Swellbox wizard provides fully online submission. Fax (828-651-4018) and phone (828-681-2135) are also available. No indication that in-person delivery is required.

## Notable Strengths

- **Online portal pathway**: The Swellbox/Datavant wizard offers a fully digital workflow — no printing, scanning, or faxing required.
- **Multiple contact channels**: Phone, fax, and online options are all clearly listed.
- **Sister facility form quality**: Form-1, though not Hendersonville-specific, demonstrates that AdventHealth's regional forms can be well-designed with good format/delivery options.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No facility-specific PDF form**: A patient who prefers or needs a downloadable form has no Hendersonville-specific option.
- **Wrong-facility forms in search results**: PDF forms from other AdventHealth facilities appear in searches, creating confusion risk.
- **Outdated sister-facility forms**: The available PDFs are 7-10 years old with pre-rebrand branding.
- **System-wide page complexity**: The shared medical records page requires patients to navigate regional tabs to find their facility.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville provides an adequate-to-good patient records request experience through its Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, which represents a modern, portal-based approach. The facility scores well on having an electronic submission pathway and multiple contact options. However, the absence of any facility-specific downloadable form, combined with confusing sister-facility PDFs in search results and a somewhat complex system-wide navigation structure, prevents a top-tier rating. The organization's approach is portal-first by design, which works well for digitally comfortable patients but offers no paper-form fallback specific to this facility.

# UPMC Presbyterian — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

UPMC Presbyterian uses the system-wide UPMC "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (form-1.pdf), a two-page PDF hosted on UPMC's Digital Asset Management CDN. Two additional documents were found: an In-Home Urgent Care variant (form-2.pdf) for home-based care services, and an informational guide (form-3.pdf) that walks patients through completing the main form. The primary form relevant to a patient at UPMC Presbyterian requesting their own hospital records is form-1.pdf.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UPMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to physicians, insurers, attorneys, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form used for third-party release, selecting "Personal Use" as the purpose and listing themselves as the recipient. However, UPMC does include a notable inline annotation: **"Purpose is not required for patient access,"** a clear acknowledgment of HIPAA individual access rights that most organizations omit. This partially bridges the gap, but the form's structure — "I authorize UPMC to release information to: [Facility/Person to Receive Records]" — remains fundamentally oriented toward release to third parties. There is no separate patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a MyChart-based records request workflow in the materials reviewed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links on UPMC's CDN. The form is prominently linked from both the system-wide medical records page and the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page. No bot blocking, broken links, or login requirements were encountered. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a **born-digital but print-first PDF**. Despite being created digitally (22 embedded fonts, not a scan), it has essentially no fillable fields — only 1 unnamed interactive field was detected across the entire document. All data entry points use underscore-style blank lines and checkbox squares intended for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit it via mail or fax.

The form is **extremely dense**. Page 1 packs facility selection (14+ UPMC hospitals), patient demographics, recipient information, purpose, disclosure format, delivery method, record type selection (20+ specific document types), sensitive-information opt-outs, expiration terms, and signature blocks onto a single page. While the logical flow is sound (sections labeled A through C), the tight spacing and small text create a visually overwhelming experience. Page 2 contains patient rights and responsibilities disclosures.

The language mixes plain English with legal terminology. Instructions like "Parts 1 and 2 below must be completed" are clear, but fee language and re-disclosure warnings are dense. The 20+ record-type checkboxes offer impressive granularity but may overwhelm patients who simply want "all my records."

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Fee language is ambiguous for patient access.** The form states "charges may be associated with this request" citing Pennsylvania state law, without distinguishing patient access (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) from third-party requests. The phrase "records will be sent upon receipt of payment" could be read as conditioning access on pre-payment.
- **90-day default authorization expiration** is unusually short and may force resubmission if processing is slow, though patients can specify up to one year.
- **No fillable fields** despite born-digital creation is a missed opportunity that forces a paper workflow.
- **Fax delivery restricted to "Providers Only"** — patients cannot receive records by fax, though email and Direct Address are available as electronic delivery alternatives.

## Notable Strengths

- **Companion instruction guide** (form-3.pdf) is a rare patient-friendly resource that explains each section with plain-language examples (e.g., "Inpatient: Admitted for treatment or surgery with overnight stay in hospital").
- **"Purpose is not required for patient access"** — an unusually clear inline acknowledgment of HIPAA rights.
- **Email and Direct Address delivery options** demonstrate awareness of digital access preferences.
- **Anti-conditioning statement** explicitly states UPMC will not condition treatment on signing.
- **Oral authorization provision** for patients physically unable to sign, with two-witness requirements.

## Overall Assessment

UPMC Presbyterian provides an accessible, findable ROI form with some genuinely patient-friendly features — particularly the companion guide and the "purpose not required" note. However, the organization funnels all record requests through a single generic authorization form that was designed for third-party release, lacks interactive form fields despite being born-digital, and uses ambiguous fee language that doesn't clearly distinguish patient access rights. The result is a process that a motivated patient can navigate but that was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. For a major academic health system, the lack of any digital-first submission pathway (online portal, fillable PDF, or web form) is a notable gap.

# Grady Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's major public safety-net hospital operating under Grady Health System, provides patients with a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Three PDF documents were found: a current authorization form (form-1, revised 2/22), an older superseded version (form-2, revised 5/15), and a combined instructions-plus-form package (form-3, bundling the older form with a COVID-era cover page). None of these forms are tailored specifically for patient self-access — all are structured as "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information," framing the process as a release between two parties rather than an individual exercising their right of access.

## Access Pathway

Grady does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting someone else's records. All requesters use the same authorization form with identical "Request Information From" / "Release Information To" fields. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively addressing the form to themselves. The form does include "Personal" as a purpose option, and the documentation requirements section on page 2 distinguishes "Patients Requesting Their Own Medical Records" from third-party requests — but this distinction lives in the supporting text, not in the form design itself. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the main authorization form and the medical records page at gradyhealth.org/medical-records/. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without login, bot blocking, or broken links. The medical records page provides clear context for the forms. This earns high marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the current primary form, is a 2-page digitally-created PDF with a text layer and clean layout. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. For a digitally-created document with 12 embedded fonts, this is a missed opportunity. The form is logically organized (demographics → from/to parties → date range → record types → purpose → format/method → legal notices → signature) with clear section delineation. The record type selection offers approximately 25 checkboxes across three categories (Hospital Visits, Office Visits, Diagnostic Imaging), giving patients granular control.

The language is mostly accessible, with the opening instruction plainly stating what the form does. However, the legal sections contain dense language including a broad liability waiver: "I will not hold Grady... responsible for anything that may happen from the use or release of my PHI." The completeness warning — "If any selection is incomplete, this form may be considered invalid" — could discourage submission if patients are uncertain about any field.

## Submission & Delivery

Critically, **submission options are limited to in-person drop-off and postal mail only**. The form-3 cover page explicitly lists only these two options for submitting the completed form. No fax number is provided for form submission, no email submission is available, and no online portal exists. This means a patient cannot complete the entire process without either physically visiting the hospital or waiting for postal mail.

For *receiving* records, options are better: the current form-1 offers encrypted email delivery, paper, CD, mail, pick-up, and fax (continuing care only). Form-3's cover page also references electronic delivery through CIOX Health (now Datavant), with 2-business-day processing for electronic and 7–10 days for mail.

## Barriers & Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The broad liability waiver bundled into the authorization is the most significant concern — patients should not be asked to waive accountability as a condition of records access. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which exceeds what's needed when photo ID is also required. Mandatory government-issued photo ID may burden patients of a safety-net hospital who lack such documentation.

**Bright spots**: The encrypted email delivery option on form-1 is genuinely uncommon and valuable. The form-3 cover page provides excellent operational guidance — processing timelines, fee disclosure ($6.50 max), and the note that continuing care requests are free. Multiple delivery format options (paper, CD, email) give patients real choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

Grady Memorial Hospital makes its forms easy to find and offers some progressive delivery options, but falls short on two critical dimensions: the forms are entirely paper-based (non-fillable, print-and-handwrite only) and submission requires physical delivery. The generic authorization form does not center patient self-access, and the liability waiver raises compliance concerns. For a major public hospital, the absence of any digital submission pathway and the reliance on a third-party release form for patient access represent meaningful barriers. **Grade: C.**

# EyeSouth Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a practice management organization (PMO) headquartered in Atlanta, GA, operating a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. It is a HIPAA covered entity with a designated Privacy Officer, but the corporate website is entirely partnership-focused with no patient-facing content. Two ROI forms were retrieved — neither from EyeSouth Partners itself, but from individual affiliates: Center for Sight (Florida) and Georgia Retina (Georgia).

## Available Pathways

A patient seeking records from an EyeSouth Partners affiliate faces a fragmented landscape. The parent organization offers no downloadable form, no patient portal, and no records request page. Its privacy policy directs patients to write to the Privacy Officer at corporate headquarters — a mail-only pathway with no form to guide the request. Individual affiliates handle records requests independently: some offer downloadable PDF forms (Center for Sight, Georgia Retina), others use third-party online portals like Sharecare (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye Partners), and at least one has a broken forms page (Georgia Eye Partners, returning 404).

The most relevant forms for patient self-access are the two retrieved PDF forms. **Form 1** (Center for Sight) is a concise, plain-language "Medical Information Release Form" with a patient-friendly tone and 10-business-day processing commitment. **Form 2** (Georgia Retina) is a more detailed "Authorization for Use, Release, or Request of Your Health Information" with HIPAA rights statements but also a $25 fee disclosure and a reason-for-release requirement. Both are one-page, single-purpose authorization forms. Form 1 represents the better patient experience overall and is treated as the primary form for scoring purposes.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to move records "to or from" the affiliated practice. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal right to their own records without needing to provide a reason. The parent organization provides no pathway at all — a patient who only knows they received care "under EyeSouth Partners" would struggle to find any usable process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms required significant effort. Direct searches for "EyeSouth Partners" ROI forms returned nothing. The corporate website has no patient resources section. Forms were located only by identifying specific affiliated practices and searching their individual websites. This multi-step, knowledge-dependent process is a major barrier: a patient must already know which specific practice treated them, find that practice's website, and hope a form is posted there.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms have a text layer (not image-only scans) but **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete by hand. Form 1 uses plain, accessible language with a logical top-down flow (patient info → sender/receiver → date range → reasons → authorization → signature). Its listing of 11 Center for Sight locations with full addresses and fax numbers is dense but functional for identifying where to send the form. Form 2 is more text-dense, with rights disclosures consuming half the page and no visual section headers or dividers. Neither form offers checkboxes for record types, format/delivery options, or electronic submission instructions.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form 1 contains an indefinite authorization ("will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing") with no automatic expiration — potentially problematic under HIPAA § 164.508. Form 2 discloses a flat $25 fee for record reproduction without distinguishing patient access requests (where HIPAA fee limits apply) from third-party releases. Form 2 also asks patients to "list the reason for releasing this information," which HIPAA does not require for patient access. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both imply fax submission is available through listed fax numbers. Form 2 is dated June 2016 — nearly a decade old, predating the HHS Right of Access Initiative and the Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Notable Strengths

- Form 1's 10-business-day processing commitment sets a clear, HIPAA-compliant expectation
- Form 1's warm closing ("we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care") is unusually humanizing
- Both forms are appropriately concise at one page each
- No notarization or witness requirements on either form

## Overall Assessment

EyeSouth Partners presents a below-average patient experience for records access. The fundamental problem is structural: a decentralized PMO with no centralized patient-facing process, forcing patients to navigate affiliate-specific pathways that vary widely in approach and quality. The best available forms are generic authorization documents that don't recognize patient self-access as a distinct use case. While the forms themselves are functional and concise, their paper-first design (no fillable fields), lack of patient rights language, and compliance issues (indefinite authorization, flat fee, reason requirement) prevent them from achieving more than a middling score. The organization earns a **C** grade, reflecting adequate but unexceptional service that requires a patient to work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights.

# Synthesis: Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin

## Overview

Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (GHC-SCW) is a nonprofit, independent physician practice in Madison, WI. It publishes two distinct ROI-related PDF forms, plus a Spanish-language version of one of them, on a well-organized public forms page. Critically, GHC-SCW is one of the relatively rare organizations that offers a **dedicated patient self-access form** separate from its general third-party authorization — a meaningful structural distinction that demonstrates thoughtful process design around patient rights.

## Forms and Pathways

**Form 1** ("Authorization to Release Protected Health Information From GHC-SCW") is a 2-page general HIPAA authorization form oriented toward third-party release. It covers scenarios like transferring care, insurance, disability determinations, and legal use, with "Personal Use" available as one checkbox option. A Spanish version is also published. While usable for patient self-access, the framing, language, and workflow are designed around the third-party release use case.

**Form 2** ("Patient Request for Health Information Form") is a 1-page, fillable PDF designed specifically for patients requesting their own records. This is the primary form for patient self-access and the basis for scoring. It uses plain-English question-based section headers ("What records do you want?", "How would you like your records delivered?"), offers granular record-type checkboxes with date range scoping, and provides multiple delivery options including paper, email (encrypted by default), CD, USB, and MyChart portal delivery.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

GHC-SCW clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release by maintaining two separate forms. Form 2 is purpose-built for the individual access use case, with simpler language, fewer fields, and a patient-centered workflow. This is a best practice that most organizations do not follow — the typical approach is a single generic authorization form that patients must navigate regardless of whether they're requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. The first web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's forms page at ghcscw.com/members/forms/ is cleanly organized with a "Release of Information Forms" section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA were encountered. One minor quirk: Form 2 was listed under "Health Insurance Forms" rather than "Release of Information Forms," which could cause a patient browsing specifically for ROI forms to miss the more patient-friendly option.

## Form Document Quality

Form 2 is technically excellent: a fully fillable PDF with 49 interactive fields on a single page. The layout is clean and logically ordered (demographics → record selection → delivery method → recipient → signature). The language is accessible and avoids legalese. The form explicitly references the patient's HIPAA right of access and sets a transparent processing timeline of 5 business days.

Form 1, by contrast, has zero fillable fields despite being digitally authored, and explicitly prohibits electronic signatures — creating a print-sign-scan workflow that undermines electronic submission. However, since Form 2 is the primary patient access pathway and is fully fillable, the organization's overall technical accessibility is strong.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: Form 2 states "There may be charges associated with processing a request" without specifying amounts. The notes mention CIOX Health as the ROI vendor and note that "CIOX requires payment for medical records." Fee vagueness leaves patients unable to anticipate costs, and the CIOX involvement raises questions about whether fees are limited to HIPAA's cost-based standard for patient access.

**Submission instructions gap**: Form 2 lacks any indication of where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email. Patients must refer to Form 1 or the website for submission details. Form 1 provides mail, fax (608-441-3499), email (ghcroi@ghcscw.com), and in-person drop-off as options.

**No notarization or witness required**. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a genuine best practice
- **Fully fillable PDF** with 49 interactive fields on one concise page
- **Multiple delivery formats**: paper, encrypted email, CD, USB, MyChart portal
- **Encrypted email as default** with opt-in for unencrypted — privacy by design
- **Spanish-language version** of Form 1 available
- **Plain-language, question-based headers** make the form approachable
- **Transparent processing timeline** (5 business days)

## Overall Assessment

GHC-SCW demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by maintaining a dedicated, well-designed patient access form that is technically fillable, concisely written, and offers flexible delivery options including portal-based delivery. The main weaknesses are the vague fee disclosure, the absence of submission instructions on Form 2 itself, and the use of CIOX Health as the ROI vendor (which may introduce fee concerns). Despite these gaps, the organization's approach to patient record access is meaningfully above average and reflects intentional design around patient rights.

# Northwest Colorado Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Northwest Colorado Health is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms on its website: one for behavioral health records (form-1) and one for medical/dental records (form-2). Both are single-page PDFs available from a dedicated patient forms page. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient-access form — both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any release of information, whether to the patient themselves or to a third party.

## Access Pathway

Northwest Colorado Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Request Information FROM" / "Release Information TO" structure, treating a patient requesting their own records identically to someone authorizing release to an insurer, attorney, or another provider. The "Release Information TO" section does list "Self / Legal Guardian" as a pre-printed option, which at least acknowledges that patients may be the intended recipient, but the form's structure, legal language, and scope options are all oriented toward the general authorization use case.

Patients who received both medical and behavioral health services at this facility would need to complete **two separate forms** — a meaningful friction point not faced by those seeking release to a single third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped web search located the patient forms page at a logical URL path (`/what_you_can_do/patient-resources/patient-forms/english.html`). Both forms were publicly linked, downloadable without authentication, and no bot-blocking or CAPTCHA was encountered. The download URLs are GUID-based and not human-readable, but this is a minor cosmetic issue.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form for patient self-access is form-2 (Medical and/or Dental), as it covers the broadest category of records most patients would seek. Key observations:

- **Fillability:** Despite metadata reporting 43 field annotations, the form is functionally a flat PDF — not practically fillable. Patients must print and complete by hand.
- **Length:** A single page, which is commendably concise. However, this compresses a substantial amount of content into a tight layout.
- **Language:** The introductory paragraph is notably patient-friendly: "We value your privacy at Northwest Colorado Health. Legally, we cannot release your written health record to anyone (including you) without your specific consent." The tone shifts to denser legal language in the six numbered disclaimers but remains reasonably readable.
- **Layout:** Logically organized with clear sections — patient info, FROM/TO entities, record types, purpose, sensitive-information authorization, signature, and legal paragraphs. Checkbox-driven options for record types and disclosure purposes reduce writing burden.
- **Instructions:** The form provides adequate contextual guidance but lacks explicit step-by-step instructions. Critically, it provides **no submission instructions** — a patient who downloads and completes the form has no guidance on where or how to send it (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link for submission).

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection:** Both forms request the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for identity verification under HIPAA and creates a data security risk.
- **No submission method stated:** The absence of submission instructions is a significant barrier. The Privacy Officer's mailing address appears only in the revocation clause, not as a submission destination.
- **No fee disclosure:** The forms neither mention fees nor state that patient access is free, leaving cost ambiguity.
- **Legacy organization name:** The revocation section refers to "Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association," the organization's former name, which could confuse patients despite the form's 04/2020 revision date.

## Bright Spots

- **Fast processing commitment:** "Up to 48 business hours" (~6 business days) is well within HIPAA's 30-day window and more specific and faster than most organizations promise.
- **Plain-language introduction:** The opening paragraph is warm, clear, and patient-friendly — significantly better than the legalistic openings common on ROI forms.
- **Photocopy validity:** The form states that photocopies are as valid as originals, reducing barriers for patients.
- **Non-retaliation statement:** Clearly states that care and payment will not be affected by declining to sign.
- **Easy findability:** Forms are publicly accessible without login or barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Northwest Colorado Health provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find, concise, and written with an unusually patient-friendly tone. However, the organization funnels all requests through a generic authorization form with no differentiation for patient self-access, collects unnecessary SSNs, provides no submission instructions, and offers only a print-and-handwrite workflow. The split into two separate forms by record category adds friction for patients. This is a typical small independent FQHC approach — adequate but not designed with the patient's individual access rights as a first-class concern.

# WellSpan York Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

WellSpan York Hospital is part of WellSpan Health, a regional nonprofit health system in Pennsylvania. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms at the system level on wellspan.org. **Form-1.pdf** ("Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information," Form #2606, Rev. 08/25) is the primary system-wide form applicable to York Hospital and all other WellSpan facilities. **Form-2.pdf** ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information") is scoped exclusively to three WellSpan neighborhood hospitals (Newberry, Shrewsbury, Carlisle) and does not apply to York Hospital. The assessment below focuses on form-1.pdf as the relevant patient pathway.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WellSpan does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form or pathway distinct from third-party release. Form-1.pdf is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization with a bidirectional "Obtain from" / "Disclose to" structure designed for third-party transfers. However, the form does include a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an unusually clear statement of the right to self-access: *"I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."* This language partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated pathway, but a patient must still navigate a form framed around releasing records to another party and figure out how to adapt it for self-access (e.g., writing their own name in the "Disclose to" field).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A straightforward web search immediately returned a direct PDF link on wellspan.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. Multiple search strategies all converged on the same document. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1.pdf is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a complete text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally created, all fields are blank underscored lines, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient identification flows into record source/destination, then record type selection, purpose, delivery format, sensitive-records disclosure, legal terms, signatures, and submission instructions. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records paragraph on page 1 is a dense run-on sentence that could benefit from formatting improvements.

Record type options are well structured with five top-level categories (Abstract with detailed sub-list, Diagnostic Test Results, Imaging, Billing, and Complete record). Delivery format options are a standout feature: patients can choose Paper, CD, Fax, or Email, where the email option delivers records through a secure portal as PDFs available for 30 days.

## Barriers & Compliance

The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's SSN — an unnecessary data collection practice that introduces privacy risk without being required for patient identification. A witness signature line on page 2 creates ambiguity about whether a witness is routinely required or only for specific circumstances. Fees are mentioned as "regulated by state and federal law" but no specific amounts are disclosed. Notably, form processing is handled by MRO Corporation, a third-party ROI vendor, meaning patients interact with MRO rather than WellSpan directly.

On the positive side: the form explicitly accepts copies in lieu of originals, does not require notarization, and clearly states that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing. The 12-month authorization window is reasonable.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit the completed form via **fax** (717-812-8119), **email** (PatientRequests@wellspan.org), or **mail** to the York, PA HIM office. The availability of fax and email means patients are not required to physically visit the facility or rely solely on postal mail.

## Overall Assessment

WellSpan York Hospital provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed authorization form with modern delivery options (secure portal) and explicit right-to-self language. However, the absence of fillable fields in a born-digital PDF, the generic third-party authorization structure, the SSN collection, and witness ambiguity prevent it from reaching the top tier. The organization serves patients adequately but has clear room for improvement in both digital accessibility and patient-centered design.

# Shannon Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Shannon Health, a nonprofit regional health system in San Angelo, TX, provides a single Authorization for Release of Information (ROI) form for all records requests. The form is available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful accommodation for the area's large Hispanic population. While the form is easy to find and includes several patient-friendly features, it follows the common pattern of routing patient self-access requests through a generic third-party release authorization rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Forms & Pathways

Shannon Health offers two downloaded documents, but they are functionally one form in two languages:

- **form-1.pdf** (English): "Authorization for Release of Information," revised 06/2024
- **form-2.pdf** (Spanish): "Autorización para la Divulgación de Información," identical structure

The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-1.pdf (English). The form includes a "Self" checkbox under the recipient field and "Personal Use" among purpose options, acknowledging patient access as a use case. However, the form's structure — with fields for recipient organization, address, phone, fax, and relationship — assumes a third-party release scenario. A patient requesting their own records must navigate these irrelevant fields, with no guidance on how to handle them when "Self" is selected.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal for record requests, and no separate streamlined process for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The website's navigation path — **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** — leads directly to a page with clearly labeled download links for both language versions. This is a 2-click path from the homepage. One minor friction point: web search results initially returned outdated URLs (`medical-record-authorization.pdf`) that produced 404 errors. The filenames were updated for 2025 without redirects, creating link rot. Navigating the website directly resolved this.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores for handwriting; no checkboxes are interactive. For a form dated 2025, this is a significant missed opportunity. Patients must print the PDF, hand-fill all fields, then scan or photograph it for electronic submission.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → substance use disorder options → format → legal terms → signature → return instructions. The flow is intuitive, and the form uses reasonably clear language, though page 2's legal disclosures are denser. The form provides granular control over record scope with approximately 15 record type checkboxes, a date range field, and hospital/clinic selection. The three-option handling of substance use disorder records (include all, exclude all, select specific) is well-designed.

Approximately 25 fields require completion, which is proportionate for a general-purpose ROI form but more than a dedicated patient access form would need.

## Barriers

**Fees**: The form states fees "may" be charged and requires the patient to "agree to pay accordingly" — without disclosing amounts or referencing applicable fee limits. This vague blanket acceptance is the most significant concern; a patient has no idea what they're agreeing to.

**No notarization or witness** required. **No in-person submission** required — email is explicitly listed as the "Preferred Method" via `ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org`. Mail and in-person delivery are also available. No fax submission is listed, but email more than compensates.

**Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) linked side-by-side on the records page — appropriate for San Angelo's demographics (~45% Hispanic)
- **Email as the preferred submission method** — unusually patient-friendly; most orgs default to fax or mail
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: MyChart portal access and encrypted email via ShareFile, in addition to paper, CD, pick-up, and mail
- **Non-conditioning disclosure**: Explicitly states Shannon cannot condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on signing the authorization — an important HIPAA protection many forms omit
- **Substance use disorder records handling**: Three clear options giving patients granular control over sensitive information

## Overall Assessment

Shannon Health delivers an above-average but not exceptional patient experience. The form is easy to find, reasonably well-designed, and submitted through a patient-friendly email channel. The bilingual offering and electronic delivery options are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (funneling patients through a generic third-party authorization), the absence of fillable fields in a 2025-edition form, and the vague fee disclosure prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process wasn't designed with that use case as the primary concern.

# Coast Plaza Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Coast Plaza Hospital provides two versions of the same "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form on its Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`). Form-1 (June 2024, labeled "FINAL") is the current version; form-2 (January 2022) remains publicly accessible alongside it with no indication of which is current. Both are general-purpose ROI authorization forms — not patient-access-specific documents. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is to download form-1, print and hand-fill it, and fax or mail it to the hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Coast Plaza Hospital does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms use a single "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" workflow. The "Information to be Released to" section asks for "Name of Hospital/Clinic/Physician/Person," framing the recipient as a third party. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in this field, which is unintuitive. While "Personal Use" appears as a purpose option and "Records for Personal Use" as a record-type checkbox, the relationship between these is ambiguous — it's unclear whether selecting one, the other, or both is needed. The form lacks any Right of Access language or statement of patient rights beyond standard authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Multiple search strategies succeeded: a filetype:pdf web search and a site-scoped search both led to the hospital's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering was required. Both PDFs downloaded directly with curl. The only findability concern is the co-existence of two versions without clear versioning — a patient could easily download the outdated 2022 form, which lists a different fax number that may no longer be monitored.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created 2-page PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All ~20+ data entry points (patient name, address, DOB, phone, email, recipient information, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, date range, delivery method, signature) must be completed by hand after printing. The layout is well-organized with bold section headers ("Patient Information," "Information to be Released From," etc.) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. Record types are arranged efficiently in two columns with 16+ individual categories. The language is moderately legalistic — first-person authorization statements are standard but dense. A "PATIENT LABEL" box on both pages is a clinical workflow artifact that may confuse patients completing the form at home.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No fillable fields**: Forces a fully paper-based completion workflow in a form that was digitally designed and could easily support interactive fields.
- **CD-only electronic delivery**: The only electronic format option is CD — functionally obsolete in 2024. No email, portal, or secure download option exists.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "I understand that there may be a fee associated with this request" provides no fee amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee standard, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not tell patients where to send the completed authorization. The hospital's fax number appears in the "Released From" section but is not framed as a return destination.
- **Outdated form still online**: The 2022 version with a different fax number remains downloadable, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record selection**: 16+ specific record types give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **Sensitive category separation**: Mental Health, Genetic Testing, Alcohol/Drug Abuse, and HIV/AIDS records require separate initialing — correctly implementing federal and state requirements.
- **Encryption preference**: The form asks whether patients want records encrypted, a privacy-conscious option rarely seen on ROI forms.
- **No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature.

## Overall Assessment

Coast Plaza Hospital provides a findable, reasonably organized generic ROI form that a patient *can* use for self-access, but the experience is clearly not designed around patient needs. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, CD-only electronic delivery, and generic third-party framing all reflect a process built for institutional convenience rather than patient empowerment. The form earns credit for easy findability, granular record selection, and proper handling of sensitive categories, but falls short on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness.

# Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital is a critical access hospital in Miller, SD, part of the Avera Health regional nonprofit system. The facility does not publish its own ROI form; instead, patients use Avera Health's system-wide "Authorization – Release Of Medical Records Information" form (Form 8691-04). Only one form was found applicable to this facility.

## Pathway Assessment: Generic Third-Party Authorization

The sole available form is a **general-purpose HIPAA authorization** designed for disclosure of records between any two parties. It does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third party (attorney, insurer, other provider) requesting records with patient authorization. The form's structure — with separate "Provider (Who is releasing information?)" and "Disclose Information to (Where is information to be sent?)" sections — frames the transaction as a release between entities, not as a patient exercising individual access rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524).

There is no dedicated patient access form, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no simplified workflow for self-access. A patient wanting their own records must complete the same authorization form as a third-party requester, filling in themselves as the recipient. The form does reference 45 CFR 164.524 in its authorization block, acknowledging the right to inspect or obtain copies, but this is buried in legal boilerplate rather than presented as a primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The Hand County facility profile page on avera.org does not link directly to any medical records form. A patient would need to navigate to Avera Health's system-level "Request Medical Records" page or perform a web search. Additionally, Avera's website **blocks automated downloads** (curl/wget return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. The form URL is descriptively named, which is a minor positive.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally generated PDF** with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, making it a print-and-handwrite document. Patients must print, fill by hand, and submit via fax or mail. The layout uses labeled left-margin sections (Patient Identification, Provider, Disclose Information to, etc.) which provide reasonable navigation, but fitting all content onto one page results in a visually dense, cramped document. The language mixes moderately plain English with regulatory references (42 CFR Part 2, 45 CFR 164.524) and HIV/AIDS disclosure warnings — functional but not optimized for patient readability.

The form asks for approximately 15–18 discrete fields including patient demographics, provider information, recipient information, record type checkboxes, date ranges, format preferences, purpose, expiration date, and signature. This is a moderate field count for an authorization form, though several fields (provider address, recipient fax) add complexity that a patient self-access form would not need.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and may deter privacy-conscious patients.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" field is present without clarification of whether it is required or optional. If interpreted as mandatory, this creates an unnecessary barrier.
- **No submission instructions on form**: The form does not print a mailing address or designate the fax number as a submission destination; the Avera fax number (605-322-8200) appears only in the context of "questions about disclosure."
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Charges may apply" for entire record requests with no fee schedule or amounts provided.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: The form offers paper, fax, flash drive, CD-ROM, and email — with encryption by default and an explicit opt-out for unencrypted delivery. This is a notably comprehensive set of format choices.
- **45 CFR 164.524 citation**: Explicit reference to the HIPAA Right of Access provision signals regulatory awareness.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Covering all required elements on one page reduces printing burden.

## Overall Assessment

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital provides a functional but **generic, third-party-oriented** pathway for records access. The form is adequate for its purpose as a system-wide authorization but does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, SSN collection, and ambiguous witness requirement create friction. The strong delivery format options and 45 CFR 164.524 reference are bright spots, but the overall experience reflects an organization that has not optimized for patient-initiated access requests.

# ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

ENT & Allergy Associates is a large for-profit physician practice with 80+ offices across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Despite its size, the organization provides one of the poorest records-request experiences in this study. The sole ROI form is a 17-year-old Microsoft Word document buried on the website with no visible link, no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no pathway designed for patients requesting their own records.

## Forms & Pathways

Two documents were retrieved:

1. **form-1.pdf** (the ROI form): "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA" — a 2-page generic third-party release authorization. Originally a `.doc` file created in 2009, converted to PDF for this study. This is the only records-release mechanism available.
2. **form-2.pdf** (not an ROI form): "Patient Acknowledgment Form – Allergy Form Completion Fee" — a $25 fee acknowledgment for physician form completion (school/activity clearance). Found in the footer under the misleading label "Allergy Authorization Form."

There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The only pathway is downloading a Word document and figuring out independently how to submit it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for releasing records to a named third party. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in Item 8 ("Name and address of person(s) or category of person to whom this information will be sent"), which is unintuitive and not explained anywhere. The form contains no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights statement specific to individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient may simply want to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was exceptionally difficult. The website has no "Patient Forms," "Medical Records," or "Request Your Records" section. The FAQ mentions medical records only in the context of retention policies. The footer link labeled "Allergy Authorization Form" leads to the fee acknowledgment (form-2), not the ROI form. The actual ROI form exists at an orphaned URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) not linked from any navigable page — it was only discoverable through a targeted `filetype:doc` web search. A patient browsing the website would have no path to this form.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a Word `.doc` file with zero fillable fields, requiring patients to either print and handwrite or type into the Word template. The layout uses a numbered list but lacks visual hierarchy — no section headers, minimal bold, and no section dividers. Language is moderately dense legalese with constructions like "except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization." Item 6 is entirely in ALL-CAPS and contains a typo ("THEN" instead of "THE"). The form collects approximately 12–15 pieces of information, including the patient's Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection point that creates a privacy risk.

## Barriers & Red Flags

- **No submission instructions whatsoever.** The form provides no address, fax number, email, or portal link. A patient who manages to find and complete it has no guidance on how to return it.
- **SSN requested.** Unnecessary for identity verification in records requests and a data security risk.
- **Severely outdated.** Last modified January 2009 — predates the HITECH Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the ONC Information Blocking Rule.
- **Confusing Item 6.** The ALL-CAPS restriction on discussing health information could be read to limit the provider's ability to discuss records even with the patient themselves.

## Bright Spots

- **Proper handling of sensitive categories.** The form correctly requires separate initialing for HIV, substance abuse, and mental health records, with anti-redisclosure language and civil rights contact information per NY/NJ state law.
- **Anti-conditioning statement.** Item 4 clearly states treatment and benefits will not be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

ENT & Allergy Associates presents a deeply patient-unfriendly records request experience. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, an outdated Word document format, zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no patient-access-specific pathway means that a patient attempting to request their records online would face barriers at every step. For a practice of this size and market presence, this represents a significant gap in patient-centered service. **Grade: D.**

# Community Health Center of Central Missouri — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Community Health Center of Central Missouri (CHCCMO), an independent nonprofit FQHC with four clinic locations across central Missouri, publishes a single general-purpose ROI form — an "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." Two versions were found: a current 2025 update (form-1) and a superseded 2023 version (form-2). Both are hosted as publicly accessible WordPress uploads on chccmo.org. There is no online portal, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no dedicated patient access form. The PDF form, submitted by fax, mail, email, or in-person pickup, is the only pathway.

## Access Pathway: No Individual Access Differentiation

CHCCMO does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party release. Both versions use a generic FROM/TO routing structure designed for provider-to-provider transfers. The 2025 form asks patients to specify "Please send my records FROM" and "Please send my records TO," with checkboxes for CHCCMO or "Other" at each end. A patient wanting their own records must navigate this structure, filling in their personal information in the TO field — a workflow clearly designed for transfers between entities, not for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). Neither form references HIPAA, the Right of Access, or patient access rights beyond a brief acknowledgment section.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **trivially easy**. A standard web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No site navigation, bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The filename (`Release-of-Records-updated-2025.pdf`) is descriptive. However, the older 2023 version remains publicly accessible at a different URL with no indication it is superseded, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The 2025 form (form-1) is the primary document and represents the organization's current offering. It is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite all entries. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → sender/receiver routing → delivery method → record types → date range → purpose → acknowledgment → signature. However, the page is densely packed, and the multi-column layout in the record type and purpose sections may fragment reading order. The acknowledgment section is a single dense paragraph of legal boilerplate rather than numbered, digestible points.

Positive document features include email as a delivery option (alongside fax, mail, and pickup), preset date range options ("Last 12 months" / "Last 24 months"), and a comprehensive list of 10 named record categories. The form is concise at one page. However, it contains a misspelled heading ("AKNOWLEDGEMENT") and inconsistent ZIP codes between the form body and footer (65101 vs. 65110).

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate. This creates a procedural barrier, particularly for patients completing the form at home. The sensitive records clause bundles all sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing) into a single all-or-nothing authorization without granular opt-in/opt-out, which may conflict with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records. The 2025 form does not mention fees, leaving the cost question ambiguous; the older 2023 version references potential copying costs. No notarization is required. Submission can be done via fax or email, so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: Extremely easy findability; concise one-page form; email as a delivery option (uncommon among ROI forms); preset date range options reduce friction; comprehensive record type selection; non-conditioning and revocation language included.

**Weaknesses**: No dedicated patient access pathway — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization form; no fillable PDF fields despite being digitally created; witness requirement adds unnecessary friction; sensitive records bundling; typos and address inconsistencies in the form; no HIPAA Right of Access language; no response time commitment in the 2025 version (the 2023 version mentions 30 days).

## Overall Assessment

CHCCMO makes its ROI form easy to find and keeps it concise, but the form itself reflects a provider-centric rather than patient-centric design philosophy. It treats all records requests — whether from patients, insurers, attorneys, or other providers — identically through a generic authorization form. The lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, and the absence of any Right of Access language mean that a patient requesting their own records faces unnecessary friction and receives no acknowledgment that this is a right, not a favor. The organization earns credit for easy findability and electronic submission options, but falls short on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and compliance hygiene.

# Alabama Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Alabama Medical Group, P.C. is an independent, for-profit, multi-specialty physician practice based in Mobile, Alabama. The organization maintains a well-organized website with a dedicated Patient Resources section, including a clearly labeled "Request Medical Records" page. Two forms were found and evaluated: a general-purpose "Request for Release of Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a narrow "Permission to Give Medical Information" form (form-2.pdf) for authorizing family phone access. Only form-1 is relevant for a patient seeking their own records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Third-Party Authorization

Alabama Medical Group does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-1, a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form titled "Request for Release of Information." The form is structured around "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" fields — language designed for inter-provider and third-party transfers, not for a patient requesting their own records. A patient would need to place their own name and address in the "Release To" field, which is workable but not intuitive.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access anywhere on the form. The form frames the entire interaction as consent-to-release rather than as an exercise of a legal right. The purpose checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Evaluation & Treatment, Other) further confirm this is designed for third-party scenarios — a patient requesting their own records would likely select "Other" and write in an explanation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The website is well-organized with a clear path: Patient Resources → Medical Records → Request Medical Records. The form is linked directly from that page as a PDF download. The same form also appears on the "Other Patient Forms" page. No bot blocking, no browser fallback needed, and no significant difficulties were encountered. The duplicate hosting (identical file at two URLs uploaded one month apart) is a minor organizational issue but does not impair access.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but **no fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects patient name (including maiden name), date of birth, Social Security Number, medical record number, recipient/source information with address/phone/fax, purpose, type of information (free-text), sensitive information consent, and multiple signature lines. The field count is approximately 15–18 data points.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow and fits on one page, though this density makes it somewhat cramped. Language is a mix of plain English for identification fields and standard legal boilerplate for the authorization terms. The example prompt for specifying record type — "(Example: Office Notes, Labs, In-Office Testing, all records)" — is a helpful touch. The dual signature block for sensitive information consent (specifically permitting vs. specifically not permitting) gives patients clear control.

However, the form lacks submission instructions — no mailing address, fax number, or email address is printed on it. A patient who downloads the PDF would not know how to return it without navigating back to the website or calling the office. There is also no date range field, no delivery format options, and no mention of electronic delivery.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests a Social Security Number as a standard field, which is unnecessary for a medical records request and creates an identity theft risk. The **employee/witness signature line** at the bottom is ambiguous — if required, it would effectively mandate in-person submission, a significant barrier not required by HIPAA. **No fees are mentioned** on the form, which leaves uncertainty about costs. **No response time** is stated.

The form was uploaded in February 2018 and has apparently not been updated since, suggesting the organization has not revisited its records request process in approximately eight years.

## Notable Strengths

- Easy findability with clear website navigation
- Concise one-page form
- Helpful example text for record type specification
- Clean sensitive information consent design with explicit opt-in/opt-out

## Overall Assessment

Alabama Medical Group provides a **functional but dated** records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it funnels patients through a generic third-party release authorization with no acknowledgment of patient access rights. The flat PDF with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no electronic submission pathway creates a primarily paper-based workflow. The SSN collection and ambiguous witness requirement are concerning. This is a practice that has not modernized its records access process to reflect current patient expectations or HIPAA right-of-access principles.
