# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 0 Findings

## Summary

Across 190 organizations with scored data, **75% (142 orgs) offer only a generic HIPAA authorization form** — designed for third-party release of information — as the primary mechanism for patients requesting their own records. Just **12% (22 orgs) provide a dedicated patient access form** aligned with HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524. Another 10% (19 orgs) route patients to an online portal, and 4% (7 orgs) have no online pathway at all.

## Classification Breakdown

| Pathway Type | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 142 | 75% |
| Dedicated patient access form | 22 | 12% |
| Online portal (third-party vendor) | 19 | 10% |
| Phone/in-person only | 7 | 4% |

Of the 142 generic-form orgs, only 9 (6%) make any attempt to differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — for example, by including a "Myself" checkbox or a conditional "if released to self" section. The remaining **133 orgs (70% of all studied)** treat a patient requesting their own records identically to a lawyer or insurance company requesting them.

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

A patient walking into the generic HIPAA authorization workflow encounters several concrete problems:

**Wrong framing.** The form asks "who should we release your records *to*?" — forcing the patient to write their own name as the recipient. At Abbeville Area Medical Center, the patient must list themselves under "Name/Facility" in a field designed for external organizations. The entire document is framed around *authorizing disclosure to a third party*, not exercising a personal right.

**Unnecessary fields.** Generic forms typically require a recipient name, address, and relationship — fields that are meaningless for self-access. Several orgs (including Addabbo Family Health Center and Guthrie Corning Hospital) collect Social Security Numbers, adding privacy risk for a transaction that shouldn't require them.

**Legalistic language.** The authorization paradigm uses distancing phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" (Guthrie) rather than patient-centered language like "I am requesting my own records." The Addabbo form uses New York's OCA Form 960, which was originally designed for litigation and explicitly says so in its instructions.

**Missing rights information.** Generic forms virtually never reference the patient's right of access, HIPAA's 30-day response requirement, fee limits, or format options (electronic, paper). These rights exist regardless of the form used, but patients don't learn about them through the authorization workflow.

**No delivery options.** Dedicated patient access forms typically offer multiple delivery methods (email, portal, mail, CD, USB). Generic forms rarely do — they collect a recipient address and leave it at that.

## What Good Looks Like

The 22 orgs with dedicated patient access forms demonstrate the contrast clearly. **Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital** (Advocate Health system) maintains a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form with "Myself" as the first recipient option and a portal callout at the top. **Huntington Hospital** (Northwell Health) cites HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524 on its form, offers 7 delivery methods including secure email and USB drive, and provides 28 fillable fields. **Intermountain Medical Center** has a fillable PDF form specifically titled for patient requests.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Major health systems are far more likely to offer a dedicated form: **23% of major-system-affiliated orgs** have one, versus just **6% of independent and regional-system orgs**. This likely reflects the compliance resources available to large systems. By facility type, community hospitals lead (14 of 22 dedicated forms), while critical access hospitals almost never differentiate (1 of 28). No clear regional pattern emerges — the problem is nationwide.

## The Systemic Issue

Three-quarters of U.S. healthcare organizations studied give patients a form designed for someone *else* to request *their* records. This is not a minor formatting issue — it reflects a fundamental confusion between HIPAA § 164.508 (authorization for third-party disclosure) and § 164.524 (individual right of access). The patient's right of access requires no authorization at all; the patient is not "authorizing" anything, they are *exercising a right*. Yet the dominant workflow forces them into an authorization paradigm, creating unnecessary confusion, collecting irrelevant information, and obscuring the rights that HIPAA guarantees.
