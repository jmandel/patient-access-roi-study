# The Wrong Form Problem — Batch 0 Analysis

## Classification Summary

Of the **68 organizations** in this batch, the vast majority funnel patients requesting their own records through a generic third-party HIPAA authorization form rather than offering a pathway designed for individual access under § 164.524.

| Classification | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| **Generic only** | 59 | 87% |
| **Both** (dedicated + generic) | 5 | 7% |
| **Dedicated** patient access form | 2 | 3% |
| **Portal-only** (no downloadable form) | 2 | 3% |
| **Not determined** | 0 | 0% |

### Organizations with Dedicated Patient Access Forms

**BOTH** (separate forms for self-access and third-party release): Erlanger Health System, GHC of South Central Wisconsin, Intermountain Medical Center, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center, The Baton Rouge Clinic.

**DEDICATED** (primary form is patient-access-oriented): Merit Health Central, Wayne County Hospital.

**PORTAL-ONLY**: AdventHealth Hendersonville, HopeHealth.

The remaining **59 organizations** (87%) offer only a generic HIPAA authorization form.

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

The generic authorization form is designed for a three-party transaction: a patient authorizes Provider A to release records *to* Party B (an insurer, attorney, or another provider). When a patient wants their *own* records, this framework creates several concrete mismatches:

**Nonsensical recipient fields.** The most universal problem. Forms ask patients to fill in a "Release To" or "Disclose To" recipient with fields for organization name, address, phone, and fax — all designed for an external entity. A patient must awkwardly write their own name and home address in fields labeled "Name of Physician/Organization" (Arizona Community Physicians), "Facility's name" (Fenway Health), or "Name of Hospital/Clinic/Physician/Person" (Coast Plaza Hospital). At Cone Health, the patient must "effectively name themselves as the recipient of their own information." This is not merely confusing — it signals that the form was not designed for them.

**Mandatory purpose fields.** Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not justify their request. Yet generic forms routinely require a "Purpose of Release" or "Reason for Request" without indicating it's optional for self-access. Copley Hospital, Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola (where purpose is marked "REQUIRED"), and OSU Wexner Medical Center all impose this. Only a handful of organizations — Vanderbilt ("only required if not for your personal use"), UPMC Presbyterian ("Purpose is not required for patient access"), and Baptist Health Lexington ("not required if being disclosed directly to patient") — flag the distinction.

**Wrong legal framework.** A § 164.508 authorization is legally distinct from a § 164.524 access request: different fee rules, different timelines, different patient rights. By routing self-access through an authorization form, organizations obscure these distinctions. Patients encounter authorization expiration dates (Avera's 90-day, Duly's 90-day, Cuba Memorial's 90-day) that are legally unnecessary for access requests, fee language that doesn't acknowledge HIPAA's cost-based cap, and liability waivers (OrthoCarolina, Grady Memorial, Desert Valley Hospital) that have no place in a patient access interaction.

**Witness and ID requirements bleed over.** Duly Health and Care requires a witness signature for "Personal Reasons" requests — a barrier HIPAA does not impose for patient access. Troy Regional Medical Center bundles a liability waiver and an "all fields MUST be completed or authorization is invalid" warning. Lakeland Regional Health includes an ambiguous witness line. These requirements, designed for the legal formality of third-party authorization, create unnecessary friction when applied to self-access.

## What Good Looks Like — By Contrast

The seven organizations offering dedicated forms demonstrate a different design philosophy. Intermountain's "Patient Request for Health Information" uses question-based headers ("What records do you want?"), defaults to "Self" as recipient, and has 48 fillable fields on a single page. GHC-SCW's patient form uses plain-English headers, offers encrypted email as the default delivery, and explicitly cites the HIPAA right of access. Providence Sacred Heart titles its form "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — correct HIPAA terminology that frames the interaction as a right, not a favor. Merit Health Central's form leads with "Myself" as the first recipient option and provides five delivery methods including password-protected removable media.

These forms share common traits: they eliminate irrelevant third-party fields, drop the purpose requirement, use first-person patient-directed language, and offer format/delivery choices — all features that generic authorization forms systematically lack.

## The Scale of the Problem

With 87% of organizations in this batch using only a generic form, the wrong-form problem is not an edge case — it is the default. A patient at nearly nine out of ten organizations will encounter a form that treats their legal right to their own records as indistinguishable from an attorney requesting records for litigation. The patient experience consequences — confusion about which fields apply, uncertainty about fees and timelines, and the implicit message that self-access is an afterthought — are baked into the design of the most common records request pathway in American healthcare.
