# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 11 Analysis

## Classification Summary

Across 190 organizations with synthesis data, access pathways break down as follows:

| Pathway Type | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only (no differentiation) | 133 | 70% |
| Generic HIPAA authorization with some self-access differentiation | 9 | 5% |
| Dedicated patient access form | 22 | 12% |
| Online portal (third-party vendor) | 19 | 10% |
| Phone/in-person only (no online pathway) | 7 | 4% |

Fully **75% of organizations** (142/190) offer only a generic third-party authorization form as the primary mechanism for patients requesting their own records. Only 9 of those 142 make any attempt to differentiate self-access — typically a "Myself" checkbox buried among other recipient options. The remaining 133 orgs (70% of the total) treat a patient exercising their Right of Access identically to a lawyer or insurer requesting records.

## What Makes Generic Forms a Poor Fit

Patients using a generic authorization for self-access encounter several concrete problems:

**Wrong conceptual framing.** The form asks "who should we release your records *to*?" — forcing patients to write their own name as the recipient. At Abbeville Area Medical Center, the patient must list themselves under "Name/Facility" in a field designed for external organizations. At Consensus Health, the form's language ("authorize the disclosure of information from my health record" to a named "Person/Organization/Facility") assumes records are being sent to someone other than the patient. The entire document is built around *authorizing disclosure to a third party*, not exercising a personal right.

**Unnecessary and risky fields.** Among the 133 generic-only orgs without self-access differentiation, 38 (29%) collect Social Security Numbers — unnecessary for patient self-access and a meaningful identity theft risk on forms typically submitted by fax. Guthrie Corning Hospital requests the last 4 digits of SSN on a non-fillable form that must be faxed. Addabbo Family Health Center uses New York's OCA Form 960, which collects full SSN and was originally designed for litigation.

**Witness/notarization barriers.** 25 generic-only orgs (19%) include witness signature requirements. Abbeville Area Medical Center requires *two* witness signatures — far beyond anything HIPAA mandates for patient self-access. Bath Community Hospital and Colquitt Regional Medical Center include ambiguous witness lines that may deter patients completing forms at home.

**Legalistic language.** Generic forms use distancing phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" (Guthrie) rather than patient-centered language. Addabbo's OCA 960 opens with six numbered legal disclosures — including HIV redisclosure warnings and all-caps restrictions on discussing health information — before any fillable fields appear.

**Missing rights information.** Generic forms virtually never reference the patient's right of access, HIPAA's 30-day response requirement, fee limits, or format options. These rights exist regardless of the form used, but patients don't learn about them through the authorization workflow.

## What Good Looks Like

The 22 dedicated-form organizations demonstrate a clear contrast. Huntington Hospital (Northwell Health) maintains a separate "Request for Access to Health Information" form citing HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524, with "To me" as the first recipient option, 28 fillable fields, and seven delivery methods including secure email and USB drive. Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital separates patient requests from third-party authorizations entirely. Providence Sacred Heart offers a fillable form titled "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set." West Tennessee Healthcare explicitly frames its form around the patient's right to access their own information.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Major health systems are far more likely to offer a dedicated form: **23% of major-system-affiliated orgs** (15/65) have one, versus just **6% of independent orgs** (5/89) and **6% of regional systems** (2/36). Community hospitals lead by facility type at 18% (14/80), while critical access hospitals almost never differentiate (1/29, 3%). For-profit organizations lag at 7% (3/41) compared to nonprofits at 13% (16/125). No clear regional pattern emerges — the problem is nationwide.

## The Systemic Issue

Three-quarters of studied organizations give patients a form designed for someone *else* to request *their* records. This reflects a fundamental confusion between HIPAA § 164.508 (authorization for third-party disclosure) and § 164.524 (individual right of access). The patient's right of access requires no authorization — the patient is not "authorizing" anything, they are *exercising a right*. Yet the dominant workflow forces them into an authorization paradigm, collecting irrelevant information (recipient addresses, SSNs), imposing unnecessary requirements (witness signatures), and obscuring the rights HIPAA guarantees. The problem is worst at smaller, independent organizations that lack the compliance resources of major systems.
