# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 7 Findings

## Classification Summary

Across 190 organizations with synthesis data, the vast majority funnel patients through a generic third-party authorization form when the patient wants to request their own records. Only a fraction offer a dedicated pathway aligned with HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

| Pathway Type | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 156 | 82% |
| Dedicated patient access form | 7 | 4% |
| Both (dedicated + generic available) | 26 | 14% |
| No online pathway | 1 | <1% |

Of the 156 generic-only orgs, **none** meaningfully differentiate between a patient exercising their right of access and a third party requesting records. The 33 orgs that do differentiate (dedicated or both categories) represent just 17% of the total.

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

A patient requesting their own records through a generic authorization encounters several concrete problems:

**Wrong framing.** The form asks who records should be "released to" — forcing the patient to write their own name as the recipient. At Alabama Medical Group, the form's "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" structure is designed for inter-provider transfers. At Lexington Medical Center, patients must designate themselves as both "authorizer" and "recipient" in fields designed for third parties. The entire interaction is framed as *consent to disclose*, not as *exercising a right*.

**Unnecessary fields.** Generic forms routinely collect information irrelevant to self-access. Sixty-three orgs (33%) request Social Security Numbers — unnecessary for patient self-access and a meaningful identity theft risk. At Addabbo Family Health Center, the NY State OCA Form 960 collects SSN on a form originally designed for litigation. Many forms require a "purpose" selection among options like "Legal," "Insurance," and "Evaluation & Treatment," forcing the patient to choose "Other" or "Personal Use" from a list not designed for them.

**Legalistic language.** Generic forms use distancing third-person phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" (Guthrie Corning Hospital) rather than patient-centered language. Addabbo's OCA Form 960 opens with six numbered legal disclosures about HIV redisclosure warnings before any patient-fillable fields — language written for attorneys, with instructions explicitly referencing "litigation in New York State courts."

**Missing rights information.** Only 52% of orgs include any patient rights information on their forms. Generic forms virtually never reference the patient's right of access, HIPAA's 30-day response requirement, fee limits, or format options. At Mosaic Life Care, the form doesn't mention the patient portal, the right of access, response timelines, or fee limits. These rights exist regardless of form type, but the authorization workflow hides them.

**No delivery options.** Dedicated patient access forms typically offer multiple delivery methods. Intermountain Medical Center's patient form offers email, USB, CD, portal, and mail. By contrast, generic forms like Abbeville Area Medical Center's collect a recipient address and stop there — no electronic delivery, no format choice.

## What Good Looks Like

The 33 orgs with dedicated forms demonstrate a sharp contrast. **Huntington Hospital** (Northwell Health) maintains a separate "Request for Access to Health Information" form citing HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524, with "To me" as the first recipient option and 28 fillable fields. **Intermountain Medical Center** offers a single-page patient form with question-based headings ("What records do you want?"), 48 fillable fields, and email submission. **Flowers Hospital** titles its form "Patient Request for Health Information," lists "Myself" first among recipients, provides 66 fillable fields, a co-equal Spanish translation, and a Swellbox online portal.

These forms share key features: patient-access-specific titles, self-access as the default rather than an afterthought, explicit delivery format options, and language framed as exercising a right rather than granting permission.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Major health systems are far more likely to differentiate: **35% of major-system-affiliated orgs** offer a dedicated pathway, versus **12% of independent** and **6% of regional-system** orgs. Teaching hospitals lead by facility type (30%), followed by community hospitals (24%). Critical access hospitals (7%) and FQHCs (8%) almost never differentiate — likely reflecting limited compliance resources.

## The Systemic Issue

Eighty-two percent of organizations studied give patients a form designed for someone *else* to request *their* records. This reflects a fundamental conflation of HIPAA § 164.508 (authorization for third-party disclosure) with § 164.524 (individual right of access). A patient exercising their right of access requires no authorization — they are not "authorizing" anything. Yet the dominant workflow forces them into an authorization paradigm, collecting irrelevant data (SSNs, recipient addresses, purpose justifications), hiding their rights (response timelines, fee limits, format options), and framing a legal entitlement as a discretionary favor.
