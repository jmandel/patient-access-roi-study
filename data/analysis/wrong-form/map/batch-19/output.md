# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 19 Findings

## Summary

Across 190 organizations with scored data, **75% (142 orgs) use a generic HIPAA authorization form** — designed for third-party disclosure — as the primary mechanism for patients requesting their own records. Only **12% (22 orgs) provide a dedicated patient access form** aligned with HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524. The remaining organizations route patients through online portals (19 orgs, 10%), or offer phone/in-person pathways only (7 orgs, 4%).

## Classification Breakdown

| Pathway Type | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 132 | 69% |
| Generic with some self-access differentiation | 3 | 2% |
| Generic + dedicated form (BOTH) | 7 | 4% |
| Dedicated patient access form | 22 | 12% |
| Online portal with individual access | 10 | 5% |
| Online portal (generic) | 9 | 5% |
| Phone/in-person only | 7 | 4% |

Only 39 of 190 orgs (21%) offer any individual access pathway. A full 154 orgs (81%) do not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting them.

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

Patients encountering a generic authorization workflow face concrete problems:

**Self-referencing absurdity.** At Texas Oncology, a patient must fill both "I authorize the following to disclose" (naming Texas Oncology) and "Who can receive and use the health information?" (naming themselves) — an awkward exercise when requester and recipient are the same person. At Alabama Medical Group, the form has "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" fields designed for inter-provider transfers; a patient must write their own name in the "Release To" field.

**Wrong legal framing.** Generic forms invoke the authorization framework of § 164.508 rather than the right of access under § 164.524. Addabbo Family Health Center uses New York's OCA Form 960, whose instructions explicitly state it was "designed for release of health information needed for litigation." A patient exercising a federal right is filling out a litigation form. Piedmont Medical Center's form opens with "I authorize Piedmont Medical Center to disclose the following information..." — framing patient self-access as a consent-to-disclose rather than an exercise of legal rights.

**Unnecessary data collection.** At least 39 generic-form organizations request Social Security Numbers (full or partial) — information unnecessary for patient self-access and a serious identity theft risk on forms designed to be faxed or mailed. Examples include University of Mississippi Medical Center (full SSN), Lexington Medical Center (full SSN on a mailed form), and Grady Memorial Hospital (last four digits plus government-issued photo ID).

**Missing rights information.** Generic forms virtually never reference the patient's right of access, HIPAA's 30-day response requirement, fee limits, or format options. Patients don't learn about these protections through the authorization workflow.

**Irrelevant purpose fields.** At Texas Oncology, a patient must select "Personal Use" from nine disclosure reasons including "Legal Purposes," "Disability Determination," and "Employment." At Desert Regional Medical Center, "Continuation of Care" appears as the default first option, underscoring the form's third-party orientation.

## What Good Looks Like

The 22 dedicated-form organizations demonstrate the contrast. **Huntington Hospital** (Northwell Health) maintains a separate "Request for Access to Health Information" form that opens with an explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation, presents "To me" as the first recipient option, and offers seven delivery methods including secure email and USB drive. **Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital** separates its "Patient Request for Health Information" form from its third-party authorization, with "Myself" as the first checkbox and a portal callout at the top. These organizations average a patient-centeredness score of 4.5/5, compared to 2.7/5 for generic-only orgs.

## Patterns by Organization Type

The strongest predictor is system affiliation: **40% of major-system orgs** offer an individual access pathway versus just **12% of independent orgs** and **5% of regional systems**. By facility type, teaching hospitals lead (33%) and critical access hospitals trail dramatically (3% — just 1 of 29). FQHCs also lag at 8%. No strong regional pattern emerges — the problem is nationwide, ranging from 16% (Midwest) to 24% (South) with individual access.

## The Systemic Issue

The wrong-form problem is not a marginal edge case — it is the dominant pattern. Nearly four in five organizations hand patients a form designed for someone else to request their records, forcing patients to navigate irrelevant fields, confusing framing, and unnecessary data collection. The gap between generic and dedicated forms is not subtle: it is the difference between exercising a legal right and filling out a litigation authorization.
