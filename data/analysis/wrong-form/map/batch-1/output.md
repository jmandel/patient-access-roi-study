# The Wrong Form Problem — Batch 1 Analysis

## Classification Summary

Of the **71 organizations** in this batch:

| Pathway | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| **Generic HIPAA authorization only** | 55 | 77% |
| **Both dedicated + third-party forms** | 11 | 15% |
| **Dedicated patient form only** | 1 | 1% |
| **Portal-only (no downloadable form)** | 3 | 4% |
| **Could not determine** | 1 | 1% |

Over three-quarters of organizations funnel patients requesting their own records through a generic third-party authorization form — a document designed for releasing records to attorneys, insurers, and other providers.

## Organizations With Dedicated Patient Access Forms

Eleven organizations offer separate forms for patient self-access and third-party release — a genuine best practice. These include **Phelps Hospital** and **Huntington Hospital** (both Northwell Health, citing § 164.524 in a dedicated "Request for Access" form), **Intermountain Medical Center** (separate "Patient Request for Health Information" with question-based headings like "How do you want your records delivered?"), **UAB Hospital** (dedicated form with a rights-affirming opening statement and tiered record packages), **Barnes-Jewish Hospital** (a concise one-page access form using right-of-access framing), **Aurora Medical Center–Grafton** (Advocate Health's "Patient Request for Health Information" with a prominent patient portal callout), **UTMB Health** (Form 7033 for patients, Form 7032 for third parties), **St. Joseph's Hospital** (Dignity Health), **Baton Rouge Clinic** (a dedicated "Right of Access" form citing § 164.524), **MUSC Health** (process-level differentiation via MyChart/Swellbox for self-access), and **NewYork-Presbyterian** (Verisma portal with a dedicated patient link). **Wayne County Hospital** stands alone as the only organization offering a dedicated patient form without a separate third-party release form. Three organizations (**Minnie Hamilton**, **The Iowa Clinic**, **HopeHealth**) are portal-only, routing all requests through third-party platforms (ChartRequest, Swellbox, HealthMark) with no downloadable form.

## What Makes a Generic Form a Poor Fit

The mismatch between generic authorization forms and patient self-access is structural, not cosmetic. A patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) is not "authorizing" anyone to do anything — they are requesting access to their own information. Yet the generic form forces them into the wrong legal and conceptual framework:

**Wrong framing.** Forms titled "Authorization for Release/Disclosure of PHI" treat the patient as granting permission rather than exercising a right. At **Cordova Community Medical Center**, a patient must write their own name in the "Release To" field of a form designed for inter-facility transfers. At **GI Alliance**, the patient encounters a form titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" with no acknowledgment that patient access is a legally distinct process.

**Irrelevant fields and confusion.** Generic forms require patients to navigate sections that don't apply to self-access: recipient relationship fields, redisclosure restrictions, expiration dates, and revocation clauses. At **A.O. Fox Hospital** (Bassett), patients must work through verbal communication authorization and expiration sections designed for third-party releases. At **St. Charles Redmond**, dual "From/To" sections have identical instruction text, creating confusion about which section applies.

**Wrong legal framework.** Using a § 164.508 authorization form for a § 164.524 access request has material consequences. Authorization-based forms may impose higher fees (not limited to HIPAA's cost-based cap), broader denial grounds, and unnecessary requirements like expiration dates. At **Myrtue Medical Center**, the form applies authorization-specific requirements (expiration, revocation) to what should be a simpler access request. At **UPMC Presbyterian**, fee language cites Pennsylvania state law without distinguishing patient access fees from third-party fees.

**Purpose fields that HIPAA doesn't require.** Many generic forms demand patients state a reason for their request — "Personal Use," "Patient Request," or similar — even though HIPAA explicitly does not require patients to justify access to their own records. At **Broward Health**, the purpose field is required with no patient access exception.

## The Patient Experience

A patient at one of the 55 generic-only organizations faces a process that was not designed for them. They download a form meant for attorneys and insurers, puzzle over where to put their own name, skip sections about redisclosure and recipient relationships, select "Personal Use" from a list of purposes that includes "Legal," "Insurance," and "Workers' Compensation," and sign an authorization granting permission for something they already have a right to. At organizations like **Columbus Community Hospital** (2014 form), **Natividad Medical Center** (image-only scan), or **Black River Memorial Hospital** (text rendered as 970 embedded images), this is compounded by non-fillable PDFs requiring a print-and-handwrite workflow.

The contrast with best-practice organizations is stark. Northwell Health's dedicated access form opens with "Under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524), you have a right to access your health information" and offers a simple "To me" checkbox. Intermountain's patient form asks "What records do you want?" and "How do you want your records delivered?" — conversational questions rather than legal declarations. These forms take 30 seconds to understand; the generic alternative takes several minutes of careful reading to determine what applies.

## Conclusion

The dominant pattern in this batch is clear: **77% of organizations provide only a generic third-party authorization form for patients seeking their own records.** This is not a minor usability issue — it applies the wrong legal framework, creates unnecessary confusion, and fails to inform patients of their affirmative right of access. The 15% that maintain separate forms demonstrate that differentiation is feasible at every scale, from Wayne County Hospital (a 25-bed rural facility) to Northwell Health (a major metro system). The wrong-form problem is a choice, not an inevitability.
