# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 1 Analysis

## Summary

The dominant pattern across this 195-organization batch is stark: **75% of organizations (142/190 with data) offer patients only a generic third-party HIPAA authorization form** when those patients are trying to exercise their individual Right of Access under § 164.524. Only 22 organizations (12%) provide a dedicated patient access form, and 19 of those also maintain a separate generic form for third-party releases. Another 19 orgs (10%) route patients to an online portal, while 7 (4%) offer only phone or in-person pathways. Five organizations had insufficient data for classification.

## Classification Tally

| Pathway | Count | % of classified |
|---------|------:|------:|
| Generic authorization only (no self-access differentiation) | 133 | 70% |
| Generic authorization (with some self-access signal) | 9 | 5% |
| Dedicated patient access form (with separate generic form — "BOTH") | 19 | 10% |
| Dedicated patient access form only | 3 | 2% |
| Online portal | 19 | 10% |
| Phone/in-person only | 7 | 4% |
| Cannot determine | 5 | — |

## What Makes Generic Forms a Poor Fit

When a patient wants *their own* records, a generic authorization form creates several concrete problems:

**Wrong framing.** These forms are titled "Authorization for Release/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — language that frames the transaction as releasing records *to someone else*. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name as both the authorizer and the recipient. At Lane County Hospital, patients must "awkwardly list themselves as both the authorizing party and the recipient, navigating a form that was not designed with their use case in mind." At Riverside Community Hospital, patients "must awkwardly enter their own name and address as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case." At Bath Community Hospital, the "Send/Receive" and "To/From" structure is "designed primarily for inter-provider record transfers, not for patient self-access."

**Unnecessary fields and barriers.** Generic forms often include fields irrelevant to self-access: third-party recipient addresses, purpose-of-disclosure checkboxes designed for insurance or legal requests, and expiration dates (which apply to authorizations but not to access requests). Among the 142 generic-only organizations, 19 (13%) require a witness or notarized signature — a requirement HIPAA does not impose for patient access requests. Duly Health and Care's form demands a witness for "Personal Reasons" requests and categorically rejects requests for "all records," potentially violating the Right of Access.

**No rights information.** Generic forms almost never mention § 164.524, the 30-day response deadline, HIPAA fee limits for patient access, or the patient's right to receive records in their requested format. At Grady Memorial Hospital, "there is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access." The form treats patient self-access as just another disclosure purpose, burying "Personal" among options like "Insurance," "Legal," and "Continuing Care."

**Technical barriers compound the problem.** Of the 142 generic-only organizations, 106 (75%) offer non-fillable PDFs — scanned images or flat documents requiring print-and-handwrite completion. Combined with the conceptual mismatch, a patient must decode an unfamiliar form structure, handwrite entries in underscore blanks, and figure out fax submission — all without guidance tailored to their situation.

## The Contrast: What Good Looks Like

The 22 organizations with dedicated patient access forms demonstrate what's possible. Northwell Health (serving Huntington and Phelps Hospitals) maintains a separate "Request for Access to Health Information" form that opens with an explicit § 164.524 citation, presents "To me" as the first recipient option, and offers 28 fillable fields. Intermountain, Providence, and Advocate/Aurora systems similarly distinguish patient access from third-party release. These organizations score markedly higher on patient-centeredness: **4.4/5 average** versus **2.9/5** for generic-only organizations.

Nine organizations occupy a middle ground — using a generic authorization form but incorporating some self-access differentiation. UCHealth includes an explicit "If released to self" section with dedicated delivery options. Michigan Medicine's form has a "Myself" section for self-requests with free delivery. Ben Taub's dual-purpose form conditionally marks sections as "not required" for patient self-access. These adaptations reduce but don't eliminate the mismatch.

## Systemic Pattern

The wrong-form problem cuts across every facility type: 53 of 80 community hospitals (66%), 24 of 30 teaching hospitals (80%), 27 of 29 critical access hospitals (93%), and 17 of 25 FQHCs (68%) rely on generic-only forms. Critical access hospitals and teaching hospitals are the most likely to funnel patients through third-party authorization workflows. Organizations within large systems (HCA, SSM Health, Mercy Health, Bon Secours) tend to use standardized corporate templates that were designed as general-purpose authorization forms and deployed without adaptation for patient self-access.

The core issue is conceptual, not technical: most healthcare organizations have not internalized that a patient requesting their own records is exercising a *right*, not requesting a *favor* that requires authorization. Until organizations build distinct pathways for these fundamentally different transactions, patients will continue navigating forms designed for someone else's use case.
