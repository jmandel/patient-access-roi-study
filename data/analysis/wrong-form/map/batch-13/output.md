# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 13 Findings

## Classification Summary

Across 190 organizations with scored synthesis data, the overwhelming majority funnel patients through a form designed for third-party disclosure rather than individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

| Pathway Type | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| **Generic HIPAA authorization only** | 135 | 71% |
| **Both** (dedicated patient form + generic authorization) | 28 | 15% |
| **Online portal** (third-party vendor) | 19 | 10% |
| **No online pathway** (phone/in-person only) | 7 | 4% |
| **Dedicated patient access form only** | 1 | <1% |

Just 29 organizations (15%) offer any form explicitly designed for patient self-access. The remaining 135 generic-only orgs — 71% of those studied — treat a patient requesting their own records identically to a lawyer, insurer, or ex-spouse requesting them.

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

A patient using a generic HIPAA authorization for self-access encounters several concrete problems:

**Wrong framing.** The form asks "who should we release your records *to*?" — forcing the patient to write their own name as the recipient. At **Abbeville Area Medical Center**, the patient must list themselves under "Name/Facility" in a field designed for external organizations. At **Alabama Medical Group**, patients place their own name in the "Release To" field. The entire document frames records access as *authorizing disclosure to a third party*, not exercising a personal right.

**Unnecessary fields.** Generic forms require a recipient name, address, and relationship — meaningless for self-access. **Addabbo Family Health Center** uses New York's OCA Form 960, originally designed for litigation, which collects Social Security Numbers. Across all generic-only orgs, 38 red flags cite SSN collection, creating privacy risk on forms that may be faxed or emailed. At **Lincoln Hospital** in Davenport, WA, page 1 is entirely third-party-oriented while page 2 acknowledges patient access rights — but offers no guidance on how to reconcile the two.

**Expiration clauses.** Generic authorizations carry expiration dates (often 60–90 days) because third-party authorizations should be time-limited. But a patient access request is a one-time event — an expiration date is meaningless and confusing. At **Advocare**, a 90-day default expiration risks requiring patients to re-authorize if processing takes too long.

**Missing rights information.** Generic forms virtually never reference the patient's right of access, HIPAA's 30-day response requirement, fee limits, or format options (electronic, paper, CD). These rights exist regardless of form type, but patients never learn about them through the authorization workflow.

**Witness requirements.** 27 generic-only orgs impose witness or notary requirements that exceed HIPAA's requirements for patient access. At **Abbeville Area Medical Center**, two witness signatures are required — an unnecessary burden that could delay or prevent a patient from completing the form at home.

## The Patient-Centeredness Gap

The data quantifies the impact: generic-only orgs average a patient-centeredness score of **2.85/5**, compared to **4.21/5** for orgs offering both dedicated and generic forms. This 1.4-point gap — nearly a full grade level — reflects the structural mismatch between form design and patient need.

## Positive Contrasts

**Valleywise Health Medical Center** (Phoenix, AZ) exemplifies best practice. It maintains two distinct forms: Form 45643 ("Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information") for self-access and Form 43439 for third-party authorization. The patient form omits recipient designation, purpose fields, and expiration clauses — all appropriate for a one-time access request. It offers bilingual English/Spanish content and granular record-type selection.

**Wayne County Hospital** (Monticello, KY) — the sole "dedicated-only" org — provides a form titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" that centers the patient as the expected user, with "self" listed first among options. It also offers a parallel web-based form for electronic submission — progressive for a 25-bed rural CAH.

## Pattern

The wrong-form problem is pervasive and systemic. Seven in ten organizations give patients a form that treats them as outsiders requesting someone else's information. The form's framing, fields, and legal infrastructure all assume third-party disclosure. This is not a minor labeling issue — it creates confusion, collects unnecessary sensitive data, imposes inapplicable requirements, and obscures patient rights that HIPAA guarantees.
