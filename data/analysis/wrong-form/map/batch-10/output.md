# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 10 Analysis

## Classification Summary

Across 190 organizations with synthesis data, the pathway breakdown is stark:

| Pathway Type | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 142 | 75% |
| Dedicated patient access form (or both) | 22 | 12% |
| Online portal (third-party vendor) | 19 | 10% |
| Phone/in-person only (no online pathway) | 7 | 4% |

Of the 22 orgs with dedicated forms, 21 maintain *both* a patient access form and a separate generic authorization — only Wayne County Hospital offers a dedicated form alone. Among the 142 generic-only orgs, just 9 (6%) make any attempt to differentiate self-access from third-party release, such as including a "myself" checkbox. The remaining **133 orgs (70% of the full sample) treat a patient requesting their own records identically to an insurance company or attorney requesting them.**

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

Patients navigating the generic authorization workflow encounter several concrete problems:

**Wrong framing.** The form asks who records should be "released to," forcing patients to write their own name as the recipient. At Abbeville Area Medical Center, patients must list themselves under "Name/Facility" — a field designed for external organizations. Columbus Community Hospital's form is "structured exclusively for third-party release with no patient self-access pathway or guidance." The entire document frames records access as *authorizing disclosure to someone else*, not exercising a personal right.

**Unnecessary and risky fields.** Thirty-nine generic-only orgs (27%) collect Social Security Numbers — entirely unnecessary for patient self-access and a significant identity-theft risk on forms routinely faxed. Twenty-eight orgs (20%) require witness signatures, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access. Abbeville requires *two* witness signatures. These fields add friction to what should be a straightforward request.

**Missing rights information.** Generic forms virtually never reference the patient's right of access, HIPAA's 30-day response deadline, cost-based fee limits, or electronic format options. The Abbeville HIPAA brochure articulates these rights clearly — but it is a separate document, entirely disconnected from the authorization workflow. Patients must synthesize information across documents themselves.

**No delivery options.** Dedicated patient access forms typically offer multiple delivery methods. Huntington Hospital (Northwell) offers seven: mail, pickup, secure email, unsecure email with risk acknowledgment, fax, USB, and CD. Generic forms rarely go beyond collecting a mailing address. Sixteen generic-only orgs require physical delivery with no electronic alternative.

**Legalistic language.** Generic forms use distancing phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" rather than patient-centered language. Addabbo Family Health Center uses New York's OCA Form 960 — a form originally designed for litigation. Consensus Health's only ROI form is an unbranded template hosted on a third-party CDN, with zero fillable fields and no submission instructions.

## What Good Looks Like

The contrast with dedicated forms is sharp. **Huntington Hospital** (Northwell Health) maintains a separate "Request for Access to Health Information" form citing HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524, with "To me" as the first recipient option, 28 fillable fields, and companion instructions with annotated visual examples. **Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital** provides a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" form with a "Myself" checkbox and portal callout. **Intermountain Medical Center** offers a fillable PDF specifically titled for patient requests.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Major health systems are far more likely to provide a dedicated form: **23% of major-system-affiliated orgs** have one, compared to just **6% of independents and regional systems**. This likely reflects the compliance resources and centralized form governance available to large systems — 15 of the 22 dedicated-form orgs are major-system-affiliated. By facility type, community hospitals lead (14 of 22), while critical access hospitals almost universally default to generic forms (only 1 of 29 differentiates). For-profit orgs trail (7% dedicated) compared to nonprofits (13%).

## The Core Issue

Three-quarters of organizations give patients a form designed for someone *else* to request *their* records. This reflects a fundamental conflation of HIPAA § 164.508 (authorization for third-party disclosure) and § 164.524 (individual right of access). A patient exercising their right of access is not "authorizing" anything — they are exercising a statutory right. Yet the dominant workflow forces them into an authorization paradigm: naming themselves as the recipient of their own records, navigating fields meant for attorneys and insurers, and encountering no information about the rights HIPAA guarantees them. The problem is nationwide, cuts across facility types, and is only systematically addressed by the largest health systems.
