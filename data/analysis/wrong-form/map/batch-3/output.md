# Batch 3: The Wrong Form Problem — Access Pathway Classification

## Tally (70 organizations)

| Classification | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| **GENERIC only** | 54 | 77% |
| **BOTH** (dedicated + generic) | 7 | 10% |
| **DEDICATED** patient access form | 1 | 1% |
| **GENERIC + portal accommodation** | 8 | 11% |

Only **8 of 70 organizations (11%)** offer a dedicated patient access form — either standalone or alongside a generic authorization. The remaining **62 (89%)** funnel patients through a third-party release authorization, sometimes softened by a portal pathway or conditional form sections, but never through a form designed around individual access rights.

## Organizations With Dedicated Patient Access Forms

Seven organizations maintain **separate forms** for patient self-access and third-party release (BOTH): **Phelps Hospital** (Northwell Health), **Providence Sacred Heart**, **Providence St. Vincent**, **Valleywise Health**, **Barnes-Jewish Hospital**, **Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers**, and **AdventHealth Central Texas**. One organization — **Flowers Hospital** — offers a single form explicitly designed around patient self-access ("Patient Request for Health Information" with "Myself" as the first recipient option), earning DEDICATED classification.

These forms share recognizable design choices: titles framed as "Request for Access" rather than "Authorization for Release," no requirement to name a third-party recipient, explicit citation of HIPAA § 164.524, and delivery format options (MyChart, email, CD) presented as first-class features. Barnes-Jewish's form is one page with 12 fields; Providence Sacred Heart's has 45 fillable fields across 2 pages. Both prove that a dedicated form can be simpler *and* more functional than the generic alternative.

## The Generic Form Experience: What Patients Actually Encounter

When a patient at one of the 54 generic-only organizations wants their own records, the form treats them as a third party requesting someone else's information. The mismatch manifests in several concrete ways:

**Self-referential absurdity.** Lane County Hospital's form asks patients to "authorize [the hospital] to disclose... to [name]" — requiring the patient to list themselves as both authorizer and recipient. Millinocket Regional Hospital's form has "Name of Institution or Person" fields designed for inter-facility transfers. A patient must write their own home address in a field designed for a doctor's office.

**Irrelevant fields and legal language.** At Good Samaritan Medical Center, patients encounter raw mail-merge placeholders (`«PatientNumber»`, `«PatientName»`) and a broken internal reference to a Privacy Office address "listed below" that doesn't exist. Troy Regional Medical Center's form includes a broad liability waiver ("discharge the facility from any and all liabilities") — language designed for releasing records to third parties, not for exercising a fundamental right. Hillcrest Hospital Claremore bundles a blanket liability release into the authorization itself.

**Purpose fields that shouldn't exist.** HIPAA does not require patients to state *why* they want their own records. Yet Carle BroMenn, DHR Health, Adena Regional, and dozens of others require a "purpose of disclosure" — with options like "Insurance," "Legal," "Continuing Care," and "Personal" listed as coequals. At Community Health Center of Central Missouri, the FROM/TO structure is so provider-transfer-oriented that patients can't easily determine which fields apply to them.

**Wrong fee frameworks.** SSM Health St. Mary's Madison mentions charges for "viewing" records — HIPAA prohibits charging patients to inspect their own records. Lincoln Hospital cites a WAC per-page fee schedule ($26 base + $1.17/page) that likely exceeds HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access. These fee structures exist because the form was designed for third-party release, where different (higher) fee rules apply.

## Portal Accommodations

Eight organizations offer generic PDF forms but partially compensate through portal pathways or conditional form design. **Ben Taub Hospital** (Harris Health) uses conditional sections marking fields as "not required" for patient self-access — a thoughtful accommodation within a generic form. **UCHealth** includes an explicit "If released to self" section with four delivery options and free pricing. **Labette Health** and **The Valley Hospital** direct patients to online portals (Formstack and identity-verified wizard, respectively) as the primary pathway, with generic PDFs as fallbacks. **Bayshore Medical Center**, **Bon Secours St. Mary's**, **Piedmont Medical Center**, and **Springhill Medical Center** offer Swellbox/Datavant portals alongside generic PDFs.

These portals mitigate the wrong-form problem at the process level, but patients who download the PDF — still linked prominently on most medical records pages — encounter the same generic authorization mismatch.

## The Systemic Pattern

The wrong-form problem is not about bad actors. It reflects an industry default: organizations purchase or template a single all-purpose ROI authorization form and use it for every disclosure scenario. The eight organizations with dedicated forms demonstrate that the solution is straightforward — a one-page form titled "Request for Access," citing § 164.524, with no recipient field, no purpose requirement, and delivery format checkboxes. Philadelphia FIGHT, a small FQHC, manages this. Barnes-Jewish, a major teaching hospital, manages this. The 89% that don't are not facing a resource constraint — they simply haven't recognized patient self-access as a distinct use case worth designing for.
