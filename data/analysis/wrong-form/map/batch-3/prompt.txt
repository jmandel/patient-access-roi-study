You are investigating a specific problem in healthcare record access: organizations
that offer patients a generic third-party authorization form when the patient actually wants
to request their OWN records under HIPAA's Right of Access.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata.

Your task: for each org in this batch, classify its access pathway:
- Does it offer a DEDICATED patient access form (designed for individual access under § 164.524)?
- Does it only offer a GENERIC HIPAA authorization form (designed for third-party release)?
- Does it offer BOTH (separate forms for each purpose)?
- Is it PORTAL-ONLY (no downloadable form)?
- Could you NOT DETERMINE from the available materials?

For orgs using only a generic form: what specifically makes it a poor fit for patient
self-access? What would a patient experience — confusion, extra fields, wrong framing?

Tally counts. Cite specific examples of the mismatch problem.

# Lane County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lane County Hospital is a government-owned, independent critical access hospital in Dighton, Kansas. The facility offers a single pathway for medical records requests: a one-page PDF authorization form available on its website. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient self-access form.

## Available Pathways and Form Classification

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "Authorization for Release of Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for third-party release of information. It uses the standard disclosure structure — "I authorize [entity] to disclose... to [name]" — which frames the transaction as releasing records to someone other than the patient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the authorizing party and the recipient, navigating a form that was not designed with their use case in mind.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access requests and third-party authorization releases. There is no separate patient access request form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 individual access rights, and no streamlined process for patients who simply want to review or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was exceptionally easy. A basic web search immediately identified the hospital's Records Request page, which contains a single "Click Here" link to the PDF. No login, bot blocking, or portal navigation was required. For a small rural hospital, this level of web accessibility is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally created PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore lines, requiring the patient to print the form and complete it by hand (or use third-party PDF annotation tools). The form is one page long with a logical flow: patient identification at top, authorization body, 16 record-type checkboxes, legal disclosures, and signature block. The record-type checkboxes offer strong granularity — 16 categories from Anesthesia Records to Social Work Reports — giving patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.

The language is a mix of plain language and standard legal boilerplate. Some sentences are convoluted ("I understand that I may refuse to sign this Authorization and that my treatment of payment for my treatment will not be affected...") but the form is generally readable. The title contains a typo ("HEATH" instead of "HEALTH") that has persisted since at least 2018. "Psychotherapy Notes" appears twice in the checkbox list, and a cryptic "RESOURCE: MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FORM" reference at the bottom could confuse patients.

## Submission and Barriers

The form directs patients to return it via **fax** to one of two numbers. No email, mail, or online submission option is mentioned. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway.

Two unnecessary barriers stand out. First, the form requests a **Social Security Number**, which is not required for HIPAA-compliant release processing and creates identity theft risk on a form routinely transmitted by fax. Second, a **witness signature line** creates an implicit expectation that a witness is needed, though HIPAA does not require one for valid authorization. Together these add friction and potential deterrence for patients acting alone.

No fees are mentioned. The form includes solid compliance elements: an expiration field, a citation of Kansas SB 119's one-year authorization limit, and clear revocation instructions naming the Privacy Officer with full contact information.

## Overall Assessment

Lane County Hospital makes its records request form easy to find and keeps it concise at one page with good record-type granularity. However, the form funnels all requesters — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization designed for disclosure to others, not for individual access. The lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, and the witness signature line create unnecessary friction. For a small critical access hospital, the web accessibility is commendable, but the form itself reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-centered approach to individual access rights.

# Sea Mar Community Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Sea Mar Community Health Centers is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Seattle, WA. The organization publishes a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — that serves as the only downloadable pathway for patients requesting their own records. Sea Mar also offers a patient portal (MyChart) at seamar.org/ohr/index.php, though this was not evaluated as part of the form retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Sea Mar does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios — transfer of care, third-party release, and patient-initiated requests alike. The "Purpose of the release" section includes "At my request" as one option alongside "Transfer of Care" and "Verbal Disclosure," but there is no separate patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no mention of the specific protections that apply to individual access requests (fee limits, format choice, 30-day timeline). A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form that treats their legally-distinct right as just another checkbox on a general authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned a direct link to the PDF on the first attempt, and a site-scoped search confirmed no other ROI forms exist. There was no bot blocking, login wall, or CAPTCHA. The URL (`seamar.org/dl/ROI%20COPY%202022%20PDF.pdf`) uses the acronym "ROI" which patients are unlikely to recognize, but the form was immediately discoverable through search engines. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations make their forms far harder to find.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page PDF with a text layer (not a scanned image), but it has **zero fillable fields**. All entries use underscores and blank lines designed for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and return it — there are no interactive checkboxes, text inputs, or digital signature fields. The form cannot be completed digitally without third-party PDF annotation tools.

The layout is structured with labeled sections on the left side (Patient Information, From, To, Information to be released, etc.) following a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the single-page compression creates density issues with minimal whitespace. The language mixes plain directions with legal terminology — the reference to "Title 42 of the United States code" is imprecise (it should cite 42 CFR Part 2 specifically) and provides no actionable information to patients.

The instruction "Please initial one section" under record types is confusing — there are actually six initialing options, some of which patients might logically want to combine. The "All records" option excludes sensitive information without clearly cross-referencing the separate sensitive information section below, creating a two-step requirement that patients could easily miss.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is the **apparent requirement for in-person submission**. The form lists delivery methods for receiving records (In-Clinic, Verbal, CD, Paper, Fax) but provides no mailing address, fax number, or email address for submitting the completed form. The "Staff Use Only" section — with checkboxes for "Verified all sections are complete" and staff initials — strongly implies the form is designed to be completed in-clinic, in front of staff. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeline is stated. The 90-day default expiration is reasonable for a third-party authorization but conceptually irrelevant for a patient access request, since the right of access is ongoing.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular record type options**: The "Recent summary of care" itemizes specific components (Medication List, Problem List, Progress Notes, Imaging, Immunizations, screening results), giving patients a clear picture of what they'll receive.
- **Minor consent section**: A well-structured section for minors ages 13–17 to authorize release of sensitive information, with age thresholds aligned to Washington State's mature minor doctrine.
- **Easy discoverability**: The form was found on the first search attempt with no access barriers.
- **Patient rights statement**: Present, though generic — covers revocation right and no-conditioning, but does not reference individual access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Sea Mar provides a functional but paper-centric, undifferentiated pathway for patient record access. The form is easy to find online but impossible to complete digitally, and the apparent in-person submission requirement creates a meaningful barrier. The conflation of patient self-access with third-party authorization means patients receive no information about their specific rights under HIPAA's Right of Access. For an FQHC serving diverse communities, the absence of a Spanish-language version and the lack of any digital workflow are notable gaps.

# Troy Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Troy Regional Medical Center is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Troy, Alabama. The organization presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in the study: the only ROI form available is a decade-old, image-only scanned PDF hosted on a defunct legacy website, with no corresponding page or link on the hospital's current site.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page "Release of Information/PHI" authorization (form-1.pdf), dated February 2015. It is a general-purpose third-party release authorization—not a patient-access-specific form—though it does include a "Self" checkbox among the recipient options (alongside Physician, Attorney, and Other). No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

The form offers three delivery methods via checkbox: mail, fax, and in-person pickup. However, the form itself contains **no submission instructions**—no mailing address, fax number, email address, or department name. A patient who downloads and completes this form would have no idea where to send it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Troy Regional Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization that treats a patient requesting their own records identically to an attorney or physician requesting records on someone's behalf. The form's legal language—including a broad liability waiver and re-disclosure warnings—is oriented toward third-party release scenarios and is conceptually mismatched when a patient checks "Self."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required exceptional effort. The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) has no medical records page, no HIM department listing, and no downloadable forms. The Patient Information page returned a 502 Bad Gateway error. The form was ultimately located only on the hospital's legacy FastHealth-hosted site (trmc.fasthealth.com), which is no longer linked from the current site. A real patient navigating the current website would almost certainly fail to find this form. Only archival web searching revealed it.

## Form Document Quality

The form is an image-only scan (grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI) with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers, cannot be searched or copied, and must be printed and filled entirely by hand. The scan quality introduces some blur, and the legal text is in small (approximately 9–10pt) type. It is served over unencrypted HTTP.

Despite the poor technical quality, the visual layout is reasonably organized. The title is clear, fields flow logically from demographics to record type selection to signatures, and the form fits on a single page. Record type granularity is adequate, with 10+ checkbox options plus an "Entire Record" option and date range fields.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Several significant barriers are present:

- **"All fields MUST be completed" warning**: The form states that any blank field renders the authorization invalid—an overreach beyond HIPAA's actual requirements that could deter patients who cannot provide every piece of information.
- **Broad liability waiver**: Patients must discharge the facility from "any and all liabilities" as a condition of signing—not a HIPAA requirement and inappropriate for patient self-access.
- **Witness signature required**: A witness signature line adds an unnecessary step with no legal basis under HIPAA for patient access requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no contact information for where to send the completed authorization.
- **Anti-conditioning language contradicts itself**: The form states treatment may not be conditioned on authorization, then immediately notes that "if conditioning is permitted, refusal to sign... may result in denial of care."

## Strengths

The only modest bright spot is the record type granularity—patients can select specific record types or request the entire record, with date range specification. The form also correctly references revocation rights.

## Overall Assessment

Troy Regional Medical Center's patient access experience is among the poorest possible. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, image-only scan quality, generic third-party framing, multiple compliance red flags, and a form that is over a decade old paints a picture of an organization that has not invested in patient access infrastructure. A patient attempting to request their own records online from this facility would face a near-impossible task.

# Abbeville Area Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Abbeville Area Medical Center (AAMC) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Abbeville, South Carolina. Two documents were found on its website: an authorization form for releasing protected health information (form-1.pdf) and a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices brochure (form-2.pdf). Only the authorization form is relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Patient Self-Access Distinction

AAMC provides a single, generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (HIM 1022) for all record requests. The form is clearly designed for third-party release — it asks the patient to identify a "Name/Facility" recipient and authorize disclosure "to the following individual or group." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the patient and the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no separate pathway or section for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524, and no mention of the right to access one's own records anywhere on the authorization form.

The companion HIPAA brochure (form-2.pdf) does articulate patient rights well, including the right to electronic copies and a 30-day response timeline, but this informational document is entirely disconnected from the authorization workflow. A patient would need to read two separate documents and synthesize the information themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via Patients & Visitors navigation. The PDF is directly linked and downloads without login, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking. The WordPress site is simple and functional. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form is a single page — admirably brief compared to multi-page forms at other organizations. It follows a logical numbered structure: authorization/recipient identification, record type selection (16 specific checkboxes), dates of service, purpose, and signature block. However, the form has significant technical limitations:

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields. All checkboxes are static Unicode characters, and all blanks are underscored lines. A patient must print the PDF and fill it in by hand.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no address, fax number, email, or department contact. A patient downloading this from the website would have no idea where to send the completed form. The fax number and mailing address must be found separately (the NPP brochure provides the Privacy Officer's P.O. Box and phone number).
- **No "All Records" option**: The 16 granular checkboxes are useful for targeted requests but there is no "Complete Medical Record" option for patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Ambiguous fields**: Item 2 ("Date records were printed and/or CD was requested") appears to be an internal staff field but is numbered as if patients should complete it.

The language is a mix of plain English at the top and denser legal boilerplate at the bottom. Required fields are marked with asterisks, but the legend ("* Must Have Information") appears only at the very bottom of the page.

## Barriers

- **Witness requirement**: The form requires two witness signatures (marked with asterisks as required), which goes beyond HIPAA requirements for patient self-access and creates a logistical barrier.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: The form automatically includes authorization to release psychiatric, substance abuse, HIV, and STD records with no opt-out mechanism. Patients who want general medical records but wish to exclude sensitive categories cannot do so.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signing, which could force resubmission if processing is delayed.
- **No fee information**: The form discloses nothing about costs. The NPP brochure vaguely mentions "there will be a charge" without amounts.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: Everything fits on one page, reducing patient burden.
- **Fax acceptance**: The form explicitly states "A faxed copy of this release shall be deemed as having the same effect as the original," enabling remote submission.
- **Granular record-type selection**: The 16 checkboxes give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **NPP quality**: The privacy brochure includes clear language about the right to electronic copies and a 30-day timeline — strong for a small critical access hospital.

## Overall Assessment

AAMC provides a minimally adequate but dated approach to patient record requests. The form is easy to find and mercifully short, but it offers no digital-first workflow, no patient-access-specific pathway, and no submission instructions. A patient must print the form, handwrite their information, find a fax number or mailing address from a separate document, and obtain two witness signatures — all to exercise a fundamental HIPAA right. The organization earns credit for accessibility of retrieval and brevity of form, but loses ground on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and unnecessary barriers. Grade: **C**.

# Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Chandler, AZ, with eight office locations across the Phoenix metro area. Three documents were retrieved: an incoming records request form (form-1), the primary outbound ROI authorization form (form-2), and a new patient forms packet from a sister site (form-3). Only form-2 serves a patient requesting their own records from Ironwood.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Ironwood does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-2, a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" designed to serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party release, legal, insurance, and disability. The form uses a "To" and "From" field structure oriented toward third-party transfers, which can confuse patients seeking their own records. However, "Personal Use" is explicitly listed as the first purpose option, which partially signals awareness of patient self-access as a legitimate use case.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or use individual-access-specific language. A patient must navigate a form designed around third-party release and determine which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the ROI form required **moderate-to-significant effort**. The patient forms page at ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/ existed but did not expose downloadable links — possibly due to JavaScript rendering requirements or link removal. The primary ROI form (form-2) was only discoverable via site-specific search engine queries. Its URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/`) suggests it dates from March 2019 and may be effectively orphaned. Ironically, the incoming records form (form-1) was updated more recently (November 2023) and is fillable, suggesting the organization invested in making it easy for other providers to send records to Ironwood while neglecting the patient-facing release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable/interactive fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a notable gap, especially given that form-1 (the incoming records form) has 22 fillable fields. The asymmetry suggests intentional or negligent underinvestment in the patient-facing document.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → record types → date range → purpose → delivery method → legal disclosures → signatures. Seven record type categories (physician's notes, lab reports, radiology reports, biopsy reports, prescriptions, radiology imaging, plus "Other") provide reasonable granularity for a cancer center. Five delivery methods are offered: fax, secure email, mail, pick up, and patient portal — a strong set of options including two electronic channels beyond fax.

The form lacks any introductory instructions or plain-language guidance. Legal disclosures are presented in dense paragraph format on page 2, though "I UNDERSTAND THAT" headers provide some scannability. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions available.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fee disclosure is vague: "A fee may be charged for providing the protected health information" — no amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees. This ambiguity could discourage patients.

No notarization or witness signature is required. The non-conditioning statement is present and appropriate. Revocation rights are clearly stated. The authorization expires after one year, which is standard.

A notable red flag on form-1 (though not the primary patient form): the STD definition section cites Washington state law (RCW 70.24) despite Ironwood being an Arizona practice — a template-copy error that raises questions about form review diligence.

## Strengths

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: Offering secure email and patient portal alongside fax, mail, and pickup gives patients meaningful choice — better than many comparable practices.
- **"Personal Use" as an explicit purpose**: Listing this as the first purpose option is a small but meaningful signal of patient access awareness.
- **Reasonable record type granularity**: The checkbox categories are well-suited to oncology records.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable patient form vs. fillable provider form**: The clearest indicator of misaligned priorities.
- **Orphaned form**: Not linked from any active webpage; discoverable only via search engines.
- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Generic authorization for all release types.
- **Vague fee language**: Could deter patients from exercising their access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers provides a **minimally adequate** but clearly deprioritized pathway for patient self-access to records. The generic authorization form technically works for patient self-access, and the inclusion of electronic delivery options (secure email, patient portal) is a genuine strength. However, the non-fillable form, orphaned web presence, vague fee language, and lack of any patient-access-specific design collectively signal that individual record access is not a priority for this organization. A patient can get their records, but only after navigating search engines to find a form that wasn't designed for them.

# Millinocket Regional Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Millinocket Regional Hospital provides a single downloadable PDF form: an **"Authorization to Release Health Care Information"** document hosted on its website since at least 2014. This is the only records-related form found for the organization. There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The sole pathway for a patient requesting records is to download this two-page PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — most likely via fax to the number listed in the form header ((207) 723-3019).

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

The form does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. It is structured entirely around a third-party disclosure model: the patient authorizes "Name of Institution" to disclose records to another "Name of Institution or Person." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. The "reason for release" field offers only "continuing care" or "other (please specify)" — there is no option for "personal records request" or "individual access under HIPAA." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form repurposed for all release scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required persistence. Two generic web searches returned no results; only a site-scoped query (`site:mrhme.org`) succeeded. The form does not appear to be prominently linked from a patient resources or medical records page. The URL path (`/2014/06/`) suggests the document has not been updated in over a decade. Once located, the download was straightforward — no bot blocking or browser fallback needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat PDF with zero fillable fields**. All data entry uses underscore blanks designed for handwriting. The document has a text layer (not a scan) and uses four fonts, but it is fundamentally a print-and-fill artifact. The layout lacks section headers, visual hierarchy, or any design elements beyond bold title text. Record types are presented as an 18-item list (a–r) using an unusual **opt-out approach**: items are released unless crossed out, which uses double-negative logic that could easily confuse patients.

The form covers patient identification, sender/recipient institution, record type selection, reason for release, sensitive information consent (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric), and signature lines — approximately 25 fields across two pages. The language is mostly plain but includes alarming legalese: *"refusal or revocation of permission may result in improper diagnosis or treatment, denial of health benefits or insurance, or other adverse consequences"* — a warning that applies to third-party release scenarios but could discourage a patient exercising their right of access.

## Barriers & Red Flags

The form mandates: *"All spaces on this form MUST be completed for this release to be valid."* This blanket requirement goes beyond HIPAA's authorization elements and could be used to reject forms with trivially missing information. A **witness signature line** is included; combined with the all-fields-mandatory language, this effectively requires a witness — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, no response time is stated, and no delivery format options are offered.

## Bright Spots

The **18-category record-type checklist** provides meaningful granularity, including unusual categories like "Patient Additions" and "Responses to Patients Additions." The **sensitive information consent sections** correctly reference redisclosure restrictions for substance abuse records under 42 CFR Part 2. The form does include a brief patient rights statement acknowledging the right to review records and revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Millinocket Regional Hospital's records request process reflects a facility that has not modernized its patient access pathway. A single generic third-party release form — non-fillable, hard to find, and over a decade old — serves as the only documented mechanism. The form was not designed for patient self-access and contains unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, all-fields-mandatory mandate). While fax submission is available and the form provides good record-type granularity, the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# Good Samaritan Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Good Samaritan Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in West Palm Beach, FL, operated under the Palm Beach Health Network (PBHN), itself part of Tenet Healthcare. The facility offers two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records release — an older facility-specific version (form-1, dated 2014) and a newer network-wide version (form-2, dated 2020). Records requests are processed through Datavant, a third-party ROI vendor, with email submission available. The parent system's medical records page also offers the form in Spanish and Haitian Creole.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

Good Samaritan does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — standard third-party disclosure authorization forms. A patient requesting their own records must name themselves as the "RECIPIENT" (the field asks for "person(s) to whom [the facility] may disclose my health information") and check "Personal Use" under the PURPOSE section. This is functional but unintuitive; the form was clearly designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties, not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. Neither form references the right of access, offers format options for records delivery, or distinguishes self-access from third-party release in any meaningful way.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately surfaced a direct link to form-1 on the hospital's website, and the parent PBHN medical records page linked to form-2 along with Spanish and Haitian Creole versions. However, Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic download, requiring browser-based workarounds. For a typical patient using a browser, this would not be an issue. One source of confusion: both the older facility form and the newer network form are published simultaneously with no guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2, the 2020 network version) is a 2-page print-and-fill PDF with **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring handwriting. The form follows a logical structure — facility selection, demographics, record type checkboxes (20 categories), recipient, term, purpose, super-confidential categories — but is visually dense with small fonts. Notably, form-2 exposes raw mail-merge placeholders in the sidebar (`«PatientNumber»`, `«PatientName»`, `«BirthDate»`, etc.) that are meaningless to patients and appear unprofessional. The form also references a Privacy Office address "listed below" that does not actually appear anywhere on the document — a broken internal reference that prevents patients from exercising their right to revoke authorization.

The language is moderately legalistic. The legal paragraphs on redisclosure, revocation, and treatment conditioning are standard healthcare boilerplate but lack plain-language explanation. The form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for HIPAA identity verification and creates data security risk on a form transmitted via fax or mail.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit via fax (561-650-6467, listed on form-1), email to Datavant (SM-Tenetgoodsamaritan@Datavant.com, per retrieval notes), mail, or in-person pickup. The availability of fax and email means patients are not forced to physically visit the facility, which meets the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers:** SSN collection is unnecessary and potentially deterrent. No fees are disclosed — patients have no visibility into costs before submitting. The form's lack of fillable fields means the entire completion process is paper-based. Form-2 is missing Privacy Office contact information, and its omission of the remuneration disclosure present in form-1 raises compliance questions given Datavant's involvement.

**Bright spots:** Multilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is a genuine strength for the Palm Beach community. The 20+ record-type checkboxes give patients granular control over what is disclosed. Flexible authorization term options (specific date, until fulfilled, until event, until withdrawn) are well-designed. The super-confidential information section on page 2 properly handles Florida state law and 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for sensitive health information categories.

## Overall Assessment

Good Samaritan Medical Center provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all requestors — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access. The forms lack digital fillability, contain confusing internal system artifacts, and collect unnecessary personal information. While multilingual availability and granular record selection are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects a process designed around institutional workflow rather than patient needs. Grade: **C**.

# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Three PDF forms were found for Carle BroMenn Medical Center, a community hospital in Normal, IL that is part of the Carle Health regional system:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary general ROI authorization form specific to the BroMenn/Normal campus (form code X3833-0820). One page. Covers Carle West Physician Group, Carle BroMenn Medical Center, and Carle Eureka Hospital.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A nearly identical system-level Carle Health ROI form for the Champaign campus (form code 174-0319). One page. Same structure but branded for the main Carle campus HIM department.
3. **form-3.pdf** — A behavioral health–specific authorization form for the BroMenn campus (form code X3852-0620). Two pages. Required separately for mental health records per Illinois law.

**Form-1 is the most relevant document** for a patient at Carle BroMenn Medical Center requesting their own general medical records. Form-2 serves the Champaign campus and would likely confuse a BroMenn patient. Form-3 is a companion form needed only for behavioral health records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Carle BroMenn does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" documents designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios. The form uses "To Send to" / "To Request from" framing, requiring patients to navigate a form designed for inter-provider transfers, legal disclosures, and insurance requests. There is no streamlined form or process specifically for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

That said, the form does include some patient-oriented elements: delivery via MyCarle Account (the patient portal), an explicit citation of CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access regulation), and a clear statement that signing is not required for treatment.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches surfaced direct PDF download links on carle.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or multi-step navigation was required. The carle.org medical records page links to the forms. All three were directly downloadable via curl. The only minor friction: a patient might encounter both form-1 (BroMenn-specific) and form-2 (Champaign-specific) without clear guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **digitally-authored but non-fillable PDF**. Despite being created digitally (not a scan), it has zero interactive form fields — every field must be filled by hand after printing. This is a significant missed opportunity. The form is well-organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of release → delivery method → record type selection → legal terms → signature. The granular record-type checkbox grid (30+ categories across hospitalization and clinic columns) gives patients meaningful control over scope. However, the single-page design makes the form cramped, with small font (estimated 8–9pt for legal text) and limited write-in space.

The language is a mix of clear and legalistic. Legal disclaimers are reasonably comprehensible but dense. The "ATTENTION: This is a legal document" warning is somewhat intimidating. There is no plain-language summary.

## Barriers

- **Purpose of disclosure required**: The form requires patients to state why they want their records — a requirement that is potentially non-compliant with HIPAA's Right of Access, which prohibits requiring a reason for patient self-access requests.
- **SSN field not marked optional**: Asks for last 4 digits of SSN without indicating it can be left blank.
- **Paper-only workflow**: No fillable fields, no fax number for submission, no email submission. A patient must print, handwrite, and mail the form or deliver it in person.
- **Behavioral health witness requirement**: Form-3 requires a witness signature for both the authorization and revocation — a barrier not required by HIPAA.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: States "there may be a charge" with no amounts. Form-3 mentions ScanStat as the third-party vendor processing requests.
- **No notarization required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — mail is an option.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyCarle Account electronic delivery** for records (30-day window) provides a digital delivery pathway even though the request itself is paper-based.
- **Explicit HIPAA citation** (CFR 164.524) — uncommon and commendable transparency about patient rights.
- **Granular record-type selection** gives patients fine-grained control over what is released.
- **Easy online findability** of forms with direct download links.
- **Appropriate behavioral health protections** including 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language and age-appropriate consent (12+ for mental health).

## Overall Assessment

Carle BroMenn Medical Center provides a functional but dated records request process. The forms are easy to find and reasonably well-organized, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of electronic submission options, and generic authorization design that doesn't differentiate patient self-access from third-party release hold it back. The purpose-of-disclosure requirement is a compliance concern for patient access requests. The organization earns credit for MyCarle Account delivery, explicit rights citations, and granular scope controls, but the fundamentally paper-based workflow and generic form design place it in the middle of the pack for patient-centeredness.

# Valleywise Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valleywise Health Medical Center, a government-owned independent community hospital in Phoenix, AZ, provides a notably patient-centered approach to medical records access. The organization maintains two distinct PDF forms: a general third-party authorization (Form 43439) and a dedicated patient access request form (Form 45643). This two-form architecture is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement, clearly separating patient self-access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Valleywise Health is among the organizations that get this right. Form 45643 — "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — is explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It does not require the patient to name a third-party recipient, does not include a purpose/reason field, and does not carry an expiration clause — all appropriate design choices for a one-time patient access request. Meanwhile, Form 43439 handles third-party disclosures with the appropriate authorization infrastructure (recipient designation, purpose selection, expiration, revocation rights). The organizational intent to differentiate is clear and well-executed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` returned direct PDF URLs. The organization's patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` also links to the forms. Both PDFs were publicly accessible from a standard WordPress media directory with no bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication. The descriptive filenames (e.g., `Form-45643-Patient-Request-For-Access-To-Protected-Health-Information_ENG_SPA.pdf`) make it clear which form is which.

## Form Document Quality

Form 45643 is a 2-page bilingual PDF (English page 1, full Spanish translation page 2). The layout is clean with a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection → date range → delivery format → recipient information → processing details → signature. The form offers an impressively granular record type selection with 16+ specific categories (discharge summary, H&P, nursing notes, operative reports, pathology, radiology, etc.) plus an "All Records" option. Delivery options include MyChart patient portal, paper copy, CD, USB, email, and fax.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a digitally-authored document. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the form's clean layout would translate well to interactive PDF fields. Submission is available via fax (602-655-9017) and email (ROI@valleywisehealth.org), providing adequate electronic pathways, but the print-and-handwrite step creates friction in an otherwise well-designed process.

The language is plain and accessible throughout, with clear instructions ("Please check (✔) the appropriate box(es) (❑) and fill in the blank(s) as needed") and a patient-friendly tone ("We appreciate your patience while we process your request").

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization, witness, or in-person requirements exist. The form states a HIPAA-compliant 30-day response timeline with a possible 30-day extension. Fee disclosure is vague — "Valleywise Health may charge a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing a fee schedule, though the language about "actual cost of the portable media" aligns with HIPAA's cost-based limits.

Two concerns stand out. First, the form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient access requests and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed or emailed. Second, the Spanish translation references "documento 43780" instead of the correct Form 43439, potentially sending Spanish-speaking patients searching for a nonexistent form.

## Notable Strengths

The standout features are the **full bilingual (English/Spanish) form** — not a summary but a complete parallel translation, appropriate for Phoenix's demographics — the **dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release, and the **granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control over their request scope. The email encryption transparency, defaulting to encryption with an informed opt-out, is a thoughtful touch.

## Overall Assessment

Valleywise Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its medical records access process. The dedicated patient access form, bilingual design, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options reflect genuine attention to the patient experience. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a paper-first completion workflow despite otherwise modern design sensibilities. The SSN field and Spanish-version cross-reference error are notable but secondary concerns. This is a well-designed system with room for straightforward technical improvements.

# Western Washington Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Everett, WA. Three ROI-related documents were retrieved: a primary organization-wide fillable authorization form (form-1), a GI department-specific non-fillable release form (form-2), and a generic unbranded authorization hosted on PatientPop (form-3). Form-1 is clearly the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records and is the basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WWMG does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Western Washington Medical Group to RELEASE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION" — a standard third-party release authorization. Patients requesting their own records use the same form as those authorizing release to an attorney, insurer, or another provider. "Personal (to patient)" appears as one of several purpose checkboxes, annotated with "*service fee may apply." There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal option for record requests. The form does not reference the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish individual access rights from third-party authorization. A patient must navigate a form designed around sending records to someone else and adapt it for self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search returned direct PDF links, and WWMG maintains a dedicated Medical Records Request page (wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/) that links to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or portal requirements were encountered. The URL is descriptive and the form is also listed on the Patient Intake and Registration Forms page. The only complication is the existence of three forms — a patient could potentially encounter the inferior GI-specific (form-2) or orphaned PatientPop form (form-3) instead of the primary one, though the website clearly surfaces form-1.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a single-page fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — well above average for healthcare ROI forms. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → record scope → sensitive information exclusions → purpose → expiration → signature. The language is relatively plain, with direct instructions like "PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE." The scope options are strong, offering four ways to define what records are released (all within 3 years, specific condition, specific dates, or mutual exchange). The sensitive information exclusion section gives patients granular control over HIV, STD, psychiatric, and substance abuse records using an opt-out model with required initials.

The form is not a scan — it was designed digitally with clean text, multiple fonts, and embedded branding. At 143 KB for a single page, it is appropriately sized. WWMG's address is pre-filled, reducing patient burden.

## Submission and Delivery

The form directs patients to "visit wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request and refer to the contact info on the chart" for submission instructions, rather than listing submission options directly on the form. The "OFFICE USE ONLY" section indicates records can be faxed, mailed, or emailed — confirming electronic submission pathways exist. This indirect approach adds a step but avoids restricting patients to in-person delivery. Fax availability means patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or witness signature is required. However, two issues stand out:

1. **Vague fee language**: The "*service fee may apply" note next to "Personal (to patient)" is concerning. HIPAA limits fees for patient access to reasonable, cost-based amounts, and this language provides no specifics, potentially discouraging patients or leading to overcharging.

2. **Misleading "ALL" scope**: The "ALL healthcare information" option is silently limited to the last 3 years. A patient seeking their complete history must use the "Specific DATES" option, but this limitation is not explained. The word "ALL" is misleading.

The 90-day default authorization expiration is adequate for patient access requests (HIPAA requires fulfillment within 30 days with one extension) but creates unnecessary re-authorization burden for ongoing provider exchanges. A conflicting 1-year expiration for the "mutual exchange" option adds confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — genuinely digital-first design
- Single-page format that fits all necessary elements concisely
- Strong scope options with granular sensitive-information exclusion controls
- Multi-clinic awareness field routing requests to the correct WWMG location
- Easy-to-find forms with a dedicated Medical Records Request page

## Overall Assessment

WWMG provides a technically competent, well-designed authorization form that is easy to find and fill out digitally. However, it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — patients must navigate a generic authorization form and select the "Personal" purpose checkbox. The vague fee language for patient access is a compliance concern. The form's document quality and digital-first design are above average, but the lack of a patient-centered access pathway keeps this from being an exemplary practice.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

MUSC Health provides five documents related to medical records release: the current English authorization form (form-1, Rev. 10/2023, 2 pages), an older superseded version (form-2, Version 11, dated 11/2017), a dental-specific variant (form-3, Version 9, dated 5/2019), a MyChart instructions guide (form-4, 4 pages, dated 2017), and a Spanish translation of the current form (form-5). The primary form for patient self-access is form-1, the current "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information."

Critically, MUSC offers three distinct request pathways clearly presented on its medical records page: (1) MyChart Patient Portal for existing portal users, (2) an online eRequest wizard via Ciox/Swellbox for fully digital submission, and (3) manual form download for traditional mail/fax/email submission. This multi-pathway approach gives patients genuine flexibility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MUSC does differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — but at the process level, not the form level. The MyChart instructions document (form-4) explicitly states that MyChart is for patient self-requests, while the HIPAA authorization form should be used "for medical records to be sent directly to a physician office, hospital or third parties." The medical records webpage reinforces this distinction through its tabbed layout.

However, the downloadable PDF form itself (form-1) is a generic HIPAA authorization serving all purposes. "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" is listed as one purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care," "Legal," "Insurance," and others. The form does not distinguish the legal basis, fee structure, or processing rules for patient access under 45 CFR §164.524 versus third-party authorization — even though it cites that regulation. A patient using only the form must navigate a document designed around the third-party release paradigm.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability is excellent. The medical records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and all three pathways are clearly presented. Web searches for MUSC records release forms return direct PDF links. No bot-blocking or access difficulties were encountered. The form URLs are descriptive and intuitive. Both English and Spanish versions are co-located under a clearly labeled section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-authored, text-layered PDF with clean layout and logical flow: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Record Types → SUD Records → Purpose → Date Range → Release Method → Authorization/Consent → Signature. At two pages, the length is appropriate — page one handles all authorization substance, page two provides a useful facility contact directory for nine MUSC Health locations across South Carolina.

The most significant technical shortcoming is that the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being revised in October 2023. Patients must print the PDF and handwrite all entries, then fax, scan-and-email, or mail the completed form. This is a missed opportunity for a major academic medical center's current-revision document.

Record type options are granular and well-designed, including a dedicated Substance Use Disorder section with proper 42 CFR Part 2 citation and opt-in choices. Delivery options include mail, MyChart, fax, and encrypted email. However, the encrypted email option creates confusion: the checkbox says "Encrypted E-mail" but the accompanying consent language warns about "unencrypted e-mail" risks, leaving patients uncertain about what they're authorizing.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — not required by HIPAA — paired with a header warning that "FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION." Together, these could prevent a patient completing the form at home without a witness from submitting it.

Fee language references only South Carolina law ("fees may be charged as provided by S.C. Law") without acknowledging HIPAA's more restrictive cost-based fee limits for patient self-access requests. The MyChart instructions document goes further, stating a blanket fee "for all patient requests" with a prepayment requirement and no disclosed amounts — a notable compliance concern.

The form requires attaching a copy of photo identification, which is reasonable but adds friction for remote submission.

## Strengths

MUSC's standout features include: a **Spanish-language form** that faithfully mirrors the current English version with professional translation quality; **three clearly presented request pathways** including a fully digital portal option (Ciox/Swellbox); a **comprehensive nine-location facility directory** with fax numbers, phone numbers, and dedicated ROI email addresses; **granular SUD records consent** with correct 42 CFR Part 2 citation; and an **explicit citation of 45 CFR §164.524** (patient right of access).

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health demonstrates strong organizational infrastructure for records access — excellent findability, multiple pathways, bilingual support, and process-level differentiation between patient and third-party requests. However, the core downloadable form remains a generic authorization that doesn't center patient self-access, the PDF is not fillable despite a 2023 revision, and compliance details around fees and the witness requirement introduce unnecessary friction. The availability of the Ciox/Swellbox portal partially mitigates the form-level weaknesses by offering patients a fully digital alternative. Overall, this is a competent but not exceptional approach from a well-resourced teaching hospital.

# Scenic Mountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Scenic Mountain Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Big Spring, TX, affiliated with a regional health system. The hospital's medical records page offers two pathways for requesting records: downloadable PDF authorization forms (in English and Spanish) and an electronic request option via a Sharecare/HDS platform. Two PDF forms were retrieved — an English authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are structurally identical general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

The most significant finding is that Scenic Mountain Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. Both PDF forms are titled "Patient Request / Authorization to Use and/or Disclose Protected Health Information," but their structure is that of a standard third-party authorization: Section 2 asks patients to name the recipient ("Person or Facility Name"), requiring a patient requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as both requester and recipient. The "Personal" checkbox under Purpose of Disclosure (Section 8) is the only accommodation for self-access, and there is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. This means patients exercising their individual access rights are funneled through an authorization framework designed for third-party disclosures — a legally distinct process that may result in inappropriate application of authorization-based rules (restricted release signatures, purpose requirements) to what should be a straightforward access request.

The medical records page does mention an electronic request option via a Sharecare/HDS platform, which may provide a more patient-centered digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms do not reflect this differentiation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search for the hospital's medical records release form led directly to the medical records page at `scenicmountainmedical.com/medical-records/`, which provides clear download links for both English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, authentication, or portal login was required. The PDFs are hosted on a secondary WordPress domain (`scenicmountainmedicalcenter.org`), which is slightly confusing from a URL standpoint but transparent to the end user. The page also provides phone and fax contact information.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and return the form. This is a significant missed opportunity: the structured layout with numbered sections, checkboxes, and signature lines would translate well to an interactive PDF.

The form is well-organized with 15 numbered sections following a logical progression: patient identification → recipient → delivery method → date range → record types → restricted release → exclusions → purpose → expiration → legal disclosures → signatures. Section 5 provides 11 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, imaging, discharge summary, etc.) with write-in options, giving patients meaningful control over their request. Section 7 allows patients to exclude specific visits — an uncommon and thoughtful feature.

The legal disclosures on page 2 (Sections 10–13) are dense paragraph-style text that will challenge many readers, but the front-page sections are clear and practical. The bold footer warning — "THIS AUTHORIZATION IS NOT VALID UNLESS ALL APPLICABLE ENTRIES ARE COMPLETED" — could discourage patients who find some sections inapplicable.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form's fee notice ("*fees may apply") is vague, providing no schedule, amounts, or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations for patient access requests. This ambiguity could deter patients. A witness signature line appears next to the patient signature but is not labeled as optional or required — if enforced, this would impose a barrier not required by HIPAA. No notarization is required, and multiple delivery methods (email, postal mail, in-person pickup) are offered. Fax is available for form submission, providing an adequate electronic pathway.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language form**: A fully translated Spanish authorization form is available, appropriately serving the demographics of West Texas. Both language versions are prominently linked on the same page.
- **Email delivery option**: The form includes email as a delivery method — uncommon among facilities and patient-friendly.
- **Granular scope controls**: Patients can select specific record types, specify date ranges, and exclude particular visits.
- **Practical expiration option**: The "until fulfilled" expiration choice is well-suited to one-time patient access requests.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient access differentiation**: The generic authorization framework is the only PDF-based option, conflating two legally distinct HIPAA processes.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form requires printing and handwriting.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: No specifics on costs, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **Translation errors in Spanish form**: A grammatical error in the bold warning text and a duplicate "Ciudad" label where "Estado" should appear undermine the quality of the Spanish version.

## Overall Assessment

Scenic Mountain Medical Center provides an accessible and reasonably well-organized authorization form that is easy to find and available in two languages — a meaningful accommodation for its community. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable PDF format, and vague fee disclosures prevent it from achieving a patient-centered standard. The form serves adequately as a general-purpose authorization but was not designed with the individual patient requesting their own records as the primary use case. **Grade: C (3.30/5.00)**.

# Sturdy Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Sturdy Memorial Hospital (Attleboro, MA) publishes two PDF authorization forms on its website, both titled "Authorization to Release Health Information." Form-1 (updated January 2025, form code SM00081 10/24) is the current, actively maintained version — a 2-page fillable PDF with 59 interactive fields. Form-2 is an older (~2017) legacy version of the same document with zero fillable fields, outdated terminology ("Venereal Disease"), and defunct department references. Form-2 remains publicly accessible, creating a risk that patients download the wrong version. There is no redirect, banner, or other mechanism steering patients to the current form.

No online portal, patient portal integration, or third-party vendor (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was identified for records requests. The only documented pathway is downloading and completing the PDF authorization form, then submitting it — presumably by mail or fax, though the form itself does not specify a submission method. The hospital's mailing address (211 Park Street, PO Box 2963, Attleboro, MA 02703-0963) is listed in the revocation instructions.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Sturdy Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both form versions are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms structured around a three-party model: the patient authorizes Provider A to release records to Provider B. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in the "Release of Protected Health Information To" field — an unintuitive workaround that the form does not explain. The "Purpose of Disclosure" checkboxes include "Personal," the closest match for self-access, but this option is neither highlighted nor explained. The form does not reference the patient's HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), nor does it mention the right to inspect or obtain copies of one's own records as a distinct use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search immediately surfaced both PDFs as direct links on sturdyhealth.org. No website navigation was needed. However, Akamai CDN bot protection blocked programmatic downloads (curl returned "Access Denied"), requiring a browser-based JavaScript workaround to retrieve the raw PDF bytes. This would not affect a typical patient using a web browser but could impede assistive-technology or API-based access.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

The current form is a standout in technical execution. With 59 fillable fields, it is comprehensively interactive — patients can complete the entire form electronically without printing. The PDF is a native digital document (no scanned images, full text layer, 221 KB file size). The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → authorization source/recipient → sensitive information categories → purpose of disclosure → record types → rights → signature. The form uses clear section organization across its 2 pages.

Language is mixed: the rights section uses accessible plain English ("I may refuse to sign this authorization and that such refusal will not affect my health care"), while the sensitive information and disclosure sections are more legalistic. No plain-language summary or introductory guidance is provided. The form is English-only.

Record-type granularity is a notable strength — approximately 14 categories with individual date-range fields (medical record abstract, clinic visit notes, emergency room, lab reports, radiology, pathology, operative reports, etc.), giving patients meaningful control over scope. Sensitive information categories (mental health, HIV/AIDS, STD, sexual assault, substance abuse, genetic testing) require individual initials, respecting Massachusetts law and patient autonomy.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **90-day hard expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signature, with no option to specify a custom date (the older form-2 allowed this). Given HIPAA's 30-day processing window with a possible 30-day extension, this leaves a narrow margin.
- **Ambiguous witness requirement**: A "WITNESS" line appears at the bottom of page 2 with no instructions on whether a witness is required. Patients may unnecessarily delay submission while seeking a witness.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs for records copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No electronic delivery option**: No checkbox for email, portal, or electronic format delivery of the requested records.

## Bright Spots

- **59 fillable fields** — exceptional among ROI forms, most of which have zero interactive fields. Clearly a deliberate digital-first design decision.
- **Granular record-type selection** with ~14 categories and date ranges.
- **Individual sensitive-information consent** via initials for each category.
- **Active form maintenance** — the January 2025 update shows ongoing attention.
- **No notarization requirement**, no consent bundling, and clear right-to-refuse language.

## Overall Assessment

Sturdy Memorial Hospital delivers a technically excellent form that falls short on patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF with granular record selection is among the best form documents in its class, but the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway means patients must navigate a third-party release form to exercise their Right of Access. The form's structure, language, and field design all orient toward provider-to-provider or provider-to-insurer disclosure rather than patient self-access. Combined with ambiguities around witness requirements, submission methods, and a restrictive expiration, the experience is functional but not patient-centered.

# Cordova Community Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cordova Community Medical Center (CCMC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Cordova, Alaska. It offers a single Release of Information form for all medical records requests — a one-page, general-purpose HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

CCMC provides one pathway for records requests: a downloadable PDF authorization form linked from the Medical Records page at `https://www.cdvcmc.com/for-patients/medical-records/`. The form can be printed, completed by hand, and faxed to Medical Records at (907) 424-8406 or the Clinic Nurse at (907) 424-8202. No online submission portal, email submission option, or patient portal alternative exists. The website's Medical Records page reportedly discusses format options for receiving records (paper, email, CD, or fax), but the form itself does not capture a delivery format preference.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

CCMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured around "Release my information to [NAME]" — a third-party release frame. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in the recipient field and select "Personal reasons" as the purpose, which is unintuitive. The purpose checkboxes ("Continuation of care," "Insurance purposes," "Employer requirement," "Legal review") are overwhelmingly third-party scenarios. While technically usable for patient self-access, the form was clearly designed around the third-party authorization model, not individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The Medical Records page is intuitively located under "For Patients" and links directly to the form download. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, authentication, or portal login was encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a flat (non-fillable) PDF — digitally authored with a proper text layer, but with zero interactive fields. Patients must print and handwrite all entries. At one page and approximately 15 fields (patient name, DOB, MR#, recipient name/address/phone, purpose checkboxes, record type checkboxes, date range, sensitive information initial, signature, and date), the scope is reasonable. The layout uses a numbered section structure (1–7) that flows logically from authorization through scope, limitations, revocation, rights, and signature. However, the dense legal text in sections 3–7 and the redisclosure notice create a visually cramped single page. Three fonts provide some typographic hierarchy. The language shifts from accessible in the early sections to regulatory legalese in the later sections, particularly around revocation and redisclosure.

Section 2 offers excellent record-type granularity — twelve specific categories plus "Other" and date-range fields — giving patients meaningful control over what is released. Section 7's acceptance of photocopies as originals is a practical accommodation.

## Barriers

No notarization is required. Photo ID "may be required" — stated as a possibility, not an absolute mandate. No fees are mentioned on the form. The form expires three months from signature, which is short but sufficient for a single access request. There is no stated turnaround time on the form itself.

A notable concern is Section 3's all-or-nothing handling of sensitive information: alcohol/drug abuse, HIV-AIDS, mental health, and psychiatric treatment are bundled into a single initial, with an undefined "qualify above" alternative. This is problematic given the form's own citation of 42 CFR Part 2 protections for substance abuse records, which require specific consent for each disclosure.

The form's 45 CFR 164.524 citation is misapplied — used in the redisclosure context rather than to inform patients of their access rights. The form was last updated in 2016, making it nearly a decade old.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:** Excellent findability; compact single-page design; comprehensive record-type selection; photocopies accepted; fax submission available (adequate electronic pathway).

**Weaknesses:** Not fillable; does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release; sensitive information bundling; stale document (2016); delivery format not captured on form; legal language in later sections.

## Overall Assessment

CCMC provides a functional but dated records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it was designed for third-party release rather than patient self-access. The non-fillable format and print-fax workflow reflect a paper-first mindset. For a small, remote critical access hospital, the form is adequate but falls short of patient-centered design. A patient can navigate the process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary user.

# Olmsted Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Olmsted Medical Center (OMC) is an independent nonprofit physician practice in Rochester, MN. Two forms were found on the organization's website: a primary "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (form-1) and a companion "Authorization for Allowing Verbal Communication of Protected Health Information" (form-2). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records; form-2 is limited to authorizing verbal discussions with a designated person and explicitly disclaims any written record release.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

OMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. The primary form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, employers, and others. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this generic form: they fill in OMC's address in the "Release Information From" field (pre-populated) and put their own name and address in the "Release Information To" field. The form includes a "Personal" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which at least provides a recognizable option, but there is no guidance text explaining how a patient should complete the form for self-access specifically. The form does not differentiate between individual access rights under § 164.524 and third-party authorization under § 164.508.

That said, the form does reference "CRF 164.524" (a typo for CFR) and includes a strong non-conditioning statement — both patient-protective elements that go beyond what many generic authorization forms include.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. OMC hosts a dedicated "Manage Your Health Information" page accessible through clear website navigation (Patients & Visitors > Your Care & Visit > Manage Your Health Information). Multiple search strategies — filetype:pdf queries, site-scoped searches, and direct navigation — all led to the form quickly. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot blocking, which prevented programmatic downloads via curl but would not affect a patient using a browser. The page also lists Spanish and Somali translations, MyChart proxy access forms, and the verbal communication authorization form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **62 interactive form fields** — a truly digital-first design, not a scan or print-only document. The layout uses a clean left-column label / right-column field structure with clearly delineated sections: patient demographics, release from/to, method of disclosure, date range, record type selection (a granular checkbox grid), reason for release, authorization/expiration, revocation rights, and signature. The language is mostly plain and functional, though the opening line — "This is a legal document" — may intimidate some patients. The authorization section includes standard but dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation.

Delivery options include mail, pick up, fax (marked "Urgent Only — limitations may apply"), and patient portal (also with "limitations may apply"). The inclusion of patient portal delivery is a positive signal, though the unexplained "limitations" qualifiers create uncertainty. Submission methods include any OMC location, postal mail, or fax (507.287.2777), with a phone number for questions. Fax availability means a patient can submit without visiting in person or relying on postal mail.

## Barriers and Compliance

OMC imposes no unusual barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no upfront fee disclosure. The one-year default authorization expiration is standard. Revocation rights are clearly stated and require written notice to the Health Information Department. The form explicitly references the patient's right to inspect or receive copies under CFR 164.524 and states that OMC will not condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility on signing the authorization — a strong compliance posture.

Minor issues include two typos ("CRF" for "CFR" and "provide" for "provided"), an inconsistent mailing address between form-1 and form-2, and the unexplained "limitations may apply" qualifiers on fax and portal delivery. The "File Only — No Records Needed at this time" option in the delivery section is an internal administrative option that may confuse patients.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in English, Spanish, and Somali — the Somali translation is notably community-responsive for Rochester, MN
- **62 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive digital form, uncommon in healthcare ROI
- **Patient portal delivery option** alongside traditional methods
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference** and non-conditioning statement — unusually transparent about patient rights
- **Clean single-page design** that fits comprehensive content without feeling cramped

## Overall Assessment

Olmsted Medical Center delivers a technically strong, well-organized, and accessible ROI form that is easy to find and free of significant barriers. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must use a generic third-party authorization form and figure out how to adapt it for their own purposes. Despite this, the form's quality, fillability, multilingual support, and compliance posture make it a solid option for patients. The organization earns a **B** grade: strong document quality and accessibility, held back by the generic-form-for-all-purposes approach to patient access.

# Synthesis: Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center

## Overview

Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Far Rockaway, NY. Three documents were found on the organization's website: the primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a bilingual patient exit survey (form-2), and a general HIPAA consent/NPP acknowledgment form (form-3). Only form-1 functions as an actual records request authorization.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Addabbo does not offer a pathway designed specifically for patient self-access. The sole records request mechanism is **OCA Official Form No. 960**, a New York State standard "Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA." This is a general-purpose third-party authorization form — originally designed for litigation — that patients must repurpose when requesting their own records. The form includes "At request of individual" as one checkbox among several reasons for release, but it does not distinguish between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party seeking records. The instruction page explicitly states the form was designed for "release of health information needed for litigation in New York State courts" and "can, however, be used more broadly."

The form does not reference the patient's right to receive their own records, does not offer format or delivery options (electronic, paper, CD), and does not mention a patient portal. It collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient self-access and creates privacy risk.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. The organization's website has a dedicated Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`) accessible through the "For Patients" navigation menu. However, the forms are hosted on a third-party platform (Practice Builders / `pbformsonline.com`) via a JavaScript-based PDF viewer, requiring browser DevTools inspection to obtain the actual PDF download URL. A patient could fill the form within the embedded viewer, but downloading for offline completion requires technical sophistication.

A potential confusion point: the Patient Forms page labels form-3 as "HIPAA Consent to Release Information," which could mislead patients into downloading a registration consent form instead of the actual ROI authorization.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **fillable PDF** with 25 interactive fields, though none have accessible name attributes (degrading screen reader usability). The form is 2 pages — one page of authorization content and one page of litigation-context instructions. This is appropriately concise.

The form's structure front-loads six numbered legal disclosures (HIV redisclosure warnings, revocation rights, voluntariness) before any patient-fillable fields, creating a dense, legalistic opening. The language throughout is complex — written for attorneys, not patients. Item 6's all-caps restriction on discussing health information "WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SPECIFIED IN ITEM 9(b)" is confusing in a non-litigation context.

A notable bright spot: Addabbo added a **typed-signature acceptance clause**, allowing patients to complete and sign the form digitally without printing. This is a meaningful accommodation for remote submission. The form also provides a clear enumeration of what "entire medical record" includes and granular opt-in initialing for sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug treatment, mental health, HIV).

## Barriers

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number — unnecessary for patient self-access and a privacy risk.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. While this avoids imposing excessive fees, it also doesn't inform patients of their cost-limited rights.
- **No submission method specified on form**: The form itself does not indicate how to submit. The website context and Practice Builders platform provide some guidance, but submission via fax or in-person delivery appears to be expected.
- **Exit survey co-location**: The "We're Listening" exit survey (form-2) is posted alongside the ROI form on the Medical Records page, framing all records requests as patient transfers. If presented as a companion requirement, this could function as an implicit barrier. The survey contains pervasive Spanish translation errors.

## Bright Spots

- Typed-signature acceptance removes the print-sign-scan barrier
- Explicit enumeration of medical record contents gives patients clarity
- Granular sensitive-information opt-in via initialing
- Bilingual exit survey (despite translation quality issues) reflects community awareness
- Dedicated Medical Records page with direct link to the ROI form

## Overall Assessment

Addabbo provides a functional but imperfect pathway for patient records access. The organization relies on a state-standard litigation authorization form rather than creating a patient-centered access process. The form is fillable with typed-signature support — a meaningful digital accommodation — but the legalistic language, SSN collection, litigation framing, and lack of patient access rights language place the experience squarely in "adequate but not designed for you" territory. The retrieval experience is reasonable, though the third-party form hosting and confusingly labeled companion documents create unnecessary friction.

# AdventHealth Central Texas — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Central Texas is a nonprofit community hospital in Killeen, TX, part of the major AdventHealth system. Two ROI forms were found: a system-wide authorization form (form-1, ADV-800003A, rev. 2022) and a facility-specific "Request For Access And Authorization" form (form-2, AHCT 616, rev. 2005). Both were easily discoverable via web search, downloaded directly from the AdventHealth CDN with no barriers.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The facility-specific form (form-2) is the more relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. It explicitly includes a checkbox for "Provide me with access to the protected health information specified below" as its first option — a clear patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party disclosure. The system-wide form (form-1), by contrast, is architecturally a third-party disclosure form that funnels all requests through a "Disclose To" entity-naming structure. While it lists "Personal Use" as a purpose, a patient would need to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient.

The existence of both forms creates a "which form?" problem. Neither form references the other, and no landing page was found that explains when to use which. A patient could reasonably download the system-wide form first and never discover the more patient-friendly facility-specific version. That said, the facility-specific form does meaningfully differentiate patient access from third-party release — it presents four distinct action options (access, copies, disclosure to others, summary) rather than treating everything as a third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search for "AdventHealth Central Texas authorization release health information medical records form PDF" surfaced both PDFs immediately. No bot blocking, login walls, or navigation mazes were encountered. The forms are hosted on AdventHealth's CDN at direct URLs. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — full marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are digitally created PDFs with extractable text — neither is a scan. However, **neither form has any fillable/interactive fields** (both have zero fillable fields per metadata). Every field must be completed by hand after printing. This is a significant gap, especially for the system-wide form revised as recently as 2022. The "Affix Patient Label Here" boxes on form-2 further signal a paper-first, in-facility design never adapted for remote digital use.

Form-2 (the primary patient access form) is 2 pages with approximately 20–25 fields. The first page is reasonably organized: action checkboxes, patient demographics, record type selection (12 categories plus catch-alls), and a disclosure recipient section. The second page is a dense block of legal "I understand..." statements followed by signature blocks. The legal language is moderately formal but comprehensible. However, the lack of bullet points or visual separation in the legal text makes it harder to parse.

The system-wide form (form-1) is more complex, with 12 numbered sections spanning 48+ checkbox options across medical/surgical and behavioral health record types. It is visually overwhelming for a routine records request.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-2 requires a witness signature for all requests — not just behavioral health records. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access, making this an unnecessary barrier for patients completing the form at home.

**Fees**: Form-2 mentions a "reasonable, cost-based fee" but provides no specific amounts or fee schedule. The summary option pre-fills a blank for cost, setting an expectation of charges without transparency.

**90-day authorization cap**: Form-2 limits authorization to a maximum of 90 days, which is restrictive and conflates patient access requests (which don't require authorization under HIPAA) with third-party disclosure authorization.

**Wrong state law**: Form-1 references the "Illinois Mental Health and Development Disabilities Confidentiality Act" despite being served at a Texas facility — a clear legal citation error from a system-wide template not adapted for local jurisdiction.

**No notarization required**: Neither form requires notarization. Submission can be done by fax (254-526-7134) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit patient access pathway**: Form-2's first checkbox is "Provide me with access to the protected health information" — a rarity that centers patient self-access.
- **Broad catch-all category**: Form-2 includes "Any other personally identifiable information used by AdventHealth Central Texas to make medical decisions about me" — an unusually expansive request option.
- **Local contact information**: Form-2 provides facility-specific phone and fax numbers, unlike the generic system form.
- **Secure email delivery option**: Form-1 offers secure email as a delivery method, more progressive than fax-only alternatives.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: Both forms correctly state that refusing to sign will not affect treatment or benefits.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Central Texas offers a mixed experience. On the positive side, the facility-specific form includes genuine patient access language and the forms are trivially easy to find online. On the negative side, neither form is fillable, the facility form is over 20 years old, a witness signature creates unnecessary friction, and the two-form landscape creates confusion about which to use. The organization earns credit for having a patient access pathway at all — many peers offer only generic third-party authorization forms — but the execution falls short of modern standards for digital accessibility and form hygiene.

# Blessing Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Blessing Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Quincy, Illinois, part of Blessing Health System. Five documents were retrieved — three superseded English versions (April 2023 and 2015), the current English authorization form (September 2025), and a current Spanish translation. The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf**, the September 2025 English "BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information," which is directly linked from the organization's Medical Records page alongside its Spanish counterpart (form-5.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Blessing Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary pathway is a **generic HIPAA authorization form** used for all releases of information — patient self-access, third-party disclosures, insurance, legal, and care transfers alike. The form uses bidirectional "RELEASE RECORDS FROM" / "RECORDS GOING TO" fields designed for inter-party transfers. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively authorizing the release of records from Blessing to themselves. The purpose options include "Personal reasons," which accommodates patient requests but does not distinguish them legally or procedurally from third-party authorization.

Notably, the retrieval notes indicate that Blessing Health also offers an **online records request tool** with identity verification via driver's license photo, mentioned on the Medical Records webpage. This provides a parallel digital pathway, though the PDF form remains the primary documented route.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Blessing Hospital authorization forms immediately returned direct PDF links, and the Medical Records page at blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords is well-organized under "For Patients > Request Medical Records." The one concern is version sprawl: three outdated English versions (from 2015 and April 2023) remain accessible at their original URLs with no deprecation notices or redirects. A patient arriving via a cached search result could unknowingly download a superseded form — including one that still requires a witness signature the organization has since eliminated.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4.pdf) is a **digitally authored, non-fillable 2-page PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks must be filled by hand after printing; circle instructions ("(Circle) Pick up or Mail or Fax or Email") reveal its print-first design. Despite this, the form is well-structured: patient demographics flow into records source/destination, then record type checkboxes (15 specific categories plus "Other"), sensitive information authorization, purpose, legal disclosures, and signatures. A dedicated page 2 provides **field-by-field completion guidelines** with plain-language examples — a genuine standout feature that most organizations omit.

The language is a mix: legal boilerplate on the authorization side is moderately dense, but the guidelines page compensates with concrete, accessible explanations. One persistent grammatical issue ("I authorize the use or disclosure of the above named individual's health information, its employees and agents, to furnish") creates ambiguity about who is authorizing what.

## Barriers and Compliance

The September 2025 revision made a significant improvement by **removing the witness signature requirement** that was present in the April 2023 versions — a barrier the organization itself recognized as unnecessary. No notarization is required. Photo identification "may be required," using permissive rather than mandatory language. The form does not disclose fees, though the website mentions a $6.50 flat fee for certain requests; HIPAA requires patients to be informed of fees before authorizing. The mandatory date range requirement ("MUST specify date range") could create friction for patients seeking comprehensive records. Submission can be made via mail or **fax** to three listed locations (Blessing Health System, Blessing Health Hannibal, and Denman Services), so patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

Blessing Hospital demonstrates several above-average practices: a **Spanish translation** linked alongside the English form, the detailed **completion guidelines** on page 2, **email as a delivery option**, active form improvement (witness requirement removal), and an **online records request tool** as an alternative pathway. The form is managed through PolicyStat, suggesting systematic version control.

## Overall Assessment

Blessing Hospital earns a **B** grade. The organization provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with helpful instructions and a Spanish translation — above average for a community hospital. However, the generic authorization design means patients requesting their own records must navigate a form not designed for them, and the non-fillable PDF format creates a paper-dependent workflow. The availability of an online records request tool and fax submission partially compensate for the print-and-fill form, but the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway and the absence of fee disclosure on the form itself are notable gaps.

# Adena Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Adena Regional Medical Center, a nonprofit community hospital in Chillicothe, Ohio and part of the Adena Health System, provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests. The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — patients requesting their own records must navigate the same form designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. Three documents were found on the organization's medical records request page: two versions of the same ROI authorization form (one current, one outdated) and a fee schedule.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf** (CLI.1777, Rev. 10/25), a one-page "Authorization: Release of Information Form" that serves as the current version. An older version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/02/2020) is also linked from the same page under "Option 3 – By Mail or Fax," creating confusion about which form to use. The fee schedule (form-3.pdf) is a supplementary document published as an image-only scan with no text layer.

Submission is available by mail or fax. Form-2 explicitly lists the fax number (740-779-7769) and mailing address; form-1 does not include a fax number, an oversight that may force patients to hunt for contact information. No online portal submission for records requests was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Adena does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both form versions use a three-way checkbox ("Obtain records from / Release records to / Exchange verbal information with") oriented toward third-party disclosure flows. A patient requesting their own records would need to check "Release records to" and enter their own name as recipient — a non-obvious workflow. The form includes "Personal" as a purpose-of-disclosure option, which is a helpful signal, but there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or any language distinguishing patient-access requests from third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search for the medical records release form surfaced the dedicated medical records request page at `/patients-and-visitors/patient-rights/medical-records-request` on the first attempt. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. All PDFs were directly downloadable. The page is logically located under "Patient Rights," reachable in approximately three clicks from the homepage.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created, text-based PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand (or use a third-party PDF annotation tool). The form fits on a single page, which is commendable for brevity, but the layout is cramped as a result. Sections flow logically (demographics → direction → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → rights → signature), though there are no formal section headers. The record type selection is comprehensive, offering 14 options including an "Abstract" bundle. Language is moderately legalistic, particularly in the "I understand the following" rights section. An "Administrative Use Only – Driver's license number" field at the very top may confuse patients into thinking it's required.

A notable positive: the form explicitly offers electronic delivery of records via email, putting it ahead of many peers. However, no encryption or secure delivery mechanism is mentioned.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is a **witness signature requirement** — HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient authorizations, and a patient filling out the form at home would need to find a witness, potentially discouraging submission. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which is common but not required by HIPAA and raises data security concerns.

Fee language is problematic: the form states charges "WILL" apply "in accordance with Ohio Law" without distinguishing patient-access requests (subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee cap) from third-party releases (subject to potentially higher state rates). The fee schedule is published proactively on the medical records page — a positive practice — but as an image-only scan it is inaccessible to screen readers, translation tools, and text search.

The psychotherapy notes checkbox requires "approval by psychotherapist," which is appropriate for third-party release but would constitute an impermissible barrier if applied to patient self-access requests.

## Overall Assessment

Adena Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and concise, with some thoughtful features like electronic delivery and comprehensive record type options. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party-oriented design, the witness signature requirement, and ambiguous fee language collectively create a process that works for patients who are persistent but was clearly not designed with patient self-access as a priority. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate but with meaningful room for improvement in both form design and patient-centeredness.

# UW Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UW Medical Center, part of the UW Medicine system (University of Washington), provides a single ROI form for all of its facilities: "Patient Authorization to Disclose, Release, and/or Obtain Protected Health Information" (form U0626, version V.2512, last approved December 2025). This 3-page fillable PDF covers Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center (Montlake and Northwest campuses), UW Medicine Primary Care, and UW Physicians. No separate patient-access-specific form exists — this is a generic HIPAA authorization serving both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UW Medicine does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from third-party authorization. The single form handles all release scenarios — attorneys, providers, insurers, and patients alike. The "Purpose of Request" section includes a "Personal" checkbox, and the "Recipient of Records" field lists "Patient" as one example alongside "Insurance Company, Attorney, Physician." A patient can certainly use this form, but the framing treats self-access as one option among many rather than a first-class use case.

However, UW Medicine partially compensates with an outstanding **MyChart fast-track**: the form opens with a prominent callout — *"Recent medical records are available via MyChart for immediate download without filling out this form"* — and page 3 elaborates with instructions and a URL. The form also notes that an electronic request form is available within MyChart as an alternative. This effectively creates a two-tier system: MyChart for recent records (instant, self-service), and the paper authorization for everything else.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. Web searches for UW Medical Center ROI terms immediately surfaced it, and the UW Medicine website's Patient Forms page links directly to the canonical URL on the UW compliance site (`depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf`). One complication: the uwmedicine.org CDN blocks programmatic downloads (403 errors), but since the official patient forms page links to the compliance-hosted version, patients following the normal path encounter no issues. No browser fallback was needed for the working URL.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-designed interactive PDF with **61 fillable fields**, a full text layer, and 10 embedded fonts — clearly a digital-first document, not a scan. The layout follows a logical **numbered structure** (Items #1–7): patient information, purpose, facility selection, recipient, record types, format preferences, and expiration. This is easy to follow and a patient could complete it without assistance.

**Language** is mostly plain and accessible, though the patient rights section on page 2 includes a dense legal paragraph about conditioning treatment on authorization that would challenge many readers. Page 3 provides item-by-item **completion instructions** — an unusual and genuinely helpful addition that sets this form apart.

**Delivery format options** are exceptional: CD/DVD, Paper, MyChart, USB/Thumb Drive, and Email — five choices, more than nearly any other provider form. **Submission channels** are equally strong: postal mail, fax ((206) 744-9997), and email (uwmedroi@uw.edu), with separate contacts for billing records.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. There is **no notarization or witness requirement**, no in-person submission mandate, and no fee disclosure on the form (neither a stated fee nor a stated exemption). The 3-year default authorization expiration is generous. Revocation requires a written request to the Compliance Office — standard but could be more accessible.

One ambiguity: the form includes a blanket statement that the authorization "permits UW Medicine to release information related to sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, behavioral or mental health services, and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse," which could confuse patients about whether signing automatically releases all sensitive categories.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart fast-track** at the top of the form actively diverts patients to faster self-service
- **Five delivery formats** give patients genuine choice
- **Three submission channels** (mail, fax, email) with complete contact information
- **Instruction page** with item-by-item guidance and honest expectations about record completeness
- **Multi-facility coverage** via a single form with clear facility checkboxes
- **Sensitive information opt-in model** for specific unit records (sexual assault, mental health, living donor)

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access form — generic authorization serves all purposes
- No mention of HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or fee limits for patient access
- "PLACE PATIENT LABEL HERE" hospital artifact may confuse patients filling out at home
- Fillable field names are empty in metadata, potentially indicating accessibility deficiencies for screen readers

## Overall Assessment

UW Medical Center provides a **competent, well-designed generic authorization form** with strong digital capabilities and multiple submission options. The MyChart promotion is a standout patient-centering feature that partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway. The form's thorough instruction page, granular record selection, and five delivery formats demonstrate genuine care for usability. The main gap is structural: patients requesting their own records navigate the same form designed for attorneys and insurers, with no acknowledgment that their rights and fee protections differ. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and mostly patient-friendly, but not designed around patient self-access as a primary use case.

# UCSF Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UCSF Medical Center offers a single ROI form — the "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (756-020Zi, Rev. 04/22) — available in both English and Spanish. Two English PDF URLs exist (form-1 and form-2 contain identical text; form-2 at `/pdf/roi-authorization.pdf` is the current canonical version linked from the Medical Records page). The Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 05/22) is also directly linked. The UCSF Health Medical Records page (`ucsfhealth.org/medical-records`) additionally mentions MyChart as an alternative pathway for accessing records and discloses fees ($0.25/page paper, $25 electronic).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

UCSF does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. The authorization form is a general-purpose release designed for any disclosure — from continuity of care to billing to third-party requests. A patient wanting their own records must fill in both the "I authorize [source]" and "to release health information to [recipient]" fields, effectively authorizing release *to themselves*. While "At the request of the patient/patient representative" is available as a purpose checkbox, the form makes no distinction between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party requesting records. There is no mention of HIPAA's individual access right, no response-time commitment, and no EHI export option. MyChart provides a separate digital pathway, but the PDF form is the primary documented process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. The first web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link. The UCSF Health website has a clean, well-organized Medical Records page that links to both language versions, describes the process, and discloses fees. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-only rendering was encountered. The only minor wrinkle is two English URLs serving essentially identical PDFs, which could confuse a patient who finds the older link via search.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-crafted, digitally-authored 2-page PDF** with 39 fillable interactive fields. It is not a scan — it has a clean text layer, uses 14 fonts, and includes no embedded images. An accessibility note ("Made accessible 12/18" on form-1; "Made accessible 7/23" on form-3) confirms deliberate remediation for assistive technology. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → source/destination → purpose → record types → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Parenthetical examples for each record type (e.g., "Entire Hospital Record (e.g. History and physical, consult, operative report, discharge summary…)") help patients understand their options. The sensitive-information section correctly requires separate opt-in for substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing records, with California statute citations.

However, there are quality issues: a typo ("specifcally") appears in both English versions, and the Spanish version has three spelling errors ("fnalidad," "específca," "tratatmiento") plus a missing radiology request section that exists in the English versions — a meaningful content gap for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no excessive barriers**: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person submission mandate. Fees are disclosed on the website (not the form) at $0.25/page or $25 electronic — within HIPAA limits. The "Your Rights" section clearly states the authorization is voluntary, explains revocation rights, and notes the right to a copy.

The primary submission gap is that **general (non-radiology) requests must be mailed** to physical addresses in San Francisco or Oakland. Only radiology requests have fax and email submission options. The form itself provides no electronic submission path for general authorizations, creating a workflow disconnect: a patient can fill the form digitally but must then print and mail it.

## Overall Assessment

UCSF Medical Center earns credit for form findability, document quality, Spanish-language availability, and clean sensitive-information handling. The main weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients navigate a generic third-party release form), the mail-only submission requirement for general requests, and quality control gaps in the Spanish translation. The org demonstrates institutional attention to accessibility and transparency, but has not yet designed its records request process around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Synthesis: Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers

## Overview

Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers (Philadelphia, PA) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC historically focused on HIV/AIDS care. The organization maintains a well-organized "Forms and Consents" page on its website with direct PDF download links, offering forms in both English and Spanish. Two ROI-related forms were found: a dedicated patient access form (form-1) and a separate third-party authorization form (form-2).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Philadelphia FIGHT stands out by maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access and third-party release** — a best practice that many larger organizations fail to implement. Form-1, titled "Patient Request for Access to Information," is explicitly designed for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524). It opens with a clear rights statement and deals exclusively with the patient's own records. Form-2, the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Information," is a standard § 164.508 authorization for third-party disclosures. This structural separation means patients requesting their own records are not funneled through a generic authorization workflow designed for insurers, attorneys, or other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Forms and Consents page is accessible via the main navigation (About → Forms and Consents) and was surfaced quickly by a site-specific web search. Direct PDF download links with descriptive text ("Request for Access to Information Form") made identification easy. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or other technical obstacles were encountered. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-fill or PDF annotation workarounds. This is a meaningful gap given that the form was clearly authored digitally (7 fonts, embedded logo) and could easily have been made interactive.

The form's structure follows a logical flow: patient identification, scope of request (entire medical record, billing record, or specific records), access method (copy vs. inspection), format preference (paper or electronic with a "Specify" field), delivery method (pick up or mail), and requester identification (self, guardian, or representative). At one page, it is appropriately concise.

The language is moderately complex. The introductory paragraph front-loads legal information about timelines, fees, and denial rights in dense prose. While accurate, it could be more accessible if broken into bullet points. The form does not use explicit section headers beyond the internal-use divider.

## Submission Methods

Form-1 lists four submission channels: in-person, email (privacy@fight.org), fax (215-732-1145), and mail. The inclusion of **email submission** is a notable strength — many organizations limit submission to fax and mail. A patient can complete and submit the form without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **Fee language is vague**: The form describes four categories of chargeable costs (labor, supplies, postage, summary preparation) but provides no dollar amounts, fee schedule, or cost estimates. Costs are billed after fulfillment, with no mechanism for a patient to learn the cost in advance or set a spending limit.
- **No mention of right to appeal a denial**: The form states FIGHT may deny access but does not inform the patient of their right to request review of a denial, which HIPAA requires for reviewable denials under § 164.524(d)(4).
- **Response timeline stated**: 30 days, with possible 60-day extension — consistent with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **Email submission option** in addition to fax, mail, and in-person — a low-barrier digital channel.
- **Electronic format option** with an open "Specify" field, respecting the patient's right to choose format.
- **Adolescent self-access at age 13+**, reflecting Pennsylvania minor consent law.
- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) on the Forms and Consents page.
- **Sensitive information opt-out** on the third-party form, with granular categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) — especially relevant for this organization's patient population.

## Overall Assessment

Philadelphia FIGHT delivers an above-average patient access experience among FQHCs. The structural decision to separate patient access from third-party authorization is the standout feature, demonstrating clear understanding of HIPAA's distinct provisions. The form is concise, logically organized, and offers multiple submission channels including email. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a print-and-fill workflow), vague fee disclosures, and the omission of denial appeal rights. With relatively modest improvements — adding fillable fields and clarifying fees — this organization could achieve an excellent rating.

# Pocahontas Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Pocahontas Memorial Hospital (PMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Buckeye, West Virginia. Two PDF forms were found on the hospital's Medical Records page: a general-purpose **Authorization for Release of Medical Information** (form-1, 2 pages) and a narrowly scoped **COVID-19 Testing Authorization** (form-2, 1 page). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own records; form-2 is a pandemic-era authorization for releasing COVID test results to employers or schools.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Form

PMH does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole route for a patient requesting their own records is the generic HIPAA authorization form (form-1), which is designed to handle all release scenarios — personal use, insurance, attorneys, and other third parties. The form does include "Personal use" as the first option under Purpose of Disclosure, and a patient can name themselves as the recipient, but the overall structure (recipient fields, entity authorization, third-party delivery options) is oriented toward release to others. There is no separate patient access request form, online portal, or patient portal–based request workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A general web search for PMH authorization forms returned generic template sites rather than the hospital's own link. A site-scoped search (`site:pmhwv.org`) succeeded, and the form is linked from a logical location: Patients and Visitors > Medical Records. Bot protection on the website blocked direct programmatic (curl) downloads, requiring a browser-based workaround. A patient navigating the website directly would find the form in 2–3 clicks, which is reasonable for a small facility.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring the patient to print and handwrite. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, record type selection (about 10 checkbox options), date range, sensitive information opt-outs, purpose of disclosure, recipient information, and delivery preferences. The logical flow is sensible: patient info → what to release → purpose → recipient → delivery → authorization → signature.

Layout is functional but minimal. There are no bold section headers, boxed regions, or strong visual hierarchy beyond the document title and some capitalized labels. The sensitive information opt-out section is a dense paragraph with inline initial-lines that could be difficult to parse. Language is a mix of plain phrasing and standard legal boilerplate; the authorization paragraph on page 2 is a single dense block. A notable text encoding defect drops the "ti" ligature throughout the PDF (rendering "Patient" as "Pa ent," "authorization" as "authoriza on," etc.), which breaks screen readers and text search — a significant accessibility flaw.

## Submission Methods & Delivery Options

The form offers multiple submission and delivery options: in-person pickup (self or authorized representative), US Mail, fax (304-799-2276), and email. Format options explicitly include Paper and Electronic (email, USB, CD, Portal, other). This is a notably comprehensive set of electronic delivery options for a small critical access hospital. Since fax is available, a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Compliance

**No notarization required** — only a patient signature. The form includes a clear **non-conditioning statement** ("may not condition its providing of health care on whether copies... are released"), an unusual and commendable inclusion for a small rural facility. A **30-day response time** is stated, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Revocation and re-disclosure language are present and standard.

However, the form states **"Photo ID is required"** as a blanket requirement without clarifying whether this applies only to in-person pickup or also to mailed/faxed requests — a potential barrier for remote patients. **Fee disclosure is vague**: "All other requestors are charged as state and federal laws allow" provides no specific amounts, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. These are not dealbreakers but reflect areas where the form could better serve patients.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Electronic format options explicitly listed (email, USB, CD, Portal); multiple delivery methods; non-conditioning statement included; 30-day response time stated; logical form flow.

**Red flags**: Zero fillable fields despite being digitally created; blanket photo ID requirement; vague fee disclosure; systematic text encoding defect affecting accessibility; "Snowshoe Mountain Clinic" listed as a record type alongside clinical categories (confusing).

## Overall Assessment

PMH provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of a small independent critical access hospital. The form is findable, logically organized, and offers commendable delivery flexibility. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, zero fillable fields, and several barrier concerns prevent it from rising above average. The form adequately serves a patient who knows what they need, but it wasn't designed with the patient self-access use case as a priority.

# Natividad Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Natividad Medical Center, a government-owned community hospital in Salinas, CA, hosts two ROI authorization forms on its medical records page at `https://www.natividad.com/medical-records/`:

- **Form 1** (2019): A 1-page "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — an image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields. Despite being the newer version, it is a grayscale scan at 200 DPI that cannot be read by screen readers or completed digitally.
- **Form 2** (2007): A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" created from Microsoft Word. It has a text layer but is copy-protected (RC4 encryption) and also lacks fillable fields. It requests Social Security Number and contains a garbled legal citation.

Both forms serve the same general purpose — authorizing release of health information — and both remain linked from the website with no guidance on which is current or preferred.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. However, Form 1 does include explicit patient access language: "If you are the patient requesting your own records, you may choose between printed copies or CD." It also includes a "Patient" checkbox among requester roles. Form 2 has a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose but is structurally oriented toward third-party release, requiring the patient to name a "release to" recipient — awkward when requesting one's own records.

The organization does not differentiate individual access from third-party authorization through separate forms, sections, or pathways. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. A general web search for medical records release forms surfaced both PDFs, and a site-specific search confirmed the medical records page. The presence of two overlapping forms with unclear currency creates confusion — a patient finding both would not know which to use. The filename "Auth_ROI_e.pdf" for Form 2 is cryptic and unhelpful. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form is fillable — both require printing and completion by hand. Form 1's image-only format makes it completely inaccessible to assistive technology, likely violating Section 508 and WCAG standards for a government facility. Form 2's text layer is an improvement but copy-protection prevents text selection. Both forms use underscore-line blanks for data entry.

Form 1 packs substantial content onto a single page with cramped layout. Section headings exist but are not strongly differentiated from body text in the scanned format. Form 2 is better organized with clear section headers (USE AND DISCLOSURE, PURPOSE, EXPIRATION, MY RIGHTS, SIGNATURE) and logical flow across two pages, though footnotes descend into dense legal prose.

Language is generally plain in both forms, though both include legal phrasing that may challenge patients with limited health literacy. Neither form provides clear instructions for completion.

## Barriers

- **No electronic submission pathway documented**: Neither form specifies how to submit — no fax number, email address, or portal is mentioned. The forms only address what information to release, not how to submit the request.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate charges.
- **Outdated delivery options**: Form 1 states "Natividad policy is to provide all electronic records on a CD" — CDs are increasingly obsolete, and this may functionally limit patients' right to receive records electronically.
- **SSN collection** (Form 2): Requesting Social Security Number is unnecessary for HIPAA requests and creates identity-theft risk.
- **Blank revocation address** (Form 2): The form instructs patients to submit revocations "to the following address" but leaves the address blank.

## Bright Spots

- Form 1 explicitly addresses patients requesting their own records and offers format choices.
- Form 1's opt-out exclusion model (defaulting to full disclosure with options to exclude HIV, substance abuse, mental health records) is patient-friendly.
- Form 1 dropped the SSN requirement present in Form 2, showing incremental improvement.
- Both forms include patient rights language covering refusal, no-retaliation, revocation, and right to a copy.

## Overall Assessment

Natividad Medical Center provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly maintained patient access experience. The organization relies on generic third-party authorization forms rather than a dedicated patient access pathway. The newer form (2019) is paradoxically less accessible than the older one (2007) due to its image-only scan format — a regression in digital accessibility. Neither form is fillable, no electronic submission method is documented, and the dual-form situation with no guidance creates unnecessary confusion. For a government-owned facility, the accessibility failures are particularly concerning. The org earns a **C grade**, reflecting a process that technically exists but was not designed with patient self-access in mind.

# DHR Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

DHR Health (formerly Doctors Hospital at Renaissance) in Edinburg, TX offers a single pathway for patients requesting their medical records: a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (DSR-GEN-71, dated August 2015), available in both English and Spanish from the Medical Records page. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no online portal, and no digital submission option beyond fax. The form is over a decade old, still carries the organization's former branding, and was designed for third-party release rather than individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents are available on the DHR Health website:

1. **form-1.pdf (English)** — A 2-page authorization form with a text layer and 37 unnamed fillable fields. This is the primary form for any records request.
2. **form-2.pdf (Spanish)** — An image-only scan of the same form, produced on a Konica Minolta copier. No text layer, no functional fillable fields, and several spelling/grammar errors in the Spanish text.

Both serve identical purposes: a bidirectional authorization that can route records either from or to the hospital. The form directs patients to choose between these two directions via an "OR" structure, with no guidance on which section applies to a patient requesting their own records. Submission is by fax or mail to the Health Information Management department; no online portal, email submission, or patient portal pathway was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DHR Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same form is used whether a patient wants copies of their own chart or an attorney is requesting records. There is no streamlined pathway, no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their own records. The form asks patients to state a "purpose" for the request — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access — without clarifying that this field is optional for patients requesting their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is **2 clicks from the homepage** (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and the download links are clearly labeled in English and Spanish. However, legacy URLs from a CMS migration return empty files, meaning patients following older search engine links will get broken downloads. The current URLs use CMS hash paths but have descriptive filenames.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) has a text layer and 37 fillable field annotations, but the fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader and auto-fill functionality. The form is not truly digital-first — it appears to be a designed layout with graphical elements, subsequently exported to PDF with fields added as an afterthought. The Spanish version is materially worse: a flat image-only scan with no text layer, no searchable text, and no assistive technology support, creating a two-tier accessibility gap.

The layout uses a cramped, checkbox-heavy design with multiple columns and 16 embedded images across 2 pages. The language is legalistic but not impenetrable, though the psychiatric/substance abuse/HIV consent section is a particularly dense compound sentence that would confuse most patients. The Do/Do Not consent mechanism via initials is ambiguous in its construction.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Social Security Number required** — The form requests a full SSN with no indication it is optional, creating identity theft risk for a document submitted by fax or mail.
- **Purpose field without exemption** — Patients are asked to justify their request, which HIPAA does not require for individual access.
- **Witness signature line** on the Spanish form adds an unnecessary step.
- **Liability waiver bundled** into the authorization on the Spanish form, asking patients to release the hospital from "all legal liability and any harm" from disclosure.
- **No fee disclosure** — The form says nothing about costs for copies.
- **No expiration clause** on the English form (the Spanish version defaults to 180 days).
- **No patient rights statement** — No reference to the right to access, right to revoke, or right to electronic format.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful in the Rio Grande Valley, where ~90% of the population is Hispanic/Latino. Offering a Spanish form, despite its quality issues, is a genuine accommodation.
- **Granular record type selection** — The ~20-item checkbox list gives patients meaningful control over what they're requesting.
- **Easy website navigation** — The form is prominently placed and easy to find via the main site navigation.

## Overall Assessment

DHR Health provides the bare minimum for patient records access: a downloadable PDF authorization form that is easy to find but poorly designed for patient self-access. The form is a decade-old generic release authorization that does not acknowledge individual access rights, requires unnecessary personal information (SSN), and bundles concerning liability language. The Spanish version's image-only format creates an equity gap. The organization would benefit from a modernized, patient-centered access form — or ideally an online request portal — that separates individual access from third-party release and removes unnecessary barriers.

# Heartland Community Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Heartland Community Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Lawrence, Kansas, serving patients across three locations. The organization provides a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" — for all records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party release.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page PDF titled "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" (form-1.pdf), hosted in the organization's WordPress uploads directory. This form serves all release purposes — patient access, provider-to-provider transfers, insurance disputes, and referrals. A "Patient's Request" checkbox appears among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Records From" and "Records To" fields) is oriented around third-party transfer rather than individual access. A patient requesting records for personal use would find it unclear how to complete the "Records To" section.

Submission options are reasonable: email (medrecords@heartlandhealth.org), fax (785-856-0375), and mail. A phone line for questions (785-842-4477, Option 5) is also provided. These multiple channels meet the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was not discoverable through generic web searches but was found via a site-scoped search (`site:heartlandhealth.org`). The URL is descriptive and the download was straightforward once located. The form is not prominently linked from obvious patient-facing pages — it lives in a WordPress uploads directory, suggesting it may be embedded on an interior page but is not surfaced in primary navigation or a patient resources section.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally-created, single-page PDF with a full text layer — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it functions as a print-and-handwrite document. The layout is logically ordered (demographics → record types → delivery method → from/to → purpose → legal disclosures → signature → return instructions) and fits everything onto a single page, though the density is high with 16 fonts and tight spacing.

The form uses approximately 20+ data entry points (name, DOB, address, phones, date ranges, multiple checkbox groups, records from/to blocks, signature lines). The opening line — "To treat you effectively, your provider needs to review your past medical records" — is patient-friendly, though it subtly frames the form around incoming records transfer rather than patient-initiated access.

One notable design feature is the pre-bundled "Record Set" option, which offers a thoughtfully curated default bundle (last 3 visit notes, recent labs, medication list, immunization records, screening reports, and specialist list). This reduces decision burden for patients who want comprehensive records.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Witness requirement**: A "Witness" signature line is present but never explicitly stated as required. Its inclusion may deter patients or create confusion about whether a witness is actually needed.

**Mental health records**: These require a completely separate form and cannot be combined with other record types on the same submission, creating an additional barrier for patients seeking comprehensive records.

**Email liability disclaimers**: Two separate liability waivers for email delivery appear on the form, which may discourage patients from choosing this convenient option.

**Fees**: No fees are mentioned anywhere on the form — neither disclosed nor waived.

**Compliance language**: The form properly addresses revocation rights, 12-month expiration, treatment non-conditioning, and re-disclosure warnings. However, it does not reference the patient's Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Overall Assessment

Heartland Community Health Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The form is accessible online (with some searching), offers multiple submission channels, and includes some patient-friendly elements like the pre-bundled record set and plain-language opening. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party release framing, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of any dedicated patient access pathway all work against patient-centeredness. The form is adequate for its purpose but was not designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. For an FQHC serving a population that may face literacy or technology barriers, the non-fillable format and dense layout represent meaningful obstacles.

# Northwestern Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Northwestern Memorial Hospital, part of the Northwestern Medicine / Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) system, publishes three documents related to medical records requests. The primary form is **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form 8094, rev. 2/2026) — a system-wide ROI authorization covering all 11 NMHC hospitals, physician groups, and behavioral health locations. **Form-3.pdf** is a full Spanish translation of the same form (8094SP, rev. 8/2024). **Form-2.pdf** is a separate inbound records request form for transferring records *into* NMHC from other providers — not relevant for patient self-access.

All forms are published at the system level on nm.org and are used across all NMHC entities. Northwestern Memorial Hospital does not maintain facility-specific forms.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Northwestern Medicine does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to attorneys, insurers, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" as the purpose, then list themselves as the recipient in the "Send Information To" section. This is functional but unintuitive: the form was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) anywhere on the form. This matters because Right of Access requests carry different fee limits and timing requirements than third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was trivially easy. A basic web search returned direct download links to the PDFs hosted on nm.org's media CDN. No website navigation, login, CAPTCHA, or bot-blocking was encountered. The URLs are descriptive and the forms are well-organized in the patients-and-visitors section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **79 fillable fields** — text inputs, checkboxes, and date fields can all be completed digitally without printing. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → facility selection → purpose → record types → delivery method → medical images → recipient → legal disclosures → signatures. Record-type categories include helpful parenthetical explanations (e.g., "Hospital Stay (History and physical, progress notes, consultations, operative reports, discharge summary, test results)") that help patients understand what they're requesting. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The legal disclosure section is moderately dense but covers required elements: 30-day response window, right to revoke, no care denial for refusal to sign, and sensitive-record opt-outs (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic testing, mental health). The language is somewhat complex but not impenetrably legalistic.

## Submission and Delivery

Submission options are strong: mail (Winfield, IL), fax (312.926.3093), and email (releaseofinformation@nm.org). Delivery options are notably forward-looking: **MyNM patient portal**, fax, email, and US mail (CD or paper). The portal delivery option is a standout feature that removes a common access barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or in-person requirements exist. Fees are referenced vaguely — "Standard record copying fees per 735 ILCS 5/8-2006 may apply" — without specific amounts or clarification that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a cost-based amount. This ambiguity could lead patients to expect the (higher) Illinois statutory copying fees even for personal-use requests.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form** with the same 82 fillable fields — Spanish-speaking patients get equal digital functionality
- **MyNM portal delivery** alongside fax, email, and mail
- **Email submission** (still uncommon among healthcare organizations)
- **Memorable toll-free number**: 877.9RECORD with TTY: 711 support
- **Parenthetical record-type explanations** helping patients understand each category

## Notable Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway — generic authorization form for all release types
- No reference to HIPAA Right of Access or patient access rights
- Fee language references Illinois statute without distinguishing patient-access fee limits
- Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version (missing hospital renaming, updated 42 CFR Part 2 language, and TTY reference)

## Overall Assessment

Northwestern Medicine provides a technically strong, easy-to-find form ecosystem with excellent digital features (fillable fields, email submission, portal delivery, Spanish translation). The primary weakness is structural: the organization channels all records requests — including patient self-access — through a generic authorization form designed for third-party release, without acknowledging the distinct rights and fee limits that apply to individual access under HIPAA. The form works well for patients who know what they need, but it wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# Columbia Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbia Memorial Hospital (CMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Astoria, Oregon. Two ROI forms were found: an English-language "Release of Information" form (HIPAA Form 3B, revised February 2025) and a Spanish translation (HIPAA Form 3Bsp, revised August 2017). Both are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms — the hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access request form distinct from third-party release authorization.

## Access Pathway

CMH funnels all record requests — whether from patients seeking their own records or third parties — through a single generic ROI authorization form. The form's "Purpose" checkboxes (Continuing Care, Insurance, Legal, Other) do not include "Personal use" or "Patient access," forcing a patient requesting their own records to select "Other" and write in a reason. The bidirectional design (Section C has both "Send Records To" and "Request Records From" fields) further signals that this form was designed for inter-facility transfers, not individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The hospital does offer a patient portal (myCMH) for partial record access, but the primary written pathway for requesting complete records is this generic ROI form. There is no evidence of a dedicated patient access request process that distinguishes individual rights from third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page at `columbiamemorial.org/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/` links directly to both the English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative search strategies were needed — basic website navigation sufficed. The page also prominently states that "Records are free to patients who request their records," which is a notable positive signal adjacent to the form links.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a cleanly structured 2-page PDF with five labeled sections (A through E). Page 1 is the patient-facing authorization; page 2 is for hospital administrative use only. The layout is logical and navigable, with clear section headers and a well-organized record-type checklist offering 11 specific categories (Emergency Room, Lab Reports, Imaging, etc.) each with a date-of-service field.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). All data entry relies on printed blank lines, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the PDF was clearly created in a layout tool capable of adding interactive fields.

The language is generally plain and accessible. The opening purpose statement ("This form is an authorization to release protected health information") is clear and direct. The signature block language is standard without excessive legalese. There are no instructions or guidance text beyond the section labels, and no statement of patient rights beyond the required notice about entitlement to a copy of the signed authorization.

Submission methods are not explicitly stated on the form itself, though the header lists both a phone number and fax number. The page 2 hospital-use section tracks delivery via "Pt. Pick-Up," "Mailed," "Faxed," and "Electronic" — but these are staff-facing fields, not patient-facing options. A patient filling out the form independently would have to infer that faxing is acceptable.

## Barriers and Compliance

CMH demonstrates several positive practices: no notarization or witness requirement, no in-person mandate, and an explicit commitment to free records for patient access (stated on the website, though not on the form itself). Processing time is stated as 72–96 business hours.

The primary compliance concern is the absence of explicit expiration date/event language and revocation instructions in the form text — elements required by HIPAA § 164.508(c)(1)(v) for valid authorizations. Additionally, the form includes no reference to patient rights under HIPAA, no information about fees on the form itself, and no delivery format options for the patient.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Bilingual form availability (English and Spanish) is uncommon, especially for a small rural critical access hospital, and demonstrates attention to community language needs. The explicit "records are free" statement is exemplary transparency. The well-organized section structure makes the form more navigable than many single-block authorization forms.

**Red flags:** The Spanish form is nearly 8 years older than the English version (2017 vs. 2025), creating a risk that Spanish-speaking patients encounter outdated language or missing sections. Page 2 of the Spanish form is entirely untranslated. The form's missing expiration/revocation language may render signed authorizations technically non-compliant.

## Overall Assessment

Columbia Memorial Hospital provides a reasonably accessible, well-organized ROI process with commendable bilingual availability and fee transparency. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and gaps in compliance language prevent it from achieving the highest marks. A patient can get their records here without unreasonable barriers, but the process was not designed with the individual access use case as a priority.

# Black River Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Black River Memorial Hospital (Black River Falls, WI) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital operating under the "Black River Health" brand. The organization offers a single downloadable ROI form for patients requesting health records. There is no patient portal–based request pathway, no online submission wizard, and no dedicated patient access form — only a general-purpose "Release of Information Authorization" that serves all release scenarios.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one ROI-related form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page "Release of Information Authorization" linked from the Patient Resources page. The form covers both directions of information flow — releasing records from the organization and receiving records to it — and is designed primarily for facility-to-facility transfers. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this general-purpose form, selecting "Per Patient Request" as one of eight possible reasons for the release.

No online portal, email submission, or electronic request pathway exists. The form lists delivery format options for *receiving* records (Mailed, Faxed, Pick Up, CD) but provides **no instructions for how to submit the completed form** — no mailing address, fax number, or drop-off location. The only contact information on the form is the HIPAA Privacy & Security Officer phone number (715-284-5361). A patient would need to call to determine how to return the form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. It is linked from the Patient Resources page under a "Forms" section, labeled "Authorization to Disclose Information." A site-specific web search also surfaced the direct PDF URL immediately. The description on the website frames the form as being for sharing information "from other healthcare facilities or providers" — not explicitly for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Black River Memorial Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form funnels all requests through the same authorization workflow. While the form includes "Per Patient Request" as a reason option and page 2 contains a substantive patient rights section (right to receive a copy, refuse to sign, revoke, inspect, and prohibition of conditions), the form's structure assumes a third-party release scenario: Section 2 asks "who has the information" and Section 3 asks "where you want it sent." A patient requesting their own records must work within this framework, which isn't designed for them.

## Form Document Quality

The form has **severe technical accessibility problems**. Despite being created in Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 in 2025, the PDF renders virtually all text as images — 970 embedded images across 2 pages, with only 43 characters of extractable text. The form has zero fillable/interactive fields; patients must print and complete it by hand. This makes the form inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.

On the positive side, the visual layout is well-organized with numbered sections and clear headers using question-like phrasing ("Why the information is needed," "How would you like this information"). The form is a reasonable 2 pages in length. However, Section 2 confusingly mixes source facility checkboxes with information-type checkboxes (Alcohol Treatment, HIV Results), and Section 5 imposes a default 2-year scope if the patient doesn't specify a date range.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. The form mentions a "reasonable fee may be associated" for inspecting or copying records but provides no specifics on amounts or HIPAA fee limitations. No response time commitment is stated. The prohibition of conditions language is explicitly included — the organization cannot condition treatment or benefits on signing the authorization. A photocopy clause ("as valid as the original") is a patient-friendly touch.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Easy findability, explicit prohibition of conditions, photocopy validity clause, patient-friendly expiration (remains in effect until processed), and direct HIPAA Privacy Officer contact information.

**Red flags:** The near-total text inaccessibility of a modern Word-generated PDF is a significant barrier, particularly for patients with disabilities. The complete absence of submission instructions means a patient who downloads the form online has no idea how to return it. The lack of any dedicated patient access pathway means every patient must navigate a form designed for third-party releases.

## Overall Assessment

Black River Memorial Hospital provides an easy-to-find form with reasonable content and good compliance language, but the technical execution is poor and the patient access experience is an afterthought. The image-rendered PDF and missing submission instructions create unnecessary friction for a patient trying to exercise their right of access. **Grade: C.**

# Lexington Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Lexington Medical Center (West Columbia, SC) publishes three documents on its Medical Records page at lexhealth.com/medical-records: an English-language "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (form-1), a full Spanish translation of the same form (form-2), and a supplemental Reproductive Health Attestation form (form-3) implementing the 2024 HIPAA privacy rule. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a two-page general-purpose ROI authorization. The website also mentions MyChart as a digital option for records requests, though that portal-based pathway was not directly evaluated.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lexington Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic authorization: "I authorize the following provider/entity _____ to release my health information to: Recipient/Provider Name: _____." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly designate themselves as both the authorizer and the recipient — an unintuitive workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no separate patient access form, and no language explaining that patients have a legal right to obtain their own records. The form funnels all requests — whether to insurers, attorneys, family members, or the patient themselves — through the same third-party release authorization framework.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which links directly to all three PDFs. No bot blocking, no JavaScript rendering issues, and no portal login was required. The Medical Records page provides context for both digital (MyChart) and paper-based requests. This is a well-organized web presence for records access information.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a digitally-authored, text-based PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores and all checkboxes are non-interactive symbol characters. Patients must print and complete the form by hand. The layout is well-organized into three clear sections: patient identification and routing, medical records release details with a granular record-type checklist (~25 categories), and review/authorization terms with a signature block. At two pages, the length is appropriate. Language is moderately formal — not impenetrable legalese, but not plain language either. The authorization conditions (Section 3) use standard legal register that most adults could follow with careful reading.

Submission is limited on the form itself: the only method stated is postal mail ("Mail completed form to: Lexington Health Attn: Medical Records, 2720 Sunset Blvd."). However, Condition 6 states that "a copy or fax of this document is just as valid as the original document," implying fax submission would be accepted, though no fax number is provided for the records department. The website separately references MyChart for digital requests.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness signature** is required — a welcome absence. The form also explicitly accepts copies and faxes as valid. However, there are notable concerns:

- **Full SSN collection**: The form requests the patient's complete Social Security Number as a top-level identifier, which is unnecessary for HIPAA purposes and creates identity theft risk on a document designed to be mailed.
- **Blanket substance abuse/psychiatric disclosure**: Condition 1 states that alcohol abuse, psychiatric, drug abuse, and communicable disease records "will be released" with no opt-out, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records.
- **Undisclosed fees**: Patients are told "there may be a charge" and must call (803) 791-2264 to learn the amount — no upfront fee transparency.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires in 90 days, which is short but generally adequate for a single records request.

## Notable Strengths

The **Spanish-language version** (form-2) is a full professional translation co-located with the English form — not buried in a separate section. It uniquely includes an interpreter services phone number with conference call instructions, a thoughtful accessibility touch. The **granular record-type checklist** gives patients meaningful control over what gets released. The **Reproductive Health Attestation** (form-3) demonstrates proactive compliance with recent HIPAA regulatory changes, ahead of many peer organizations.

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Medical Center makes its forms easy to find and offers a well-organized, bilingual paper-based workflow. However, the process fundamentally treats patient self-access as indistinguishable from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a generic authorization form not designed for their needs. The non-fillable PDF and mail-only submission (on the form itself) create unnecessary friction in an era of digital health records. The SSN collection and blanket substance abuse disclosure represent compliance concerns. The organization earns credit for findability, bilingual access, and clear layout, but falls short on patient-centeredness and technical accessibility.

# Flowers Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Flowers Hospital in Dothan, Alabama, is a 235-bed for-profit community hospital owned by Triad of Alabama LLC and operating within the Community Health Systems (CHS) network. Three documents were retrieved: the hospital's official "Patient Request for Health Information" form (HIM-1406) in both English (form-2.pdf) and Spanish (form-3.pdf), plus an incidental release form from Wiregrass Surgical Associates, an affiliated practice housed at the hospital's Doctor's Center (form-1.pdf). The primary form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, the English HIM-1406.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated and Patient-Centered

Flowers Hospital provides a genuinely patient-centered access pathway. The official form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" — not "Authorization for Release" or "HIPAA Disclosure Form" — framing the interaction around the patient's own right of access. The form's recipient section lists "Myself" as the first option, with "Personal Representative" and "Other Third Party" as secondary choices. This clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release within a single, well-structured document.

Beyond the PDF, the hospital's medical records page offers an online request portal via Swellbox, providing a fully digital submission alternative. Between the fillable PDF (submittable via fax or mail) and the Swellbox portal, patients have multiple electronic submission options — no in-person visit or postal mail is required.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's website has a "Request Medical Records" page accessible from the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation. That page links directly to both the English and Spanish PDF forms and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative searching was needed. This is a model of how a hospital should surface its records request process.

## Form Document Quality

The HIM-1406 form is a single-page, digitally-designed PDF created in Adobe InDesign with 66 fillable AcroForm fields — an impressive level of interactivity for a one-page form. Every text input, checkbox, and selection area is digitally fillable, allowing patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing.

The form follows a logical seven-section flow: patient demographics, facility identification, record type selection (13 checkboxes including "Entire Record"), sensitive information opt-in (5 categories covering substance abuse, HIV, genetics, and psychiatric records), delivery method, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and accessible throughout. Five delivery methods are offered: paper, email (with appropriate risk disclosure), removable media (with password-protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media option with a password-protection toggle is an unusually thoughtful feature.

The Spanish version (HIM-1406S) is a complete, professional translation with identical structure and field count, linked co-equally alongside the English form — not a machine-generated afterthought.

## Barriers and Concerns

No significant barriers exist. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, and no excessive fee schedule. The form does include a witness signature field whose status as required or optional is ambiguous — this could deter patients completing the form at home. The fee disclosure is vague ("There may be charges associated with processing a request"), giving patients no way to estimate costs upfront. While not affirmatively problematic, greater fee transparency would better serve patients.

The form begins with an unexplained "*ROI*" header (internal jargon for "Release of Information") and the fillable fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader accessibility. The footer on the Spanish form remains in English — a minor inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

Flowers Hospital represents a strong example of patient-centered records access. The dedicated patient access form with "Myself" as the primary option, the comprehensive fillable PDF, the co-equal Spanish translation, the Swellbox portal alternative, and the easy findability from the main website all demonstrate genuine attention to the patient experience. The minor issues — ambiguous witness field, vague fee language, accessibility gaps — prevent a perfect score but do not materially impede a patient requesting their own records. This organization earns a grade of **A**.

# Southeast Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Southeast Medical Group (SEMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Alpharetta, Georgia. SEMG does not publish its own standalone Release of Information form. Instead, it outsources the entire records-request process to **MediCopy**, a third-party health information management vendor. Four documents were retrieved during the evaluation: two versions of MediCopy's generic ROI authorization form (2023 and 2020), an SEMG patient portal proxy authorization form, and SEMG's multi-page patient registration packet. Only the MediCopy authorization forms are relevant to a patient requesting their own records.

## Pathways Available

The patient journey for requesting records begins at SEMG's website. The Resources section includes a "Medical Records" area with a "Request Records" link, which redirects through `semg.link/med-records` to **medicopy.net/patients** — a third-party site with no SEMG branding. From there, patients can either download a PDF authorization form or use MediCopy's HelloSign-based online authorization wizard. SEMG's FAQ also provides an email address (medicalrecords@southeastmedicalgroup.com) as a contact point for records requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SEMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The MediCopy authorization form is a generic instrument that treats every request identically — whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney is requesting them. "Personal Use" is listed among five purpose-of-disclosure options, but there is no separate pathway, form, or instructions for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The form asks patients to fill in both a source facility and a recipient, requiring a self-requesting patient to effectively provide their own contact information twice. No mention is made of patient-specific rights, fee limits, or the distinct legal framework that applies to individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. Direct searches for SEMG-specific ROI forms on the SEMG website and via Google yielded nothing — the forms page lists 10 patient forms but no ROI authorization. The FAQ answer for "How can I get a copy of my medical record?" is helpful, providing a direct link to MediCopy and an email address. However, a patient who bypasses the FAQ and navigates to the forms page would find no relevant document. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during retrieval. The redirect chain to a third-party site introduces an element of confusion — a patient clicking "Request Records" lands on a MediCopy page with no mention of SEMG.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (MediCopy 2023 authorization, form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. Despite being digitally authored, it has **zero fillable form fields** — patients must print and handwrite all information. The layout is well-organized, following a logical top-down flow: source facility → patient demographics → recipient → record types → purpose → delivery method → signature. Section headers use plain, conversational language ("Tell us about the patient," "How would you like the records sent?"), which is notably more approachable than typical ROI forms. The authorization paragraph is a single block of standard legal text covering validity, revocation, re-disclosure, and no-conditioning — dense but not unreasonably so.

The form offers good granularity for record-type selection (11 options including date ranges and "Other") and an opt-out exclusion model for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/STDs, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postal mail.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and creates unnecessary identity theft risk. **No submission instructions**: The form itself contains no address, fax number, email, or portal link for returning the completed authorization — a patient who downloads the PDF in isolation has no way to know where to send it. **Fee opacity**: The form notes "additional fee applies" for postal delivery but provides no dollar amounts for any delivery method. More concerning, SEMG's registration packet (form-4) discloses an Administrative Service Fee structure of $10–$150 per form, with "immunization records" listed as an example — this broad language could encompass patient access requests and would likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based fee limits.

## Notable Strengths

The plain-language section headers and sensitive-record exclusion options are genuine bright spots in form design. MediCopy's availability of an online HelloSign authorization provides a fully digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF. The FAQ's direct answer about records requests, including both a link and an email address, is more helpful than many practices' web presences. SEMG's registration form also includes modern patient-centered fields for preferred language and pronouns.

## Overall Assessment

SEMG provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records requests. The outsourcing to MediCopy means patients interact with a generic vendor form that was not designed around patient self-access. The form's content design is above average thanks to plain language and logical organization, but technical limitations (non-fillable PDF, missing submission instructions) and compliance gaps (SSN collection, fee ambiguity) weigh it down. The organization earns a middling assessment: records are obtainable, but the process was clearly not designed with the individual patient in mind.

# Hartford Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hartford Hospital is part of Hartford HealthCare (HHC), a regional nonprofit health system in Connecticut. For medical records requests, the organization uses the system-wide "Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information" form (HH Forms 571559, Rev. 11-2022), a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all 11 HHC facilities. Three PDF documents were retrieved: the system-wide form hosted on two different HHC domains (form-1 and form-3, which are textually identical), and an older Institute of Living–specific variant from 2012 (form-2). The primary form for a patient seeking their own records is form-1.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Route

Hartford Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The system-wide form is a general-purpose authorization designed equally for third-party release (to insurers, attorneys, other providers) and patient self-access. The form's structure — "I authorize _____ to disclose/obtain health information to: ______" — is fundamentally oriented around third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must puzzle over which blank to fill with the hospital's name and which with their own.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient" as one checkbox alongside "Medical," "Legal," "Disability," and "Insurance," correctly marked as "(Optional)." But the form offers no simplified pathway, no separate section, and no explanatory text for patients exercising their Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524. The patient must navigate the same form and fields designed for attorneys and insurance companies.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The parent system's medical records page at `hartfordhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/patients/medical-records` is well-organized and links directly to the authorization form. However, a patient starting at `hartfordhospital.org` must navigate to the parent system's site. A previously indexed URL for the form now returns a 404 error, meaning patients following older search results or bookmarks encounter a dead link. The current URL uses an opaque numeric filename (`571559.pdf`) that gives no indication of the document's contents.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised in November 2022, every field is rendered as static underscored blank lines. A patient must print the form and complete it by hand — or use a PDF annotation tool as a workaround. For a major regional health system, the absence of any interactive form fields is a significant missed opportunity.

The layout is dense but logically organized: patient identification → source/destination → delivery method → record types → purpose → rights/signature. However, the form opens with staff-facing administrative fields (MR#, Date Completed, Pages Copied, Initials) that have no relevance to patients and may cause confusion. The record type section offers 19 checkbox options — useful granularity for specificity but potentially overwhelming for patients who simply want "my records." Sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse, reproductive health) are appropriately broken out with corresponding legal notices on page 2.

The language is moderately legalistic. The opening sentence is a dense multi-clause construction that packs in references to mental illness, substance abuse, HIV, and reproductive services. Page 2's legal notices contain typographical errors ("If the event" instead of "In the event") and inconsistent capitalization.

## Submission Methods and Barriers

The form lists fax numbers and mailing addresses for all 11 HHC facilities, making submission by fax or mail straightforward. There is no email address, web portal, or online submission option. Fax qualifies as an adequate electronic pathway per our scoring baseline.

**No notarization or witness is required.** No fees are mentioned on the form. The form correctly states that treatment is not conditioned on signing the authorization, and that the patient may inspect or copy their information. The purpose field is correctly marked optional.

## Bright Spots

- **Comprehensive facility directory**: All 11 HHC facilities listed with addresses and fax numbers as checkboxes, eliminating the common pain point of not knowing where to send the form.
- **Connecticut-specific protections**: Detailed legal notice blocks for HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, and reproductive health records, citing applicable state and federal law.
- **Purpose marked optional**: Correctly implements the HIPAA principle that patients need not justify access requests.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Separate checkboxes for specially protected categories give patients granular control.

## Red Flags

- **Stale URL returning 404**: Older links to the form lead to a dead end.
- **Confusing dual-purpose "disclose/obtain" structure**: Patients must determine which direction of information flow applies to them.
- **"Electronic" delivery undefined**: Listed as an option with no explanation of what it means in practice.
- **Typographical errors**: Multiple instances of "If the event" instead of "In the event" on page 2.

## Overall Assessment

Hartford Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request experience. The system-wide form covers the basics and includes appropriate compliance language, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and generic third-party authorization structure all represent missed opportunities to serve patients well. The form is a C-grade experience: a patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them in mind.
