# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 15 Findings

## Classification Summary

Across 190 organizations with synthesis data, the dominant pattern is clear: most organizations funnel patients requesting their own records through a form designed for third-party release.

| Pathway | Count | % |
|---|---:|---:|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 132 | 69% |
| Dedicated patient access form (with separate third-party form) | 21 | 11% |
| Online portal (no downloadable form) | 19 | 10% |
| Generic form with some self-access signal | 10 | 5% |
| Phone/in-person only | 7 | 4% |
| Dedicated patient access form only | 1 | <1% |

Only **22 organizations (12%)** provide a dedicated patient access form aligned with HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524. The remaining **142 organizations (75%)** using downloadable forms offer only a generic HIPAA authorization — and of those, just 10 make any meaningful attempt to accommodate self-access within that generic structure.

## What Makes a Generic Form a Poor Fit

A patient requesting their own records through a third-party authorization form encounters several concrete problems:

**Wrong framing.** The form asks who records should be "released to," forcing patients to write their own name as the recipient. At Abbeville Area Medical Center, the patient must list themselves under "Name/Facility" in a field designed for external organizations. At Columbus Community Hospital, patients must write their own name as the recipient "with no guidance that this is a valid use case." The entire document frames the transaction as *authorizing disclosure to someone else*, not exercising a personal right.

**Unnecessary fields.** Generic forms require a recipient name, address, and relationship — meaningless for self-access. Several organizations collect Social Security Numbers (Addabbo Family Health Center, Guthrie Corning Hospital), adding privacy risk to a transaction that shouldn't require them. Purpose-of-disclosure checkboxes designed for insurance or legal requests force patients to hunt for an applicable option like "Personal" buried among "Litigation," "Insurance," and "Continuing Care."

**Burdensome requirements imported from the authorization context.** At Duly Health and Care, the form demands a witness signature for "Personal Reasons" requests and categorically rejects requests for "all records" — a requirement that may violate the Right of Access. Across the 132 generic-only organizations, 19 (14%) require a witness or notarized signature, a requirement HIPAA does not impose for patient access requests.

**Missing rights information.** Generic forms virtually never mention the 30-day response deadline, HIPAA fee limits for patient access, or the patient's right to receive records in their requested format (including electronically). At Grady Memorial Hospital, there is "no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access." The misleading authorization framing can even suggest the organization has more discretion to deny the request than it actually does — NewYork-Presbyterian's form states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records," which is accurate for third-party releases but misleading for patient self-access.

## What Good Looks Like

The 22 organizations with dedicated forms demonstrate clear alternatives:

**Intermountain Medical Center** separates patient self-access from third-party release into two distinct forms. The patient form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information," uses question-based headings ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?"), and defaults to "Self" as the first delivery option. The footer acknowledges the patient's right of access under HIPAA.

**Barnes-Jewish Hospital** maintains a Medical Records page that explicitly categorizes "Individual requests" separately from "Third-party requests." The patient access form uses right-of-access framing — "requesting access" rather than "authorizing release" — the correct legal framing under § 164.524.

**Ben Taub Hospital** (Harris Health) demonstrates a hybrid approach within a single form: sections for purpose-of-request and expiration are explicitly marked "only required if the individual providing this authorization form is someone other than the patient," and email delivery is labeled "Patients Only."

## Patterns

The wrong-form problem is pervasive across all facility types and regions. No category of organization is immune: teaching hospitals (Yale New Haven, Duke), community hospitals (Lane County, Columbus Community), FQHCs (Addabbo, El Centro de Corazón), and large physician practices (GI Alliance, ENT & Allergy Associates) all default to generic authorization forms. System affiliation does not reliably help — some systems like Intermountain and BJC/Washington University differentiate, while HCA, SSM Health, and Avera use system-wide generic forms across all affiliates.

The 10% of organizations offering portal-only pathways sidestep the form problem entirely but create their own barriers (vendor lock-in, account requirements, limited record types).
