# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 22 Analysis

## Summary

Of 190 organizations with available data in this batch, **142 (75%)** offer only a generic HIPAA authorization form for patients seeking their own medical records. Just 22 orgs (12%) provide a dedicated patient access form alongside a generic authorization ("BOTH"), and only 1 org offers a dedicated form exclusively. Another 19 orgs use portal-only or portal-primary pathways, and 7 offer no downloadable form at all.

## Classification Tally

| Pathway Classification | Count | % of 190 |
|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 142 | 75% |
| Both dedicated + generic forms | 22 | 12% |
| Portal-only (no PDF form) | 8 | 4% |
| Portal + dedicated form | 6 | 3% |
| Portal + generic form | 5 | 3% |
| No form (phone/in-person only) | 7 | 4% |
| Dedicated form only | 1 | <1% |

## What Makes Generic Forms a Poor Fit

The 142 generic-only organizations force patients requesting their *own* records into a workflow designed for third-party disclosures — sending records to an attorney, insurer, or another provider. This creates several concrete problems:

**Wrong framing.** Generic forms ask patients to fill in "Release FROM [provider] TO [recipient]," requiring patients to awkwardly write their own name as the recipient. At Cordova Community Medical Center, patients must "write their own name as recipient" in a field designed for external parties. The entire form narrative — "I authorize X to disclose my records to Y" — frames the patient as granting permission to share *outward*, not exercising a *right* to access.

**Unnecessary fields.** HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) does not require patients to state a purpose for accessing their own records. Yet generic forms routinely demand one. At Desert Regional Medical Center, patients must select a purpose from a list oriented toward third-party use cases. JPS Health Network's form similarly requires purpose justification. Barrett Hospital's form even includes conditioning language — "refusal to sign may affect ability to obtain treatment or payment" — language that belongs on a consent form, not an access request.

**Witness and notarization barriers.** Among the 142 generic-only orgs, **19 (13%)** require or imply a witness or notarized signature — a requirement HIPAA does not impose for patient access. Millinocket Regional Hospital's form mandates "all spaces on this form MUST be completed," which combined with a witness line effectively requires one. Troy Regional Medical Center bundles a liability waiver — patients must "discharge facility from all liabilities" — as a condition of signing.

**Fee confusion.** Generic forms often cite fee schedules that fail to distinguish patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based charges) from third-party release fees (which can be higher). JPS Health Network charges a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery and $30 for the first 10 pages. Saratoga Hospital lists $0.75/page without any distinction.

**SSN collection.** Several generic forms request Social Security Numbers — Rio Grande Hospital and DHR Health both collect SSNs with no indication this is optional, creating unnecessary identity theft risk for a simple records request.

## Patient Experience Impact

The patient-centeredness scores tell the story clearly. Generic-only orgs average a patient-centeredness score of **2.89** out of 5, versus **3.52** for organizations with dedicated forms, portals, or both. Among generic-only orgs, 22 scored at the lowest level (2/5), where "patient self-access is an afterthought."

A patient at one of these 142 organizations would typically: (1) find a form titled "Authorization to Release/Disclose Protected Health Information," (2) encounter fields asking who should *receive* their records as if they're a third party, (3) be asked to justify *why* they want their own records, (4) potentially need a witness signature to complete the form at home, and (5) see fee language that doesn't distinguish their federally protected right from a commercial records release.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Critical access hospitals are the worst offenders: **93%** (27/29) offer only a generic form, likely reflecting limited administrative resources to create purpose-specific documents. Regional systems also trend high at **86%** (31/36), often deploying a single system-wide authorization form across all affiliates. Community hospitals fare relatively better at **66%** (53/80), with more organizations offering dedicated patient pathways or portal alternatives. Major health systems show the most differentiation at **65%** generic-only (42/65), consistent with having the resources to develop separate patient access workflows.

## Notable Positive Examples

Organizations that *do* differentiate demonstrate what good looks like. Providence Sacred Heart and Providence St. Vincent offer separate patient access forms alongside generic authorizations. Intermountain Medical Center, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and Huntington Hospital (Northwell) all maintain distinct pathways for patient self-access versus third-party release. These forms typically use plain language ("Request Your Medical Records"), omit purpose requirements, and cite the patient's right of access.

## Conclusion

Three-quarters of organizations in this batch funnel patient self-access requests through a form designed for a fundamentally different purpose. The result is not merely inconvenient — it applies inapplicable legal requirements (purpose statements, witness signatures, third-party fee schedules) to what should be the simplest interaction in healthcare information access: a patient asking for their own records.
