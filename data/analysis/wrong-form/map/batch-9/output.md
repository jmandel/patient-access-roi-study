# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 9 Findings

## Classification Summary

Across the 190 organizations with scored data, the access pathway classification breaks down as follows:

| Pathway Type | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 132 | 69% |
| Generic with partial self-access signal | 10 | 5% |
| Both (dedicated + generic forms) | 21 | 11% |
| Dedicated patient access form only | 1 | 1% |
| Online portal | 19 | 10% |
| No online form / phone only | 7 | 4% |

**Three-quarters of organizations (142/190)** route patients through a generic third-party authorization form when the patient is simply trying to exercise their Right of Access under § 164.524. Only 22 organizations (12%) offer any dedicated patient access form, and just one (Wayne County Hospital) uses a dedicated form exclusively.

## What Makes Generic Forms a Poor Fit

The twelve organizations examined in detail reveal a consistent set of problems when generic authorization forms are repurposed for patient self-access:

**Self-as-recipient confusion.** Generic forms ask patients to specify a recipient entity for their records. At UCSF Medical Center, the patient must fill in both the "I authorize [source]" and "to release health information to [recipient]" fields — effectively authorizing the release of their own records *to themselves*. At Fallon Medical Complex in rural Montana, the patient navigates "Release From" / "Release To" fields designed for inter-organizational transfers, with no guidance on how to complete them for a self-access request. Community Health Centers of Burlington presents "Information REQUESTED FROM" and "Information RELEASED TO" blocks oriented toward third-party release, requiring the patient to figure out where to put their own name.

**Unnecessary barriers imposed uniformly.** Because the generic form treats all requesters identically, barriers designed for third-party disclosures fall on patients too. Duly Health and Care requires a **witness signature** for patients requesting records for "Personal Reasons" — an unusual burden with no HIPAA basis. Desert Valley Hospital collects a full **Social Security Number** and warns that incomplete forms "may invalidate this Authorization," pressuring patients to provide unnecessary personal data. These requirements make sense (if at all) for third-party releases but are inappropriate for patient self-access.

**Wrong legal framing.** The authorization paradigm treats the patient as someone *granting permission* for disclosure rather than *exercising a right*. Lincoln Hospital's form has a dual structure where the third-party authorization fields dominate page 1, with patient access buried as an "ACCESS REQUEST" section on page 2. The patient receives no clear guidance on which parts apply to them. Duly Health and Care's form makes no acknowledgment that HIPAA limits fees for patient access requests or requires a 30-day response — rights that exist regardless of the form used.

**Fee opacity.** Generic forms rarely disclose fee structures. Duly states only that "Charges may apply. Please contact us for details. Cash payments are not accepted." UCSF discloses fees on its website ($0.25/page paper, $25 electronic) but not on the form. The absence of fee information on generic forms means patients cannot assess whether charges comply with HIPAA's cost-based limits for individual access.

## What Good Looks Like

The contrast with organizations offering dedicated patient access forms is stark. **Mercy General Hospital** (Dignity Health/CommonSpirit) maintains separate "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" forms explicitly stating they will not result in disclosure to anyone other than the patient. **AdventHealth Central Texas** offers a facility-specific form with "Provide me with access to the protected health information specified below" as its first checkbox option — a clear patient-centered pathway distinct from third-party disclosure. **Wayne County Hospital**, a 25-bed critical access hospital in Kentucky, titles its form "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" and addresses the patient as the expected user, proving that even small rural facilities can get this right.

The patient-centeredness score gap is measurable: organizations with dedicated patient access forms average **4.36/5** on patient-centeredness, versus **2.89/5** for generic-only organizations — a 1.5-point difference on a 5-point scale.

## Patterns

The generic-only problem spans all organization types and regions. It affects academic medical centers (UCSF), large physician practices (Duly Health and Care), critical access hospitals (Pocahontas Memorial, Fallon Medical Complex), and community hospitals (Desert Valley Hospital) alike. Baptist Health Lexington represents a middle ground — its generic form includes a "Myself" checkbox and notes that purpose of release is "not required if being disclosed directly to patient," a partial accommodation that still falls short of a dedicated pathway.

Portal-based organizations (10% of the sample) sidestep the form problem entirely, though they introduce different access barriers (account creation, vendor lock-in). The Iowa Clinic has fully transitioned to online platforms, abandoning PDF forms altogether.

## Conclusion

The wrong-form problem is systemic and widespread. Seven in ten organizations studied treat a patient requesting their own records identically to a lawyer or insurance company requesting them — same form, same fields, same barriers. This reflects a fundamental institutional confusion between HIPAA § 164.508 (authorization for third-party disclosure) and § 164.524 (individual right of access). The patient's right of access requires no authorization; the patient is exercising a right, not granting permission. Yet the dominant workflow forces them into an authorization paradigm that creates confusion, collects irrelevant information, and obscures the rights HIPAA guarantees.
