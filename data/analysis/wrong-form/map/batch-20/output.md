# The Wrong Form Problem — Batch 20 Analysis

## Classification Summary

Of 190 organizations with available data (5 missing), we classified each org's primary access pathway for patients requesting their **own** records:

| Pathway | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 142 | 75% |
| Both dedicated + generic forms | 21 | 11% |
| Portal-only (online wizard) | 19 | 10% |
| No form / phone-only | 7 | 4% |
| Dedicated patient form only | 1 | 1% |

**The headline finding: three out of four organizations offer patients only a generic third-party authorization form when those patients want to exercise their individual Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524.** Among the 164 orgs that provide a downloadable PDF form, 87% offer only the generic version.

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit?

The generic HIPAA authorization form was designed for a fundamentally different transaction — authorizing one entity to release records *to another party* (an insurer, attorney, another provider). When a patient uses this form to request their own records, several mismatches emerge:

**1. Wrong conceptual frame.** The patient must authorize "release" of records *to themselves*, filling in their own name and address in the "recipient" field. At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a patient must select "Personal Use" as the purpose, then list themselves as the recipient in the "Send Information To" section — a form structure that assumes the requester and recipient are different people. At Cherokee Health Systems (now River Valley Health), the bidirectional form has "Record Requested to be Sent From" and "Record to be Sent To" facility sections, forcing the patient to "awkwardly fit themselves into the 'Record to be Sent To' facility section."

**2. Irrelevant fields and cognitive burden.** SSM Health's dual-purpose form requires patients to navigate a "disclose my protected health information to" block with name, address, fax, and relationship fields — all designed for third-party disclosure. A patient must figure out which fields to fill, which to skip, and how to route a form that assumes a releasing-from and releasing-to party. The "For personal access" checkbox is buried under "Purpose of Disclosure" alongside "Insurance/Workers' Compensation" and "Legal."

**3. No mention of patient rights.** Generic forms almost never reference HIPAA's Right of Access, the 30-day response requirement, or the cost-based fee limit that applies specifically to patient self-access. At UCSF Medical Center, the authorization form "makes no distinction between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party requesting records." This matters financially: Right of Access requests carry different (lower) fee limits than third-party authorizations, but patients using the wrong form have no way to know this.

**4. Confusing legal framing.** Guthrie Corning Hospital's form uses language like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" — distancing third-person framing that reads as if someone else is making the request. The form "does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508."

## What Does Good Look Like?

The 22 organizations with dedicated patient forms demonstrate the contrast. Northwell Health provides a separate "Request for Access to Health Information" form explicitly citing HIPAA § 164.524, distinct from their third-party "Authorization for Release" form. Advocate Health offers a "Patient Request for Health Information" form with a prominent callout to patient portal access. Providence has a "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — the legal term that signals this form knows what it's for. These dedicated forms don't ask the patient to name a "recipient" because the patient *is* the recipient.

## Patterns by Organization Type

The generic-only problem is pervasive across all categories. Among the 142 generic-only orgs: community hospitals (53), critical access hospitals (27), teaching hospitals (24), physician practices (21), and FQHCs (17). Independent organizations (69) are slightly more likely to be generic-only than major-system affiliates (42), but even large academic systems like Northwestern Medicine, UCSF, and UW Medicine channel patient self-access through generic authorization forms. The South (48) and Midwest (35) have the most generic-only orgs, but no region is spared.

## Patient Impact

A patient approaching any of these 142 organizations encounters a form that was not designed for them. They must decode which fields apply, skip irrelevant recipient sections, locate a "personal use" checkbox among options meant for insurers and attorneys, and sign a document that frames their fundamental right as a discretionary authorization. They receive no information about response timelines, fee limits, or their right to appeal a denial. The form communicates, implicitly but unmistakably: *this process was built for someone else, and you're borrowing it.*
