# The Wrong Form Problem: Batch 12 Analysis

## Classification Summary

Across 190 organizations with scored synthesis data, the access pathway breakdown is:

| Category | Count | % | Avg Patient-Centeredness |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generic HIPAA authorization only | 132 | 69% | 2.8 / 5 |
| Both dedicated + generic forms | 28 | 15% | 4.2 / 5 |
| Online portal only | 19 | 10% | 3.3 / 5 |
| No online pathway | 7 | 4% | 1.4 / 5 |
| Generic with partial differentiation | 3 | 2% | 3.3 / 5 |
| Dedicated patient access form only | 1 | <1% | 4.0 / 5 |

**The core finding: 69% of organizations offer patients only a generic third-party authorization form** — designed for releasing records *to someone else* — when a patient wants to request their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524). Only 1 organization (Wayne County Hospital) provides a dedicated patient access form without also bundling a generic authorization. Another 28 orgs offer both form types, nearly always through a parent health system.

## System Affiliation Is the Strongest Predictor

Organizations offering both form types are overwhelmingly system-affiliated: 21 of 28 belong to major systems (Advocate Health, Ascension, SSM Health, CommonSpirit, etc.) versus only 5 independents. By contrast, generic-only orgs split evenly: 66 independent, 35 major system, 31 regional. **Large health systems are the primary source of dedicated patient access forms**, likely because system-level HIM departments have the resources and regulatory sophistication to create purpose-built workflows. Critical access hospitals and FQHCs — the smallest, most resource-constrained facilities — are almost entirely generic-only (25 of 26 CAHs, 16 of 18 FQHCs with forms).

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

The two batch-identified organizations illustrate the mismatch clearly:

**Community Health Center of Central Missouri** (FQHC, generic-only) uses a single "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" with a FROM/TO routing structure: "Please send my records FROM… TO…" A patient requesting their own records must write their own name and address in the "TO" field — a field designed for external recipients like insurers or attorneys. The form requires a witness signature (not HIPAA-mandated), has zero fillable fields despite being digitally created, and bundles all sensitive record categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS) into a single all-or-nothing authorization. No mention of the Right of Access, the 30-day deadline, or fee limits appears anywhere.

**Alabama Medical Group** (physician practice, generic-only) epitomizes the problem. Its "Request for Release of Information" form collects Social Security Numbers — unnecessary and risky for patient self-access. The purpose checkboxes list "Legal," "Insurance," and "Evaluation & Treatment" before "Other," forcing patients to write in their own reason. No submission instructions appear on the form itself. The form hasn't been updated since 2018.

**Addabbo Family Health Center** (FQHC, generic-only) uses New York's OCA Form 960, a state court authorization form whose instructions explicitly say it was "designed for release of health information needed for litigation." Patients exercising a non-litigation right must navigate six numbered legal disclosures — including HIV redisclosure warnings and all-caps attorney restrictions — before reaching any fillable field.

## The Patient Experience Gap

When a patient encounters a generic authorization form for self-access, they face:

1. **Wrong framing** — "I authorize disclosure TO…" instead of "I am requesting MY records." The entire transaction is framed as consent rather than as a right.
2. **Irrelevant fields** — Recipient name/address, relationship to patient, purpose-of-disclosure checkboxes designed for third parties. Patients must awkwardly fit themselves into fields meant for lawyers, insurers, and other providers.
3. **Missing rights information** — Generic forms virtually never mention the 30-day response deadline, fee limits ($6.50 per page cap for paper, reasonable cost-based for electronic), right to electronic format, or right to direct records to a third party of the patient's choosing.
4. **Legalistic language** — "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" (Guthrie) rather than "I am requesting my own records."

## The Contrast

**Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital** (regional system) shows what "both" looks like: a standard authorization form for third-party releases, a separate EHI Computer Readable Export Request form pre-checked for "Patient Request – Electronic," fee disclosure stating "Initial Patient Request: No Charge," and bilingual availability. The standard form itself includes a "released to myself" branch with delivery format options (MyChart, email, paper, CD, fax). Patient-centeredness score: 4/5 vs. the 2.8 average for generic-only orgs.

**Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital** maintains entirely separate forms — a "Patient Request for Health Information" with "Myself" as the first recipient option, distinct from the third-party "Authorization to Release." Patient-centeredness: 5/5.

## Conclusion

The wrong-form problem is systemic and pervasive. Seven in ten organizations treat a patient requesting their own records identically to a subpoena or insurance request. The 1.4-point patient-centeredness gap between generic-only (2.8) and both-form organizations (4.2) is the single largest quality differential in the study. This is not primarily a documentation failure — it reflects a conceptual failure to distinguish between two fundamentally different legal frameworks: authorization for third-party disclosure (§ 164.508) and individual right of access (§ 164.524).
