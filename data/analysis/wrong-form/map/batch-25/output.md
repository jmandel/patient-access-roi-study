# The Wrong Form Problem — Batch 25 Analysis

## Summary

Of 195 organizations in this batch, the vast majority — 142 (72.8%) — offer patients only a **generic HIPAA authorization form** designed for third-party release when the patient wants to request their own records under the Right of Access (§ 164.524). Just 22 organizations (11.3%) provide a **dedicated patient access form** or clearly differentiate self-access from third-party release. Another 19 (9.7%) route patients through an **online portal**, and 12 (6.2%) could not be determined (missing data or phone/in-person only).

| Classification | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Generic authorization only | 142 | 72.8% |
| Dedicated patient form (or both) | 22 | 11.3% |
| Portal-only | 19 | 9.7% |
| Not determined | 12 | 6.2% |

## What Makes the Generic Form a Poor Fit

The core mismatch is conceptual: a § 164.508 authorization form asks the patient to *authorize disclosure to a third party*, while § 164.524 grants patients a *right to access their own records*. When an organization offers only the former, patients requesting their own records encounter several concrete problems:

**Nonsensical recipient fields.** The most common issue. Forms structured as "I authorize [Hospital] to release records TO: [Name, Address, Fax]" force patients to write their own name and address in fields designed for attorneys, insurers, or other providers. Columbus Community Hospital's form exemplifies this: a patient must fill in "release the following information on [patient] to: [Name and Address]" with their own details — "an unintuitive workaround with no guidance that this is a valid or expected use of the form."

**Mandatory purpose-of-release fields.** Under HIPAA, patients need not state a reason for accessing their own records. Yet generic forms routinely demand one. Barrett Hospital lists "Personal Use" as one circled option among several on a general-purpose form. Desert Regional Medical Center defaults to "Continuation of Care" as the first purpose option, underscoring the form's third-party orientation.

**Intimidating legal language.** Third-party authorization forms carry re-disclosure warnings, liability waivers, and conditioning language that are irrelevant — and potentially chilling — for patient self-access. Troy Regional Medical Center bundles a broad liability waiver requiring patients to "discharge facility from all liabilities as condition of signing." Barrett Hospital includes language about conditioning treatment on signing. These provisions make legal sense for third-party releases but are inappropriate when a patient exercises a statutory right.

**Witness and notarization lines.** Twenty-eight generic-only organizations flag a witness signature requirement, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access. Millinocket Regional Hospital combines a witness line with "All spaces on this form MUST be completed" language, effectively requiring a witness. Tioga Medical Center's witness field similarly implies it must be completed.

**SSN collection.** Thirty-nine organizations' forms request Social Security Numbers — an unnecessary identity-theft risk for a patient simply requesting their own records. Rio Grande Hospital collects SSN as a standard identifier field.

**Fee confusion.** JPS Health Network charges a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery without distinguishing patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based amounts) from third-party fees (governed by state law at higher rates). Saratoga Hospital lists $0.75/page without noting that flat per-page fees are generally impermissible for patient access under HIPAA.

## Patient-Centeredness Scores

The 142 generic-only organizations averaged a patient-centeredness score of **2.89 out of 5**, with 22 scoring a 2 (patient self-access is "an afterthought") and none scoring below 2. By contrast, the 22 organizations with dedicated patient access forms include exemplars like Northwell Health (score 5), which provides a separate "Request for Access to Health Information" form explicitly citing § 164.524, with "To me" as the first recipient option.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Generic-only forms appear across all facility types: community hospitals (53), critical access hospitals (27), teaching hospitals (24), physician practices (21), and FQHCs (17). The problem is not confined to small or under-resourced organizations — major teaching hospitals and system-affiliated facilities also default to generic authorization forms.

## The Contrast: What Good Looks Like

Organizations like Northwell Health, Intermountain Health, and Providence demonstrate the alternative. They publish **separate forms** — one for patient self-access (titled "Request for Access," citing § 164.524, with "Myself" as the default recipient) and one for third-party release. Northwell's patient access form is fillable, 2 pages, includes companion instructions, and offers delivery via USB, CD, secure email, fax, mail, or pickup. This is what patient-centered design looks like.

## Conclusion

Nearly three-quarters of organizations in this batch hand patients the wrong form. The generic HIPAA authorization — with its third-party framing, mandatory purpose fields, liability waivers, and recipient address blocks — creates confusion, unnecessary friction, and legal mismatch for patients exercising a fundamental right. The fix is straightforward: publish a separate, dedicated patient access form. The 11% of organizations that already do this prove it is feasible.
