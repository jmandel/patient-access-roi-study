You are investigating a specific problem in healthcare record access: organizations
that offer patients a generic third-party authorization form when the patient actually wants
to request their OWN records under HIPAA's Right of Access.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata.

Your task: for each org in this batch, classify its access pathway:
- Does it offer a DEDICATED patient access form (designed for individual access under § 164.524)?
- Does it only offer a GENERIC HIPAA authorization form (designed for third-party release)?
- Does it offer BOTH (separate forms for each purpose)?
- Is it PORTAL-ONLY (no downloadable form)?
- Could you NOT DETERMINE from the available materials?

For orgs using only a generic form: what specifically makes it a poor fit for patient
self-access? What would a patient experience — confusion, extra fields, wrong framing?

Tally counts. Cite specific examples of the mismatch problem.

## Forms and Pathways Available

UTMB provides three downloaded documents, but the most important distinction is between two form types: **Form 7033** ("Patients Request for Medical Records," form-1.pdf, dated April 2023) is a dedicated patient self-request form, while **Form 7032** (form-2.pdf, revised May 2024) is a general HIPAA authorization for third-party release. A third document (form-3.pdf) is an outdated 2016 version of Form 7032 hosted by Champion Records Service, a third-party ROI vendor. For a patient requesting their own records, **Form 7033 is the relevant document**.

UTMB also offers an online portal through Datavant/Swellbox as a digital alternative to the paper forms, and the medical records page references this option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UTMB earns genuine credit for maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access versus third-party release** — a design choice that relatively few organizations make. Form 7033 omits irrelevant fields (purpose of request, representative documentation requirements) and adds patient-relevant features (MyChart delivery, email delivery, email encryption disclosure). Form 7032, by contrast, has only a "Signature of Authorized Personal Representative" line with no patient signature option, and requires documentation of authority to act on the patient's behalf. This structural separation demonstrates intentional consideration of the patient self-request use case.

However, the forms do not cross-reference each other. A patient who finds Form 7032 (whether on UTMB's site or the third-party copy) has no indication that the more appropriate Form 7033 exists.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy to moderate**. A single web search surfaced UTMB's medical records page at `utmb.edu/utmbhealth/online-services/medical-records`, which lists forms with download links under a logical "Online Services > Request Medical Records" navigation path. The complication is that PDFs are hosted on SharePoint (`liveutmb.sharepoint.com`), which requires browser-based download — programmatic access (curl) returns login pages. For a typical patient using a web browser, this is a non-issue.

## Form Document Quality

Form 7033 is a **single-page, text-based PDF** with a clean text layer (no OCR artifacts, not an image scan). It flows logically: patient identification → recipient/delivery method → record scope → expiration → signature → submission instructions. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all fields must be completed by hand after printing or via PDF annotation tools. This is the primary technical shortcoming.

The form offers **four delivery options** for records: mail, fax, email, and MyChart Patient Portal. It also provides **three submission methods** for the form itself: mail, fax, and email (himrio@utmb.edu). The email submission option is a notable convenience that eliminates the need for a printer or fax machine.

Language is generally clear and functional, though institutional rather than warm. The email encryption risk disclosure is a model of transparent, plain-language communication. The form asks for approximately 10–12 fields (name, address, DOB, phone, recipient info, record scope, dates, signature).

## Barriers and Gaps

- **No fillable fields**: Despite digital distribution, the form cannot be completed electronically in standard PDF readers.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. HIPAA limits patient access fees to a reasonable, cost-based amount, but patients have no idea what to expect.
- **No turnaround time stated**: No response timeline is communicated.
- **No patient rights statement**: The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access or explain patient rights.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records are authorized in a single blanket statement with no opt-out mechanism for individual categories.
- **No multilingual support**: Notable for a Galveston, TX institution serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — email, fax, and mail are all available.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-request form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **MyChart portal delivery option** on the authorization form itself — few organizations integrate portal delivery directly into their ROI form.
- **Email submission** of the completed form at himrio@utmb.edu — lowers the barrier significantly.
- **Transparent email encryption disclosure** — clearly written, appropriately informative without being alarming.
- **Datavant/Swellbox online portal** as a digital alternative pathway.

## Overall Assessment

UTMB demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its structural decision to maintain separate patient and third-party forms, and through the variety of delivery and submission options. The organization clearly thought about the patient self-access use case. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (undermining the digital workflow), absence of fee/rights/turnaround information, and no multilingual support. The availability of email submission and an online portal partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF. Overall, UTMB earns a **B grade** — meaningfully better than average, with room for improvement in document interactivity and patient education.

# SSM Health DePaul Hospital - St. Louis: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health DePaul Hospital in Bridgeton, MO is part of the SSM Health system, a major nonprofit health system operating across the Midwest. The hospital does not maintain its own medical records request forms; instead, it relies on SSM Health's system-wide forms. Two versions were found: an older system-wide form (form-1, "SSMHC" branding, dated 1/2019) and a current St. Louis metro–specific form (form-2, "SSM Health" branding). Form-2 is the applicable document for DePaul Hospital patients. Additionally, SSM Health's medical records page references an electronic request option through the **MRO Express portal** (mroexpress.mrocorp.com) for Missouri facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Both forms are dual-purpose documents titled "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," combining individual access requests and third-party disclosure authorizations into a single instrument. A patient requesting their own records must navigate structure designed for third-party releases — including a "disclose my protected health information to" recipient block with name, address, fax, and relationship fields. The "For personal access" option exists only as a checkbox buried under the "Purpose of Disclosure" section, alongside options like "Insurance/Workers' Compensation" and "Legal."

This dual-purpose design means patients must determine which fields to fill, which to skip, and how to route a form that assumes a releasing-to and releasing-from party. While technically functional, it is not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required moderate effort. The SSM Health medical records page (ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records) uses location-dependent content loading to surface region-specific forms, but the location selector's autocomplete reportedly failed during testing. Starting from DePaul Hospital's location page, the "Get Medical Records" link redirects to the system-wide page without directly linking the St. Louis metro form. A web search for SSM Health medical records forms did surface both PDFs, and the form-2 URL is descriptively structured. Overall, a patient would need 3+ clicks and some navigation persistence.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 — the relevant document — is a **single-page fillable PDF with 69 interactive fields**, representing a genuine digital-first design. Patients can complete the entire form electronically in any PDF viewer without printing. This is a clear strength. The form includes fields for patient demographics, type of access (inspection, hard copy, electronic copy), record type checkboxes with date fields (including sensitive categories like substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV-related information), purpose of disclosure, and a seven-item acknowledgement section covering HIPAA rights.

However, the language is **legalistic** throughout. The acknowledgement section contains seven dense paragraphs written in formal legal register. There are no separate instructions, no plain-language summary, and no guidance helping patients understand which fields apply to their situation. The single-page constraint results in compressed formatting and small text in the acknowledgement section. The form is English-only.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and **no in-person submission mandate**. Fees are disclosed as possible ("I may be required to pay the cost of creating paper copies or electronic media") but without specific amounts and with a TPO exception carve-out. A 30-day response time is committed, and the right to request review of access denials is clearly stated. Revocation rights and non-conditioning of care are explicitly covered.

The most notable concern is the **email delivery warning**: SSM Health states that encrypted email is "the only way to avoid third party interception" and frames unencrypted email delivery as a risky exception requiring patient acknowledgement. While email delivery is technically offered (form-2 includes an email field), the discouraging language may deter patients from choosing electronic delivery. An expiration date field — with research-oriented options — is misplaced for patient access requests and may confuse non-research requestors.

## Notable Strengths

- **69 fillable form fields** on a single page — genuinely fillable, not a flat scan
- **Email delivery option** with explicit email address field (form-2 improvement over form-1)
- **Granular record type selection** with sensitive-category breakouts for substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV
- **MRO Express portal** as an alternative electronic request pathway
- **Clear rights statements** covering 30-day timeline, denial review, and revocation

## Key Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as insurance companies and attorneys
- **Legalistic language** with no plain-language guidance or instructions
- **Email delivery framed as risky exception** rather than standard option
- **English-only** — no multilingual support
- **Expiration date field** inappropriate for patient access requests

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health DePaul Hospital earns a **C grade**. The fillable PDF form and MRO Express portal provide adequate technical infrastructure, and the form covers HIPAA compliance basics without imposing illegitimate barriers. However, the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, combined with dense legal language and no patient-facing guidance, means a patient must work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights. The org meets minimum requirements but falls short of patient-centered design.

# Massachusetts General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), part of the Mass General Brigham system (formerly Partners HealthCare), provides a single general-purpose authorization form for all records release requests. Three versions of this form were found at different URLs, representing the form's evolution from 2016 through 2024. The current version (form-1.pdf, MGB00087 06/24) is the clear best-available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Forms and Pathways

All three downloaded documents are versions of the same form — "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information." The current version is hosted on the parent system domain (massgeneralbrigham.org), while two older versions persist at legacy URLs on massgeneral.org. There is no dedicated patient access request form, online portal, or web-based request wizard. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it, and submitting via mail or fax.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MGH does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The same authorization form serves patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient selects "Personal" from the purpose checkboxes and checks a box to have records mailed to their own address. The form references HIPAA authorization requirements (§ 164.508) but never mentions the patient's Right of Access under § 164.524. This means a patient requesting their own records navigates a process designed primarily for third-party disclosure — workable, but not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, CAPTCHAs, or login requirements. The main concern is that two superseded versions remain publicly accessible at legacy URLs, creating a risk that patients could download an outdated, non-fillable version. The current form lives on the parent system domain rather than massgeneral.org, which could confuse patients who start at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a 2-page digitally native PDF with **78 fillable interactive fields** — a significant upgrade from the older versions, which had zero fillable fields. The form follows a clear A–E section structure: patient information, permission to share, information to be released, sensitive information consent, and terms/signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and logical flow.

Language is moderately plain — straightforward instructions at the top, clear section labels, and accessible phrasing in most areas. The required regulatory language in Section D (42 CFR Part 2 for substance use records) is necessarily dense but presented legibly. Section E's terms are written in clear, formal prose with important patient protections stated explicitly ("This authorization is voluntary"; treatment will not be conditioned on signing).

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: Patient Gateway (patient portal), secure email, fax, and paper mail — giving patients genuine electronic options for record receipt. However, submission of the form itself is limited to mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No electronic form submission**: Despite 78 fillable fields enabling digital completion, the form must be printed and mailed or faxed. Fax is an adequate electronic pathway per study criteria, so this is not a major penalty, but the gap between fillable fields and fax-only submission is a missed opportunity.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form notes "Copying fees may apply" for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes. Personal and Medical Care are not asterisked, implying no fees — but this is never stated affirmatively. HIPAA limits fees for patient access, and this distinction deserves explicit clarification.
- **Mandatory date specification**: Patients "MUST specify dates" for every record type requested, with no "all records" option. This could burden patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Stale versions at legacy URLs**: Two outdated, non-fillable versions remain publicly accessible, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Fillable PDF with comprehensive field coverage** (78 fields) — active investment in digital accessibility
- **Four electronic delivery options** including patient portal and secure email
- **Granular sensitive-information consent** with seven separate opt-in categories (HIV, genetics, substance use, mental health, social work, domestic violence, sexual assault)
- **Clear non-coercion statement** and voluntary authorization language
- **No notarization or witness required**
- **Version-controlled form** with clear identifiers (MGB00087 06/24)

## Overall Assessment

MGH provides a competent, well-structured authorization form with strong technical execution (fillable fields, electronic delivery options) but falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form. The form is easy to find, clearly organized, and free of major barriers. The primary gaps are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, ambiguous fee language, and the persistence of outdated form versions online. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process was designed for institutional release workflows rather than individual access rights.

# JPS Health Network — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

JPS Health Network (John Peter Smith Hospital) is a government-owned community hospital in Fort Worth, TX. The organization's Patient Records page offers three downloadable forms: a primary ROI authorization form (English, with a Spanish version also available), an HIE opt-in authorization, and an HIE revocation form. Only the ROI form (form-1) is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records.

## Forms & Pathways

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is a single-page **Authorization & Request for Release of Information** PDF (form-1.pdf), last revised October 2018. This is a generic ROI form — it does not differentiate between patient self-access requests under HIPAA § 164.524 and third-party release authorizations. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no patient portal pathway mentioned on the records page.

The two HIE-related forms (form-2 and form-3) are irrelevant to patient self-access — they govern provider-to-provider data sharing via a health information exchange.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The Patient Records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records), and web searches also surface the direct PDF URL. The page uses accordion sections to organize content, with the ROI form under "JPS Authorization Form." Fee information and submission instructions are disclosed on the page before download — a transparency positive.

## Form Document Quality

The ROI form is the weakest element of JPS's patient access process. It is an **image-only scan** — a photograph of a paper form with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no extractable text (literally 1 character of output from text extraction). At 478 KB for a single page, it is technically a picture, not a document. It cannot be completed digitally, is invisible to screen readers, and fails basic digital accessibility standards.

The irony is sharp: JPS's 2025 HIE forms demonstrate the organization can produce modern, fillable, text-searchable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The core ROI form — the one patients actually need — remains a 2018 scan that has not been updated in over seven years.

The form is one page, which is an appropriate length. However, because it is an image-only scan, detailed analysis of layout, language clarity, field count, and instructions is limited to visual inspection rather than text analysis.

## Access Pathway Assessment

JPS does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The single ROI form appears to serve all release purposes. The fee schedule on the web page does not distinguish between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees (which Texas state law governs at higher rates). This conflation is a significant patient-centeredness gap.

Submission is limited to **print, handwrite, and mail or fax**. The Patient Records page explicitly states: "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time." Fax is available (which counts as an adequate electronic pathway and avoids the worst penalties), but the form itself cannot be filled digitally — it must be printed and handwritten.

## Barriers

- **Potentially excessive fees**: $30 for the first 10 pages, per-page charges thereafter, and a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery. The $75 electronic delivery fee likely exceeds HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based" standard for patient access requests. The fee schedule does not distinguish patient access from third-party requests.
- **No electronic form submission**: Despite having the technical capability (demonstrated by HIE forms accepting encrypted email), JPS refuses electronic submission of the ROI form.
- **Government photo ID required at pickup**: Standard practice but limits delivery to in-person collection.
- **Stale form**: Over 7 years old, predating HHS Right of Access enforcement actions and 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish language version** available for the ROI form, appropriate for Fort Worth demographics.
- **Fee disclosure** is transparent — patients know costs before downloading the form.
- **Easy findability** — the form is prominent and well-organized on the website.
- **HIE forms show capability** — the 2025 HIE forms prove JPS can do better, which makes the outdated ROI form a choice rather than a limitation.

## Overall Assessment

JPS Health Network presents a frustrating contradiction. The organization clearly has the technical capability and institutional will to produce modern, accessible digital forms — the 2025 HIE forms are well-designed, fillable, and accept encrypted email submission. Yet the core ROI form that patients actually need to request their own records remains a seven-year-old image scan with no digital functionality. Combined with potentially excessive fees and no electronic submission, the patient experience is well below what this organization could deliver. The form is easy to find, and fax submission is available, but the document itself is a relic that creates unnecessary barriers for patients exercising their access rights.

# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center provides three downloadable documents, but only one is relevant for patient self-access: **form-3.pdf**, the current "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (CONS00337, dated LRH 01/22). This single-page PDF is linked from the organization's [Medical Records page](https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/) and is the actively maintained ROI form. An older version of the same form (form-1.pdf, dated 04/16) remains publicly accessible at a separate URL but is no longer linked from the site. The third document (form-2.pdf) is an LRH Physicians Group Release/Authorization Form — a multi-purpose intake/consent bundle covering insurance assignment, billing, and treatment consent — and is not a patient-initiated records request form.

In addition to the PDF form, the organization offers a **Swellbox digital intake wizard** (http://www.swellbox.com/lakeland-wizard.html) as an alternative electronic pathway, which is a meaningful digital option for patients who prefer not to deal with paper.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lakeland Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (form-3) is a generic HIPAA authorization with bidirectional language — "to disclose my PHI to" and "to obtain my PHI from" — using checkboxes for each direction. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should check "to disclose my PHI to" and enter their own name and address as the recipient, an unintuitive workflow. There is no dedicated patient access form, no simplified request pathway, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). The form treats patient self-access identically to third-party release, including applying the same fee structure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Lakeland Regional Health medical records release form returned direct PDF links immediately, and the Medical Records page is straightforward to locate via site navigation. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor concern is that the superseded 2016 version remains publicly accessible without any "outdated" marking, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-3) is a **clean, digitally-authored single-page PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is logical and reasonably organized, flowing from patient identification through recipient details, date range, delivery method, record type checkboxes (13 categories plus "Other"), sensitive information notice, five legal clauses, and signature blocks. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — the numbered "I understand that..." clauses are reasonably accessible, though the fee reference to Florida statutes without disclosing actual amounts is opaque.

Three delivery options are offered: Paper, Electronic (email), and MyChart Patient Portal — a forward-thinking inclusion. The form provides granular record-type selection with 13 specific categories, and includes a patient-protective redaction option for mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records.

## Barriers

**Fee disclosure** is a notable weakness: patients must "agree to pay charges... per Florida Statute 395.3025 or Florida Administrative Code 64B8-10.003" without knowing what those charges are. This state fee schedule reference may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests, and the form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release fee structures.

A **witness signature line** appears on the form without clear indication of whether it is required or optional. If required, this creates a logistical barrier for patients completing the form at home or remotely. The form also collects the **last four digits of SSN**, which is unnecessary when MRN, name, DOB, and address are already requested. A "Photo ID verified" checkbox is ambiguous — if interpreted as requiring in-person ID presentation, it could conflict with electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Swellbox digital intake** provides a fully electronic alternative pathway
- **MyChart Patient Portal** as a delivery option leverages existing infrastructure
- **Granular record-type selection** (13 categories) gives patients meaningful control
- **Sensitive information redaction option** with explicit notice is a patient-protective feature
- **Single-page conciseness** keeps the form efficient and reduces patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Lakeland Regional Health provides a **serviceable but undifferentiated** records request experience. The form is easy to find, concise, and reasonably well-organized, with some genuinely patient-friendly features (granular record selection, redaction option, MyChart delivery). However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access, failing to disclose fees, and including potentially unnecessary requirements (witness, partial SSN). The availability of Swellbox as a digital alternative partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF, but the core form experience remains paper-first. The organization earns credit for accessibility and findability but loses ground on patient-centeredness and compliance nuances.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MUSC Health University Medical Center in Charleston, SC is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina health system. The organization provides three pathways for patients to request their medical records: a downloadable PDF authorization form, MyChart patient portal, and an online Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool. Three documents were retrieved: the English authorization form (form-1), a MyChart instructional guide (form-2), and a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway Assessment

MUSC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary pathway is a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form that serves both patient access and third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same "Release Records From" / "Release Records To" framework designed for third-party disclosures, filling in their own name as both patient and recipient — an unintuitive experience. The form includes "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" as one of eight purpose-of-release checkboxes, but patient self-access is not called out as a distinct pathway.

However, MUSC partially compensates by offering the MyChart portal pathway, where patients can submit records requests electronically. The MyChart guide (form-2) describes a step-by-step process for requesting records within the portal, though it prominently warns about fees and a prepayment requirement. The Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool is a third option but requires webcam identity verification, adding friction.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A standard web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL at a clean, descriptive path (`muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf`). The medical records landing page links directly to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. The Spanish version was similarly accessible at a predictable URL. This is a model of straightforward form availability.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a significant shortcoming given that the form offers modern delivery options like encrypted email and MyChart. The form was clearly designed digitally (9 fonts, clean layout) but not built for digital completion.

The layout follows a logical progression: patient demographics → records source/destination → record types → purpose → date range → delivery method → legal disclosures → signature. The record-type options are well-designed, including a helpfully defined "Abstract" option. Five delivery methods are offered (mail, MyChart, fax, encrypted email, other) — above average for ROI forms. However, page 1 is dense, with legal disclosures compressed into a wall of small-print text at the bottom.

Language is a mix of plain instructions and legal/regulatory terminology. The opening warning ("FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION") is clear but intimidating. Rights disclosures reference specific CFR sections, which is appropriate but not patient-friendly.

## Barriers and Concerns

Several barriers exist. The form requires a **witness signature** — a line with no explanation of when or whether it's required, likely confusing patients into thinking it's always mandatory. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests. The form also requires attaching **a copy of patient identification** for all requests, not just representative requests — an extra step that adds friction for patients without easy copier access. The request for the **last 4 digits of SSN** is unnecessary for patient identification and may deter some patients.

The fee situation is a notable red flag. The MyChart instructional guide explicitly states that fees apply to "all patient requests released to the patient" including "search and duplication" — HIPAA only permits reasonable cost-based fees (not search fees) for patient access requests. The guide also describes a **prepayment requirement** before records are released, which may conflict with HHS/OCR guidance on patient access rights.

## Bright Spots

MUSC demonstrates genuine effort in several areas. The **Spanish-language form** (form-3) is a full professional translation preserving the complete structure and content of the English original, with bilingual headers — uncommon among organizations in this study. **Multiple pathways** (PDF, MyChart, Ciox eRequest) give patients genuine choice. **Multiple delivery methods** including encrypted email show digital awareness. The **multi-facility contact directory** on page 2 provides complete information for 9 MUSC locations, and the form explicitly references **45 CFR §164.524** (right to inspect/copy), making HIPAA rights visible to patients.

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health earns a **B grade** overall. The organization makes forms easy to find, offers multiple request pathways and delivery options, provides a Spanish-language version, and includes patient rights language. However, the generic third-party authorization form is not designed around patient self-access, the PDF lacks fillable fields despite digital distribution, and the fee/prepayment language raises compliance concerns. The witness signature and blanket ID requirements add unnecessary barriers. A dedicated patient access form with fillable fields and clearer fee disclosures would meaningfully improve the patient experience.

# Memorial Healthcare System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Memorial Healthcare System (Hollywood, FL) is a government-owned regional hospital system serving South Florida. The system's medical records page provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" form available in three languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole), plus a separate Request for Amendment form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form; all record requests flow through the same HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release.

## Pathways and Primary Form

The primary pathway is a downloadable PDF form (form-1.pdf in English) linked from the main website at Patients & Visitors > Medical Records. The form lists five delivery methods — Pick-up, Mail Out, e-Delivery, CD, and MyChart — prominently at the top, showing the org supports both traditional and electronic record delivery. MyChart is referenced as a delivery option, suggesting patients may also be able to request records through their patient portal. The medical records page states a two-business-day processing commitment, far faster than the HIPAA-allowed 30-day window.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is titled "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" and is structured around disclosing records to a named recipient (Section 4: "This information is to be released to: Name / Address"). While an email field explicitly reads "I request my records be sent to me at this e-mail address" — clear patient-access language — the overall form design is a generic authorization. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and Section 5h requires patients to state a purpose for the disclosure, which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form and process as an attorney or insurer, figuring out which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The medical records page is linked from the main navigation, the PDF is directly downloadable without login or CAPTCHA, and all language versions are grouped on the same page. No bot blocking was encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — every checkbox, text field, and signature line must be completed by hand after printing. This is consistent across all three language versions. The file is bloated at 2.45 MB (vs. ~700 KB for the identically structured Spanish and Creole versions), with 23 embedded fonts and garbled hidden content from overlapping template layers — including staff business cards, physician rosters, and internal template labels like "JDCH Oncology BC (Multiple Doctors & Locations) FRONT." This hidden content inflates file size and produces garbled output for assistive technologies.

The form's content is organized in five numbered sections with logical flow: facility selection, patient identification, record type selection (~15 granular options), recipient information, and acknowledgment statements. The acknowledgments (Sections 5a–5h) are dense legal text — particularly the electronic delivery risk-shifting language in 5e, which requires patients to "knowingly and voluntarily assume this risk and all consequences, losses and damages" for electronic records. This language could discourage patients from exercising their right to receive records electronically.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No notarization or witness is required.** Fees are not disclosed on the form itself; the website mentions "copy charges as authorized by Florida law" with an exception for records sent to treating physicians. The six-month authorization expiration is standard. No in-person-only submission restriction exists — forms can be mailed. However, there is no explicit electronic submission pathway for the form itself (no fax, no email-based submission explicitly stated, though MyChart may serve this role).

**Bright spots** are notable. The trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is exemplary and uncommon — most organizations offer at most English and Spanish. The five delivery methods, including e-Delivery and MyChart, are forward-thinking. The two-business-day processing commitment is remarkably fast. Granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control.

**Red flags** include the electronic delivery risk-shifting language (Section 5e), the purpose field that may create an impression that patients need to justify their access, and the bloated English PDF with garbled hidden content that affects accessibility tools.

## Overall Assessment

Memorial Healthcare System demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness in several areas — multilingual access, fast processing, and electronic delivery options — but is held back by a non-fillable, generic authorization form that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The form's paper-based workflow and dense legal language create unnecessary friction. The org earns a solid **B** grade overall: excellent findability and some compliance strengths offset by a fundamentally paper-based process and a form that wasn't designed with patients as the primary audience.

# Nemaha Valley Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital, an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Seneca, Kansas, provides two documents on its Resources page: an "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-2.pdf). The authorization form is the only mechanism available for patients to request their records. A Spanish-language version of the authorization form is also linked from the same page but was not separately downloaded for evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for disclosures to named third parties — a patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient and navigate fields (purpose, recipient address) that assume a third-party disclosure scenario. There is no mention of HIPAA § 164.524, no "right of access" language, and no separate pathway for individual access requests. The NPP, by contrast, does describe the right to inspect and obtain copies and even commits to providing records in electronic format upon request — but this information lives in a 12-page compliance document, not in the actual request form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) is accessible within two clicks from the homepage, and a site-scoped web search surfaced the link quickly. The page labels the form clearly as "Authorization for Release of Health Information." No bot blocking or access restrictions were encountered. General `filetype:pdf` searches did not return direct results, but this is a minor issue given how easily the form was found through site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a significant weakness. It is an **image-only scan** — a photocopy of a paper form scanned by a Savin copier in 2016, with zero extractable text, zero fillable fields, and no accessibility metadata. The revision date is January 2014, making it over a decade old. The form must be printed and filled out entirely by hand.

The layout is functional but dated, using a typewriter-style font with hand-drawn lines. Page 1 follows a logical sequence: patient identification, recipient designation, purpose, a 14-item record-type checklist, treatment date range, legal disclosures, and signature block. Page 2 is an internal cost-calculation worksheet that probably should not have been included in the patient-facing download — it shows per-page copy rates, labor charges, and staff-use fields for tracking releases. Both pages are erroneously labeled "Page 2 of 2."

The legal language is reasonably clear for a healthcare authorization form, but it is presented as dense paragraph text with no bold headings or visual breaks between disclosure sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable red flag is the **Social Security Number field**, which is prominently placed alongside name, birthdate, and MRN. SSN collection is unnecessary for medical records release and creates identity theft risk — especially concerning for a form that must be physically handled (printed, mailed, or hand-delivered).

The form provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address for the records department, no fax number, and no mention of email or portal submission. A patient would need to call the hospital to learn how to submit the completed form. The cost worksheet on page 2 references pick-up, mail, and fax as record delivery methods, suggesting fax capability exists, but no fax number is provided on the form itself.

Fees are very reasonable: $0.03 per page for copies, with a $3.90 per 15-minute labor charge. The per-page rate is well within HIPAA limits. The $10 charges for CDs and USB drives are dated but not egregious.

## Notable Strengths

Despite its weaknesses, the hospital has several bright spots. The availability of a **Spanish-language authorization form** is notable for a small rural hospital in Kansas. The **14-item record-type checklist** gives patients granular control over what is released. The **NPP is excellent** — recently updated (February 2026), it names a specific Privacy Officer with direct phone and email, commits to electronic format delivery, includes HIE participation transparency, and offers multilingual nondiscrimination taglines in 15+ languages. The contrast between the polished, current NPP and the decade-old scanned authorization form is striking.

## Overall Assessment

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital earns a **C grade**. The form is easy to find and fees are fair, but the core patient experience is undermined by an image-only scan that forces a fully paper-based workflow, a generic third-party authorization form with no patient access differentiation, an SSN field that creates unnecessary risk, and a complete absence of submission instructions. The hospital clearly has the capacity to produce quality digital documents (as evidenced by the NPP), but has not applied that capability to its records request process.

# University Medical Center of Southern Nevada — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC) is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Las Vegas. Three documents were retrieved: two versions of the same PHI Release Authorization form (a current 2019 version and a superseded 2016 version) and a Request for Amendment form. The primary form for patient self-access is the 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

UMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting one's own records is a generic "Protected Health Information (PHI) Release Authorization" form — the same form used for third-party disclosures to attorneys, insurers, and other providers. The form includes a "Patient (self)" checkbox under the recipient section, which adapts it for self-access use, but the framing remains third-party-oriented: "I authorize the following facility(ies) to release my Protected Health Information." A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access must navigate the same full authorization form as someone authorizing release to a third party, including selecting a "purpose" (Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Care) — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access requests.

## Findability: A Significant Gap

The most striking finding is a disconnect between the website and the ROI form. UMC's Medical Records page (`umcsn.com/patients-visitors/patient-information/medical-records-and-birth-certificate-process`) links only to the Request for Amendment form — it does **not** link to the PHI Release Authorization that patients need to request copies of their records. The ROI form is only discoverable via web search or by knowing the direct URL. Compounding this, the superseded 2016 version remains hosted at an active URL with no indication it is obsolete, meaning patients could unknowingly submit the wrong version. This is a serious findability failure for a core patient rights document.

## Form Document Quality

The 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf) is a two-page, digitally-composed PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (9 fonts, 3 embedded images), it offers no interactive form fields. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and then determine how to submit it.

The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → facility selection → record type selection → sensitive information consent → recipient → purpose/format → legal statements → signature. The structure is reasonable, but institutional conventions undermine usability. The header instruction "PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" assumes clinical context meaningless to a patient at home. An unexplained barcode-like code ("*ROIRCD*") appears at the top. The header states "Page 1 of 1" on what is actually a 2-page document.

Language is mostly clear but formal. The sensitive information section deserves credit for its granular, well-explained approach — five categories (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, psychotherapy, genetic records) each with individual Yes/No consent and required initials.

## Submission: A Critical Omission

The ROI form specifies how records will be *delivered* to the patient (mail, fax, email, CD-ROM, pick-up) but does **not** state how to *submit the completed authorization*. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or portal URL appears on the form for submission. The only address on the form is for written revocation. By contrast, the amendment form (form-3) provides four clear submission channels: mail, walk-in, fax (702-207-8330), and email (HIMManagementAnalysts@umcsn.com). A patient would need to locate this information independently — likely from the Medical Records page that paradoxically doesn't link to the ROI form.

## Barriers and Compliance

UMC avoids several common barriers: no notarization is required, Social Security Number is explicitly marked as optional, and the form includes good rights language (voluntariness, non-conditioning of treatment, right to revoke). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "subject to reproduction fees in accordance with federal / state regulations" — without specifying amounts or noting that fees for patient self-access are limited by law. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions found.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular sensitive information controls**: Five-category consent with individual opt-in/opt-out is better than most ROI forms
- **Email as a delivery option**: Listed alongside mail, fax, CD-ROM, and pick-up
- **SS# marked optional**: Explicit labeling that many forms omit
- **"Patient (self)" checkbox**: Acknowledges patient self-access as a use case

## Overall Assessment

UMC provides a functional but poorly surfaced records request process. The form itself is adequate — clearly structured with good sensitive-information handling and reasonable rights language. But the patient experience is undermined by three compounding failures: the form isn't linked from the obvious website location, it isn't fillable despite being digitally composed, and it doesn't tell patients how to submit it. A patient navigating UMC's website in the expected way would find the amendment form but not the release authorization form. The organization treats records release as an institutional process that patients happen to participate in, rather than as a patient right that deserves a dedicated, discoverable pathway.

# Southwell (Tift Regional Health System) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Southwell's medical release page at `mysouthwell.com/medical-release/` presents four downloadable documents. Two are parallel ROI authorization forms — one for the hospital system (form-1, "TRHS Authorization to Release/Obtain PHI," 2 pages) and one for the ambulatory clinics (form-3, "SWA Authorization to Release Protected Health Information," 1 page). Form-2 is a newer image-only scan (July 2025, produced on a Canon copier) that appears to be a revised version of form-1 but with degraded quality and no text layer. Form-4 is a reference list of ~40 TRHS entity names and addresses, not an ROI form. The organization also references Verisma as an online records request partner at a separate page (`mysouthwell.com/medical-record-request/`), but this pathway was not directly evaluated as part of the form download process.

The most relevant form for patient self-access at the hospital system is **form-1**, the TRHS authorization. It has a text layer, logical numbered structure, and covers the main hospital facilities. Form-3 serves the same role for ambulatory clinics.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Southwell does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All downloadable forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. They require the patient to name a recipient ("This information may be disclosed to and used by the following individual or organization") even when the patient is requesting records for personal use. "Personal Use" appears as one of six purpose checkboxes, but the form's architecture assumes a third-party release workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no simplified self-access flow. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, figuring out that they should write their own name in the "recipient" field.

The split between TRHS hospital forms and SWA ambulatory forms further fragments the experience. A patient who received care at both a hospital and a specialty clinic would need to complete two separate authorization forms for two different legal entities, with no clear guidance about which form covers which facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was relatively straightforward. The medical release page is accessible via the website's navigation (Home → Patient & Visitors → Medical Release), and web searches surfaced the page without difficulty. No bot blocking or login requirements were encountered. However, the page presents multiple forms without clear differentiation — patients must determine whether form-1, form-2, or form-3 applies to their situation, and the relationship between the overlapping TRHS forms (form-1 vs. form-2) is unclear.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 (the best available) has a text layer and logical numbered structure (8 sections covering facility selection, record types, sensitive info notice, recipient, purpose, revocation, non-conditioning, and voluntary disclosure). It offers good granularity in record type selection — 10 categories with individual date range fields, plus delivery options (Paper, CD, Electronic Delivery). However, the form has **zero fillable fields**. All checkboxes and text fields are static, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. The form does not specify how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, email address, or mailing instructions for submission appear on the form itself (the mailing address in Section 6 relates to revocation, not submission).

The language is moderately legalistic, with dense compliance-driven text in the sensitive information notice and revocation sections. The layout is functional but the second page contains only two short paragraphs and signature lines, suggesting it could be consolidated. Form-2 represents a regression — an image-only scan with no text layer, no OCR, degraded readability, and Paper pre-checked as the delivery method.

## Barriers

Two notable barriers exist. First, a **witness signature** is required on all forms — HIPAA does not require witnesses for authorization or access requests, and this creates a real obstacle for patients completing forms independently at home. Second, all forms collect the **last 4 digits of SSN**, an unnecessary data element that creates privacy risk beyond what MRN and DOB provide.

No fees are mentioned on any form. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated. The 90-day default expiration on forms 1 and 3 (extended to one year on form-2) could force resubmission if processing is slow.

## Overall Assessment

Southwell provides a minimally functional but decidedly paper-oriented records request process. The forms are findable and structurally organized, with useful features like granular record type selection and an electronic delivery option. However, the lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, the fragmented multi-form landscape, and the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway all reflect a process designed for institutional convenience rather than patient self-service. The organization appears to offer a Verisma online portal as an alternative, which could meaningfully improve the digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms remain firmly rooted in a print-and-mail paradigm.

# Desert Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Regional Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Palm Springs, CA, operated by Desert Care Network, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare. Two forms were found: an English-language ROI authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are 2-page digitally created PDFs available from a dedicated medical records page on the Desert Care Network website.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

Desert Regional does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization for the Release of Health Information" and are structured as third-party disclosure authorizations — the patient authorizes Desert Regional to release records *to* a named recipient. A patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient, an awkward workaround that conflates the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) with the authorization framework of § 164.508. There is no separate form, section, or instructions addressing patient self-access as a distinct use case.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient/patient representative" as one option, but "Continuation of Care" appears as the default/first option, further underscoring the form's third-party orientation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A direct `filetype:pdf` search yielded nothing, but a site-specific search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/patients/request-medical-records`. That page is well-organized, with per-hospital download links in both English and Spanish. Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic downloads, requiring browser-based workarounds — though a patient using a standard browser would not encounter this. Overall, the form is roughly 2–3 clicks from the homepage via a logical navigation path.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is digitally authored with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite. This is a significant missed opportunity given the digital-native construction. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, recipient info, 12 record-type checkboxes, date range, purpose, and delivery method. The layout is logical and readable, following a clear top-to-bottom sequence. Language tilts toward legal/administrative but is not impenetrably dense; the rights section uses standard HIPAA authorization language with four-exception conditional clauses that could benefit from plain-language explanation.

Delivery method options include patient pickup, mail, fax, and email — the inclusion of email is a positive differentiator. The form header provides phone, fax, and email contact for the HIM department, giving patients multiple submission channels.

## Spanish Translation Quality

The Spanish form (form-2.pdf) mirrors the English version in structure and content, but suffers from **pervasive typographical errors** — at least 9 distinct misspellings including "APCIENTE" (PACIENTE), "cofidencialidad" (confidencialidad), and "DIVILGACIÓN" (DIVULGACIÓN). More consequentially, the Spanish form **omits the delivery method section** entirely, meaning Spanish-speaking patients cannot indicate how they want to receive their records. The fax number in the Spanish header also appears truncated. These errors suggest the translation was not professionally reviewed and create a meaningful disparity in service quality for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no mandatory in-person submission, and no explicit fee requirements. Revocation rights and authorization expiration are clearly stated. However, the form says nothing about fees — neither disclosing them nor stating they don't apply for patient access. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, and the rights section covers only authorization-related rights (voluntariness, revocation). There is no mention of electronic health information export or the patient's right to receive records in their requested format.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful for the Coachella Valley's large Spanish-speaking population
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear, per-hospital download links
- **Email as a delivery option** is more progressive than many ROI forms
- **Multiple HIM contact channels** (phone, fax, email) on the form header

## Overall Assessment

Desert Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The primary pathway is a generic third-party release form with no differentiation for patient self-access — a common but patient-unfriendly pattern. The form is reasonably well-organized and findable, but the lack of fillable fields and the poor quality of the Spanish translation diminish the overall experience. A patient can submit via fax or email (adequate electronic pathways), but must first print and handwrite the form. The organization earns credit for bilingual availability and a clear website presence, but falls short on patient-centeredness and digital accessibility.

# Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center (VGMHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Hillsboro, Oregon, serving a predominantly Latino patient population. The organization publishes four Release of Information–related documents on its website: the main HIPAA ROI authorization form in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), plus a Release of Verbal Health Information form in English (form-3) and Spanish (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records is form-1 (or form-2 for Spanish speakers).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

VGMHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. A patient wanting their own records must use the same general-purpose HIPAA Release of Information form designed for inter-provider exchanges and third-party releases. The form asks the patient to choose a direction ("Get information," "Give information," or "Get and give information") and specify a recipient provider/facility — a workflow that doesn't map cleanly to "I want a copy of my own records."

A partial mitigation exists: the form includes "For my own use" as a purpose checkbox alongside "Coordination of care" and "Insurance/Legal." This acknowledges patient self-access as a valid use case, but the patient still must navigate a form structured around bilateral information exchange rather than simple record retrieval. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal–based records request option visible on the website.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately returned direct links to the English ROI form, and the organization's Patient Forms page (https://virginiagarcia.org/get-care/patient-forms/) has a clearly labeled "Release of Information Forms" section grouping all four documents. The only friction points were technical: PDF links are embedded in Divi theme JavaScript click handlers rather than standard HTML anchor tags, and the initial Spanish PDF URL found via search returned an error page (the working URL differed by one character in the filename). Neither issue would meaningfully impede a typical patient clicking through the website.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English ROI form (form-1) is a **well-constructed, fillable interactive PDF** — a 2-page document with 54 interactive form fields, a full text layer, and clean digital typography. It was clearly born-digital, not a scan. The form follows a logical structure: patient identification → direction of release → recipient details → purpose and frequency → granular record type selection (9+ categories plus 4 sensitive-information opt-ins) → legal disclosures → signature block → staff-only section.

The language is mostly **plain and accessible**. The rights section clearly states patients don't need to sign to receive treatment, provides a 30-day processing timeline, and offers two concrete revocation pathways. One minor grammatical error exists ("If have not received your records" — missing "you").

A notable accessibility gap: all 54 fillable fields **lack accessible names** (`fillable_field_names: []`), meaning screen readers cannot identify what each field is for. This is a significant deficiency for an otherwise well-designed digital form.

## Barriers and Compliance

VGMHC imposes **no illegitimate barriers**. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, no witness signature needed, and no fees mentioned. The form header provides both a fax number (503-357-4371) and a PO Box address, enabling remote submission. The 30-day processing commitment aligns with HIPAA requirements.

One concern is the **open-ended authorization duration** — the form defaults to remaining in effect "until my care ends with Virginia Garcia," which could mean years or decades for a patient in an ongoing care relationship. While the patient can specify a different date, the default is unusually long compared to typical 1-year expirations.

The form does not explicitly cite the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or frame patient record requests as a distinct legal entitlement — it treats all authorization types equivalently under a general HIPAA authorization framework.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both the main ROI form and the verbal release form are available in full English and Spanish versions — not bilingual addenda, but complete standalone translations. For an FQHC serving a predominantly Spanish-speaking community, this is a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Granular record selection**: Patients can choose specific record types (progress notes with date range, immunizations, labs, dental, medications, imaging, consultations) rather than an all-or-nothing approach, with separate opt-ins for sensitive categories.
- **Active document governance**: Version numbering (v6), effective/revision dates, and department ownership (Compliance) demonstrate ongoing form maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Virginia Garcia earns a solid **B grade**. The organization makes its forms easy to find, provides a technically capable fillable PDF, offers meaningful bilingual access, and imposes no illegitimate barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway — a patient requesting their own records must navigate a generic authorization form designed for third-party releases. The form accommodates patient access (via the "For my own use" checkbox) but doesn't prioritize it. For an independent FQHC without portal infrastructure, this is a common pattern, and VGMHC handles it better than many peers thanks to its well-designed form documents and strong language accessibility.

# Springhill Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms & Pathways

Springhill Medical Center provides two downloadable documents from its Medical Records page: a single-page "Request for Release of Health Information" authorization form (form-1.pdf) and a generic ONC patient rights infographic (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is an actionable authorization form. The organization's Medical Records page also links to a **Zoho-based online ROI request portal** operated by MedRecs Management, and mentions a patient portal. The HIM department accepts fax submissions at 251.410.4014.

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

Springhill does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole authorization form uses a generic structure — "I hereby authorize ___ to release the following information to ___" — designed for third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in the hospital as the source and themselves as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that individual access requests have different legal requirements than third-party authorizations. The Zoho portal may offer a more tailored digital workflow, but the downloadable form funnels all requesters through a single generic pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A simple web search returned the PDF directly, and the organization's Medical Records page clearly links to both the form and the Zoho portal. No bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. However, the form URL embeds "2011-Version-1" in the filename, raising immediate questions about currency.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** — no interactive fields, no clickable checkboxes, just underscore blanks and bracket-style checkboxes requiring print-and-handwrite completion. At one page, the length is reasonable, and the logical flow (demographics → authorization → record types → delivery method → legal language → signature) is sound. However, the form is visually dated and dense, cramming all content onto a single page with small text. The language is a mix of functional and legal — mostly accessible but with a dense legal block at the bottom covering revocability, sensitive information categories, and redisclosure warnings.

The form requests approximately 20–25 fields including patient demographics, record type selections, delivery method details, and signatures. Notably, it asks for the patient's **Social Security Number**, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates a significant privacy risk.

## Barriers & Concerns

Several barriers stand out:

- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers for a medical records request creates unnecessary privacy risk, especially for forms submitted via fax or email.
- **Witness signature line**: The form includes a "Signature of Witness" field, implying a witness may be required — an unnecessary barrier with no HIPAA basis for patient-initiated requests.
- **Sensitive information bundling**: Substance abuse, psychiatric, STD, and HIV/AIDS records are bundled into the general authorization without separate opt-in, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2.
- **Outdated references**: The form still uses the legacy name "Springhill Memorial Hospital" and references "UB-92" (replaced by UB-04 in 2007), signaling a form that has not been updated in over a decade.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods**: The 2011-era form offers five delivery options — pick-up, mail, fax, patient portal, and email — which was forward-looking for its time.
- **Online portal availability**: The Zoho-based electronic request portal provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.
- **Patient rights education**: Hosting the ONC patient rights infographic shows awareness of patient access rights, even if the resource is generic.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: The form explicitly states that treatment and payment cannot be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Springhill Medical Center provides a functional but dated pathway for records access. The form is easy to find and offers multiple submission methods including fax and email, but the authorization form itself is a 15-year-old, non-fillable generic release form that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party disclosure. The SSN requirement and witness signature line create unnecessary barriers. The existence of a Zoho-based online portal is a meaningful positive, offering patients a digital alternative — though the downloadable form itself reflects a process that has not been meaningfully updated since 2011. A patient can get their records through this organization, but the experience requires navigating a form not designed for them.

# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Providence St. Vincent Medical Center does not publish facility-specific ROI forms. All record request forms are managed at the parent system level by Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), a major nonprofit health system spanning seven states. Three overlapping forms were found on the Providence HIM page:

1. **Form-1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" (ORC 240A, rev. 03/20): A general-purpose ROI authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Includes a "Self" checkbox but is framed around disclosure to others.
2. **Form-2** — "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" (940507, dated 3/27/25): A dedicated patient access form with updated PSJH branding and R1RCM vendor contact info. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
3. **Form-3** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" (rev. 03/20): An older OR/MT-specific patient access form that form-2 appears to supersede, with outdated PH&S branding and contact information.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence meaningfully distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Form-2 is explicitly titled as a "Patient Request to Access" and defaults to disclosure "to Myself" as the first option. This is a genuine dedicated patient access form — not a generic authorization repurposed with a self-access checkbox. However, the general authorization (form-1) is more easily found via web search, meaning a patient may encounter the less appropriate form first. The HIM page does not clearly guide patients toward form-2 over form-1.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required pivoting from the facility name to the parent system. A search for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center" did not surface ROI forms directly — searchers had to navigate to the system-level HIM page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management`. Once found, this page is comprehensive, listing multiple forms with instructions. However, the presence of three overlapping forms with no clear guidance on which is current creates confusion. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2, the primary patient access form, is a well-constructed digital document. At 3 pages and 72 fillable fields, it is genuinely interactive — patients can complete nearly every field digitally before printing for signature. The layout uses clearly labeled sections (patient information, use and disclosure, record type selection, rights statement, signature) with capitalized headers. Record type options are helpfully tiered: "Pertinent information" (with an explanatory list of common record types) versus "All/Entire Medical Record," plus an "Other" field and "Last two years only" option.

The language is mostly clear, though the title uses the HIPAA term "Designated Record Set" rather than plain-language alternatives. The opening warning — "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — is somewhat intimidating without clarifying which fields are required versus optional.

Five delivery options are offered: MyChart, Paper (Mailed), CD (Mailed), FAX, and Email. Including MyChart is a notable patient-friendly touch. Submission can be made by mail, email (ROIHIMreception@r1rcm.com), or fax — no in-person visit is required.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable barrier is the wet-signature requirement on forms 1 and 3, though form-2 may accept electronic signatures (it lacks the explicit "Print form and sign by hand" instruction found on the others). Fees are disclosed vaguely — "there may be a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access.

A potential red flag appears in form-2's internal "HOSPITAL USE ONLY" section, which includes a physician approval/denial workflow for record release. Under HIPAA § 164.524, denial of patient access is permitted only in narrow circumstances; a blanket physician-approval gate could constitute an unreasonable barrier if applied broadly.

The continued publication of the outdated form-3 alongside form-2, with different contact information and organizational branding, risks sending patients to non-functional channels.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from general third-party authorization
- **72 fillable interactive fields** on the primary form — genuinely digital-first design
- **Five delivery format options** including MyChart and email
- **Multilingual language assistance notices** in English, Spanish, and Chinese
- **Multiple submission channels** (mail, email, fax) with no in-person requirement
- **Comprehensive HIM page** with centralized ROI processing

## Overall Assessment

Providence St. Vincent, through its parent system, provides an above-average patient record request experience. The existence of a dedicated patient access form with strong digital fillability and multiple delivery options demonstrates genuine attention to patient needs. The main weaknesses are findability (requiring navigation from facility to system-level resources), form proliferation without clear versioning guidance, vague fee disclosures, and the physician-approval gate embedded in form-2's workflow. A patient who finds form-2 will have a good experience; the challenge is ensuring they find it.

# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Newton-Wellesley Hospital (NWH) is a community hospital in Newton, MA, part of the Mass General Brigham (MGB) health system (formerly Partners HealthCare). For medical records requests, NWH uses the system-wide MGB authorization form rather than a facility-specific document. Two forms were found: the current MGB-branded authorization (form-1, dated 06/2024) and a legacy Partners HealthCare version (form-2, dated 01/2006) that remains accessible at an orphaned URL on nwh.org but is no longer linked from current navigation.

## Access Pathway

NWH does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary (and only current) form is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" designed to serve all release scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, and other recipients. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as someone authorizing release to a third party, selecting "Personal" as the purpose and checking a box to have records mailed to their own address. While functional, this approach requires patients to identify which sections apply to them and which to skip, without explicit guidance distinguishing patient access rights from third-party authorization.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. It frames the interaction as an "authorization" rather than a right, which is technically appropriate for third-party releases but conceptually misaligned for patient self-access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The NWH website provides a clear navigable path (Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records), though this redirects to the MGB parent system's medical records page where the user must expand a "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" accordion to access the download. This extra indirection is minor. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1) is a high-quality digital artifact. It features **78 fillable/interactive form fields** — checkboxes, text inputs, and date fields are all functional for on-screen completion. The form is organized into five clearly lettered sections (A through E) with a logical flow: patient info → permission/purpose → record types → sensitive information → understanding/signature. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The header prominently displays submission instructions (mailing address and fax number), and the form offers four delivery methods for the records themselves: Patient Gateway (portal), Secure Email, Fax, and Paper Copy via Mail. The inclusion of electronic delivery options is a notable strength.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though Section D (sensitive information authorization) contains dense regulatory text, particularly the 42 CFR Part 2 disclosure. This is legally required but not reader-friendly.

**Multilingual support** is a bright spot: the MGB medical records page offers the form in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

## Barriers

**Notarization**: Not required. Only a patient signature is needed.

**Fees**: The form subtly differentiates — copying fees are asterisked only for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes, while "Personal" and "Medical Care" are not marked, implying no fees for patient access requests. However, this is implicit rather than explicitly stated.

**Date requirement**: Section C states patients "MUST specify dates" (capitalized emphasis) for each record type category. HIPAA does not require patients to specify date ranges, and this requirement could function as a barrier for patients seeking comprehensive access to their records.

**Outside records carve-out**: Records from outside providers held by MGB will not be released unless the patient specifically requests them under "Other" — placing a knowledge burden on patients who may not know what outside records exist in their file.

## Strengths

- 78 fillable form fields enabling genuine digital completion
- Four delivery methods including portal and secure email
- Trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Portuguese)
- Implicit fee exemption for patient access requests
- Clean, well-organized layout with clear section headers
- Easy findability via web search or website navigation

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway; generic third-party authorization form only
- "MUST specify dates" requirement potentially exceeds HIPAA requirements
- No explicit statement of patient Right of Access
- Outside records require special knowledge to request
- Submission limited to fax or mail (no online form submission)

## Overall Assessment

Newton-Wellesley Hospital, through its parent system MGB, provides a technically well-executed authorization form that is easy to find and genuinely usable digitally. The form's 78 fillable fields, multilingual availability, and multiple delivery options represent above-average document quality. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, funneling all requestors through a generic authorization form. The "MUST specify dates" requirement and lack of Right of Access framing are missed opportunities to center the patient experience. Overall, this is a competent but generic approach — the form works, but it wasn't designed with the patient requesting their own records as the primary audience.

# Canton-Potsdam Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Canton-Potsdam Hospital (CPH) is a community hospital in Potsdam, NY, operated as part of St. Lawrence Health System (SLH), which was acquired by Rochester Regional Health (RRH). Three documents were retrieved — all from the Wayback Machine, as no forms remain on any live website. The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, a blank New York State OCA Official Form No. 960 ("Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA"). The other two documents are a COVID-specific pre-filled version of the same form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Canton-Potsdam Hospital does **not** offer a differentiated pathway for patient self-access. The only authorization form the organization ever published online was the generic NY State OCA-960, which is designed for third-party release of information — not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. A patient requesting their own records would use the same form as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer, needing to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission tool.

Critically, the parent system's Swellbox/Datavant online records request tool **explicitly excludes** St. Lawrence Health facilities, stating: "St. Lawrence Health is not currently available through this application, for information on requesting these records call (315) 769-4386." This leaves phone as the only visible pathway for patients today.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any form for this organization was extremely difficult. The original SLH website (stlawrencehealthsystem.org) now redirects to rochesterregional.org, where CPH-specific content has not been migrated. Multiple web searches returned no downloadable forms. The only successful strategy was the Wayback Machine CDX API, which identified archived PDFs from the defunct SLH domain. A typical patient would have no realistic way to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2.pdf, blank OCA-960) is a digitally produced PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. Its text layer is severely garbled due to font encoding issues, rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers, search, or copy-paste. Despite being created digitally (via PScript5.dll/Acrobat Distiller), no interactive fields were added, requiring patients to print and handwrite responses.

The form is 2 pages: page 1 is the authorization itself with 13 numbered items; page 2 provides instructions. The structure is logical and reasonably organized, covering patient identification, record scope, recipients, purpose, expiration, and signature. However, the language is formal and legalistic, and the form is not pre-populated with any CPH or SLH contact information — patients must know and fill in the correct provider name and HIM department address themselves.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form includes appropriate compliance elements: explicit voluntariness statement, non-conditioning language, right to revoke in writing, and separate initialing for sensitive categories (HIV, substance abuse, mental health) per NY State law. However, the form header includes a Social Security Number field, which creates unnecessary identity theft risk and is not required by HIPAA. No fees are mentioned on the authorization form itself, though the NPP (form-3) does include HIPAA-compliant fee language limiting electronic copy costs to direct labor.

The form does not specify submission methods, delivery format options, or response timelines. No electronic delivery options are mentioned.

## Notable Strengths

- Uses the standardized NY State OCA-960, ensuring baseline legal compliance
- NPP clearly articulates electronic access rights and EHR-based record availability
- Patient-controlled authorization expiration (by date or event)
- Appropriate sensitive-information opt-in with separate initialing requirements

## Notable Weaknesses

- No ROI form available on any live website; patients must call to initiate requests
- Parent system's online records tool explicitly excludes this facility
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party authorization
- Form has zero fillable fields and a garbled, inaccessible text layer
- SSN field on authorization form creates unnecessary risk
- Organization appears stuck in a transitional state between SLH and RRH infrastructure

## Overall Assessment

Canton-Potsdam Hospital presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in this study. The combination of unfindable forms, a phone-only current pathway, no dedicated patient access process, and technically deficient documents creates substantial barriers for patients seeking their own records. The organizational transition from St. Lawrence Health to Rochester Regional Health has left patients in a gap — excluded from the parent system's digital tools but with no local alternative. A patient today would need to call, navigate an uncertain process, and likely complete a paper form designed for third-party release rather than individual access.

# Broward Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Broward Health, a government-owned regional health system in Fort Lauderdale, FL, offers a single general-purpose ROI authorization form ("Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Information") in four languages: English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese. The organization also provides an online records request wizard via Swellbox, a third-party vendor. The system operates multiple facilities (Medical Center, North, Coral Springs, Imperial Point, East Imaging Center, Weston), all sharing the same form and process.

## Access Pathway

Broward Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ROI form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both purposes, with a "MYSELF" checkbox alongside an "OTHER" option for third-party recipients. While this checkbox makes it possible for patients to request their own records, the form was not designed around the patient access use case — it requires a purpose statement (not required under HIPAA § 164.524 for patient access), applies minimum necessary language to all requests (which should not apply to individual access under 45 CFR § 164.502(b)(2)(v)), and includes a witness signature line that creates unnecessary procedural friction.

The Swellbox online wizard at `swellbox.com/broward-health-wizard.html` offers a potentially better digital pathway, though the PDF form appears to be the primary resource offered on the Medical Records Request page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The Medical Records Request page is reachable in approximately 3 clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Information Request → Medical Records Request) and is well-organized, listing all four language versions with direct download links plus the Swellbox option. However, **Cloudflare bot protection** blocked all direct `curl` download attempts, requiring browser-based retrieval. The English form URL was also case-sensitive, with the lowercase variant linked on the page failing — a subtle but real broken link.

## Form Document Quality

The form quality is a mixed picture. On the positive side, the form is a concise single page with a logical section flow: sensitive record classification, patient demographics, authorization and recipient designation, delivery method, purpose, date range, detailed record type checklist (~15 categories with date ranges for lab and radiology), patient rights disclosures, and signatures.

On the negative side, the **English version (form-1.pdf) is an image-only scan** — a grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no screen reader accessibility. This is the primary language version yet the worst quality artifact. The Spanish, Creole, and Portuguese versions are digitally created PDFs with text layers, but they too have **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The Spanish and Portuguese versions also have garbled text from font encoding errors in their expiration clauses. The form's footer references "ADDRESSOGRAPH" and carbon-copy routing ("WHITE - MEDICAL RECORD / CANARY - PATIENTS"), confirming its origin as a physical paper form from 2014 that has never been modernized.

Delivery options are limited to paper or **encrypted CD** — an anachronistic option in 2026 with no email, portal, or electronic transfer available through the form itself.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form includes a **witness signature line**, which is not required by HIPAA for patient access requests and could prevent patients from completing the form at home. A Broward Health authorized signature line is also present, suggesting the form may have been designed for in-person processing. No notarization is required. Fees are referenced vaguely ("reasonable charge" per CFR 164.524) without specific amounts. The website notes approximately 3 business days for processing. Fax submission is available at facility-specific numbers, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Exceptional multilingual support**: Offering the ROI form in four languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese) reflects genuine attention to South Florida's linguistic diversity and is rare among U.S. healthcare organizations.
- **Swellbox online portal**: Provides a fully digital alternative pathway for patients who cannot or prefer not to use the PDF.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 citation**: References the HIPAA Right of Access regulation directly in patient rights disclosures.
- **Granular record type selection**: The detailed checklist with date-range filtering gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.

## Overall Assessment

Broward Health demonstrates genuine effort in accessibility through multilingual forms and an online portal alternative, but the underlying form infrastructure is outdated and not patient-access-oriented. The 2014-era generic ROI authorization, image-only English scan, lack of fillable fields, witness requirement, and inappropriate application of minimum necessary language to patient requests all reflect an organization that has not modernized its records request process to match the spirit of HIPAA's individual access rights. The Swellbox portal partially redeems the experience, but the PDF pathway — which remains prominently offered — falls short of modern standards. **Grade: C.**

# Piedmont Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Piedmont Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Rock Hill, SC, affiliated with Tenet Healthcare. Two authorization forms were found: a one-page hospital-specific form (form-1) and a two-page physician network form (form-2). The organization also contracts with Datavant and offers Swellbox online portals for both patient and provider record requests, which represents the most patient-friendly pathway.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The hospital's "Request Medical Records" page at piedmontmedicalcenter.com/patients/request-medical-records serves as the central hub, linking to: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (form-1), and (2) a Swellbox/Datavant online portal for patient record requests. A second PDF form (form-2) exists on the affiliated Piedmont Physician Network website but is not linked from the hospital's main medical records page.

Form-1 is the primary PDF document for hospital record requests. It is a single-page "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" form (EZ-7003, revised 2013). The Swellbox portal, however, is likely the pathway the organization most actively directs patients toward for digital submission.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither PDF form is a dedicated patient-access form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 does include a "Self" checkbox under the PURPOSE section, acknowledging that a patient may be requesting their own records, but the form's framing ("I authorize Piedmont Medical Center to disclose the following information...") and structure assume a third-party recipient scenario. Form-2 is even more clearly a third-party release form, with fields for "Name of Person or Class of Persons who may disclose" and "To release records to" — a structure that makes no sense for self-access.

The Swellbox portal provides a meaningful alternative. By offering separate portals for patient and provider requests, the organization does create some differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — though this differentiation exists at the portal level, not in the PDF forms themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately returned the medical records page URL and direct PDF links. The medical records page is well-organized and clearly labeled. The only technical hurdle was Cloudflare bot protection blocking automated downloads, requiring browser-based retrieval — a hosting infrastructure issue that could also affect assistive technologies.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1** (primary hospital form) is a non-fillable PDF with zero interactive fields. Despite having labeled fields for patient name, date of birth, address, and various checkboxes for record types, all are static text requiring print-and-fill completion. The form is compact at one page with a logical layout organized into PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION REQUESTED, PURPOSE, and INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO sections. Record type options are granular, with 14+ checkboxes covering specific document types plus a write-in option.

The language is moderately legalistic, particularly the liability release and re-disclosure clauses. Template merge fields (`«PatientNumberBarcode»`, `«PatientName»`, etc.) are visible at the bottom of the public PDF, indicating an unprocessed template extracted from the hospital's document management system — confusing for patients and unprofessional in appearance. A typo ("in ability" for "inability") in the legal representative attestation is concerning for a legal document.

**Form-2** (physician network form) is more comprehensive at two pages but also entirely non-fillable. Its standout feature is granular opt-in checkboxes for seven categories of highly confidential information (mental health, psychotherapy notes, HIV/AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, sexual assault, child abuse/neglect). However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, carries no organizational branding, has a date field locked to "200_" (rendering one term option unusable since 2010), and provides no Privacy Office contact information.

## Barriers and Compliance

Neither form requires notarization or in-person submission. Neither mentions fees. Both include standard HIPAA disclosures: revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warnings. Form-1's six-month default expiration is reasonable. The liability release clause on Form-1 — releasing the hospital "from any legal responsibility or liability" — is unnecessary for patient self-access and could discourage patients from exercising their rights. Both forms are notably outdated (2013 and pre-2010 respectively), predating significant regulatory updates.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** for patient record requests provides a modern digital pathway beyond the paper forms
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear organization and multiple access options
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** (14+ options on form-1) give patients meaningful control
- **Granular sensitive information opt-in** on form-2 (seven separate categories) represents strong practice

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — both PDFs are generic third-party authorization forms
- **Zero fillable fields** on either form — entirely print-and-fill
- **Severely outdated forms** (one from 2013, one from pre-2010)
- **Visible template merge fields** on form-1 indicate an unprocessed internal template
- **SSN requested** on form-2 (unnecessary privacy risk)
- **Liability release clause** on form-1 (inappropriate for patient self-access)

## Overall Assessment

Piedmont Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional patient records request experience. The organization's investment in a Swellbox/Datavant online portal significantly improves the digital pathway, compensating for PDF forms that are entirely paper-oriented and outdated. The medical records page is easy to find and well-organized. However, the underlying PDF forms show their age — neither has been updated in over a decade, neither offers fillable fields, and neither is designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. The organization earns a B grade, buoyed by the portal alternative and reasonable findability, but held back by paper-era form design and a generic authorization approach that doesn't center patient access rights.

# Prevea Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Prevea Health is an independent nonprofit physician practice based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It offers a single authorization form — an "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (PRV_839, rev. 0118) — as its primary mechanism for patients to request their own medical records. The same form is available in four languages: English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. No separate patient access–specific form or online portal was identified.

## Access Pathway

Prevea Health uses a **generic HIPAA authorization form** rather than a dedicated patient access form. However, the form explicitly accommodates patient self-requests: Section 3 ("To Disclose To") includes a "Self" checkbox with delivery options (pick up, mail, on-site viewing, electronic format, and email with encrypted/unencrypted options). Section 7 ("Purpose") includes "Patient Request" as a named checkbox option. While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, the form clearly signals that patients can use it for their own records — placing it above average among generic authorization forms.

The form does not differentiate the legal basis for patient self-access (HIPAA § 164.524) from third-party release (§ 164.508), but the practical workflow is reasonably clear for a patient who wants their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and the form is directly linked from the Patient Forms and Documents > Medical Records page at prevea.com. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was encountered. The URL is descriptive. This is a model for how organizations should make forms accessible.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally-created PDF** — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. A patient must print and hand-fill the form (or annotate it in a PDF viewer). This is the form's most significant technical limitation. The layout is logically organized into nine numbered sections with clear headings, and the single-page format keeps things concise. However, the density required to fit everything onto one page makes the rights section (Section 8) extremely cramped and difficult to read.

Section 8 is the form's weakest content area: a ~200-word paragraph of dense legalese with complex nested clauses that would challenge most patients. The rest of the form uses reasonably plain language with clearly labeled fields and checkbox options.

The form provides granular record-type selection (12 categories plus a free-text field) and includes opt-out checkboxes for sensitive information (alcohol/drug abuse, HIV results, mental health) consistent with Wisconsin law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Barriers

- **No notarization required.** Witness signature is needed only for AODA/Mental Health disclosures, consistent with legal requirements.
- **Fees:** The form states "copy fees may apply" but does not disclose specific amounts — neutral but not fully transparent.
- **Date range default:** If left blank, only records from the past two years are disclosed. This restrictive default is a notable red flag — patients seeking complete records must affirmatively specify a date range, which is unintuitive.
- **Submission instructions absent:** The form provides no guidance on where or how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, mailing address, or email for the HIM department. A patient who downloads and completes the form has no clear next step.
- **Minor errors:** "42 CRF" (should be CFR) and "e-email" (doubled prefix) suggest limited quality review.
- **HSHS references:** The form references "HSHS" (Hospital Sisters Health System) without explanation, which may confuse patients who know only Prevea Health.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — rare among physician practices and reflective of local demographics.
- **Five delivery options** including electronic format and email with encrypted/unencrypted distinction — well above average.
- **Explicit self-request pathway** via the "Self" checkbox and "Patient Request" purpose option.

## Overall Assessment

Prevea Health provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience with genuine accessibility strengths (multilingual forms, electronic delivery options, easy findability). The primary weaknesses are the non-fillable PDF format, missing submission instructions, a restrictive date range default, and dense legalese in the rights section. The form serves patients adequately but falls short of best-in-class due to its paper-oriented workflow and the absence of submission guidance.

# Garfield Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Garfield Medical Center (GMC), a for-profit community hospital in Monterey Park, CA, operated by AHMC Healthcare Inc., provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URL paths on the AHMC website. Neither form is specifically designed for patient self-access; both are general-purpose "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" documents that serve third-party release and personal use alike.

## Access Pathway

GMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient requesting their own records must use the same authorization form designed for release to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. The form includes "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox, and a patient could fill in their own name in the "Release To" field, but the framing is clearly oriented toward third-party disclosure ("I authorize Garfield Medical Center to Release Medical records to: Person/Organization"). There is no online portal, no digital request wizard, and no separate patient access request form.

That said, the form does include an "Inspect or Review Medical Record" option alongside copies, acknowledging the patient's right to review records in person — a positive touch that many facilities omit.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, login requirements, or browser workarounds needed. Both form versions were indexed and accessible via descriptive URLs. The only minor confusion is that two near-identical forms exist at different paths (`/gmc/documents/` and `/gmc/docs/`), both marked "Revised 9/21." A patient discovering both would have no clear way to determine which is authoritative.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — **not** a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand despite its digital origin. This is a significant missed opportunity: the form was clearly authored in a word processor but exported without interactive fields.

The layout is well-organized, following a logical flow: Patient Information → Release To → Purpose → Information to Be Released → Delivery Instructions → Notice of Rights → Term → Signature. Section headers are clear and distinct. The form offers impressive granularity in record type selection (12+ specific categories plus "ALL RECORDS") and provides multiple delivery options including email with a dedicated address field.

Language is generally accessible, using an "I understand that..." format for patient rights. However, legal references to California Health and Safety Code sections are included without plain-language explanation. The opening line — "Failure to provide all information may invalidate this authorization" — sets an intimidating tone, and it is unclear which fields are truly mandatory.

## Barriers & Concerns

- **CD liability waiver bundled into authorization:** All patients must waive liability for CD release as part of signing the form, even when not requesting imaging on CD. This is consent bundling.
- **Fees disclosed without amounts:** The form references California fee statutes but provides no specific costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate expenses.
- **Revocation limited to postal mail:** Revoking authorization requires a signed letter mailed to the Privacy Officer — no fax, email, or in-person option.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive absence.
- **Submission methods:** The form lists fax (626-307-2186), mail, email, pick-up, and hand delivery. Fax and email availability mean a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery option** with a dedicated field — uncommon among ROI forms.
- **"Inspect or Review" checkbox** alongside copies — acknowledges the HIPAA right to review.
- **Granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control.
- **Clear treatment non-conditionality statement** and 180-day expiration with patient override.

## Overall Assessment

Garfield Medical Center provides a reasonably well-structured authorization form that is easy to find and offers useful features like email delivery and record type granularity. However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form, lacking fillable fields, and bundling a CD liability waiver. The absence of a dedicated patient access pathway and the non-fillable PDF format are the most significant gaps. The facility meets the baseline for electronic submission (fax and email are available) but offers no modern digital workflow.

# East Georgia Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

East Georgia Healthcare Center (EGHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Swainsboro, Georgia. Three documents were found on its website: an English-language Medical Records Release form (form-1), a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The critical finding is that **none of these documents serve a patient requesting their own records from EGHC**. Both release forms are designed exclusively for incoming records — authorizing other providers to send records *to* EGHC — with EGHC's own address hardcoded as the destination.

## Access Pathway: The Wrong Form Problem

EGHC exemplifies the "wrong form" problem identified in this study. The Medical Records Release form's key language reads: *"I hereby request copies of all records pertaining to my health history and medical care released to: EAST GEORGIA HEALTHCARE CENTER, 215 NORTH COLEMAN STREET, SWAINSBORO, GA 30401."* The "Requesting medical records from" field is where the patient fills in their *previous* provider. A patient trying to exercise their HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) to obtain records *from* EGHC would find no applicable form anywhere on the website.

The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — it simply does not address patient self-access at all. The Notice of Privacy Practices mentions the right to "inspect and copy medical information" but provides no actionable instructions, no form reference, and no guidance on how to actually submit a request. A patient would likely need to call the Privacy Officer or visit in person, with no written process to guide them.

## Retrieval Experience

The forms page at https://eghc.org/forms/ is findable within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via site navigation. However, the forms are hosted on RightSignature, a third-party e-signature platform, which requires entering a name and email before viewing the form content. Old direct PDF links (from 2019) now return 404 errors but still appear in search engine results, creating confusing dead ends. The retrieval required moderate effort: the forms page was located without difficulty, but extracting the actual form content from RightSignature required technical workarounds (extracting the S3-hosted PNG image and converting to PDF).

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page document with clean layout and clear visual hierarchy: letterhead at top, patient identification fields, destination address, source provider field, a granular 17-option record type checklist, release duration options, legal disclaimer, and signature block. Via the RightSignature platform, the form is interactive with fillable fields and e-signature capability — a meaningful step toward digital-first form handling. However, the standalone captured PDF is image-only with no text layer, no fillable fields, and is completely inaccessible to screen readers.

The language is moderately accessible — the legal disclaimer covers standard HIPAA authorization elements (revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, non-conditioning) without being impenetrably dense. The form collects approximately 10 fields, which is reasonable in scope. However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, which creates unnecessary data exposure risk given that name, date of birth, and address are already collected.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No patient access form**: The most significant barrier — a patient has no written pathway to request their own records.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers on a form designed for fax/mail transmission is an unnecessary privacy risk.
- **Missing authorization expiration**: The form lacks an explicit expiration date, a required element under 45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(v).
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees for record copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form text gives no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **RightSignature viewing barrier**: Patients must provide name and email before even viewing the form content.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Both English and Spanish versions of the release form are offered — appropriate for an FQHC serving a diverse community in south-central Georgia.
- **RightSignature e-signature**: Electronic completion and submission capability is a genuine digital-first investment, even if applied to the wrong form.
- **Granular record type selection**: The 17-category checklist with an "Other" option gives patients meaningful control over what information is released.
- **Title X confidentiality**: The NPP includes thoughtful language about Title X Family Planning Program confidentiality.

## Overall Assessment

EGHC has invested in some positive infrastructure — bilingual forms, an e-signature platform, and a navigable forms page — but these investments are undermined by a fundamental gap: the organization provides no form or pathway for patients to request their own records. The only ROI-related forms are designed for incoming records from other providers. A patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access would find their rights acknowledged in the NPP but no actionable way to exercise them online. This represents a significant patient-centeredness failure that overshadows the form's otherwise reasonable document quality.

# Mankato Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mankato Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Mankato, Minnesota. Two PDF forms were found — both versions of the same "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" document (form MC032). Form-1 (revised 02/23) is the current version; form-2 (revised 07/20) is a superseded version that remains publicly accessible. The clinic also offers an online medical record request tool and accepts submissions via fax, email, and DocuSign, providing patients with multiple channels beyond the PDF form itself.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Mankato Clinic does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. Both forms use a generic two-party structure — "Release my medical records from" (source) and "Share my medical records with" (destination) — requiring a patient who wants their own records to awkwardly list Mankato Clinic as the source and themselves as the destination. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no indication that patients have a legal right to obtain their records. The form is framed entirely as a release/disclosure authorization.

That said, the clinic does offer an **online medical record request tool** at a separate URL, which may provide a more streamlined patient self-access experience. The ROI page also notes that DocuSign is accepted, and patients can submit signed authorizations by fax (507-388-1878) or email (ROI@mankatoclinic.com). This gives patients practical electronic submission options even though the PDF form itself is print-oriented.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced direct PDF links and the dedicated Release of Information page at `mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/`. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The ROI page provides clear contact information and links to both the PDF form and the online request tool. One minor concern: both the current and superseded form versions remain live with no redirect or deprecation notice, which could confuse patients.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — page 1 is the authorization, page 2 is a full page of field-by-field instructions. Despite being natively digital, the form has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, handwrite, and return via fax or mail. The policy that "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized" reinforces the print-and-sign workflow.

The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → source → destination → record types → reason → signature. Section headers use bolded questions ("WHO HAS INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE RELEASED?") with sidebar labels, creating a clear visual hierarchy. The form-1 revision improved readability by replacing clinical labels ("Health Care Facility / Provider") with plain language ("Release my medical records from"). The 11 record-type checkboxes cover a reasonable range including sensitive categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health/substance abuse). The instruction page is a genuine bright spot — section-by-section guidance that is uncommon and practically useful.

The form is English-only. Field count is moderate (approximately 20 fields including patient demographics, source/destination addresses, checkboxes, and signature). The legal boilerplate is clear and reasonably concise.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **Fees**: Vaguely disclosed — "I understand there may be a charge" with no amounts or schedule. Patients cannot anticipate costs before submitting.
- **Turnaround**: 7–10 business days stated, well within HIPAA's 30-day window.
- **Witness line**: The older form-2 includes a "Witnessed by" line (removed in form-1), which could have been perceived as a barrier.
- **Delivery options**: The form lists physical delivery methods only (given, mailed, faxed, pick up). The older form-2 instructions explicitly state "Medical records are not able to be emailed." No electronic delivery option appears on either form.
- **Authorization expiration**: 12 months with written revocation — standard and compliant.
- **Treatment conditioning**: Properly disclosed with HIPAA-compliant exceptions.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated instruction page** with practical guidance ("We prioritize requests by appointment date")
- **Multiple ROI contact points** — three offices with dedicated phone/fax, plus email
- **Accepts any HIPAA-compliant form**, including the Minnesota Standard Consent Form
- **Online request tool** available as an alternative to the PDF form
- **Modernized plain-language labels** in the current form version

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable fields on a natively digital PDF — an unnecessary friction point
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release
- Vague fee disclosure with no specific amounts
- No mention of patient rights or HIPAA Right of Access
- Two versions of the same form hosted simultaneously without deprecation notice

## Overall Assessment

Mankato Clinic makes its ROI form easy to find and provides multiple submission channels (fax, email, online tool), which removes the most critical access barriers. The form itself is well-organized with an unusually helpful instruction page. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization framing (no patient access pathway differentiation), and vague fee disclosure keep it from excelling. The organization's practical accommodations — multiple contact points, alternative submission methods, acceptance of any HIPAA-compliant form — partially compensate for the form's design limitations.

# Rio Grande Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rio Grande Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Del Norte, Colorado. It offers a single downloadable PDF ROI form — a generic "Authorization for Release of Information" — used across both the hospital and its affiliated clinic. Importantly, the organization also provides embedded HIPAA-compliant JotForms on both the hospital and clinic patient records pages, giving patients an online submission pathway alongside the traditional PDF.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one PDF form was retrieved: **form-1.pdf**, a one-page "Authorization for Release of Information" created in Microsoft Word 2013 and uploaded in December 2018. The same PDF is linked from both the hospital and clinic records pages. In addition, each page embeds a separate JotForm (hospital JotForm ID: 220685534838162; clinic JotForm ID: 220685679526166) for online submission, providing a digital-first alternative to the downloadable PDF. The "FOR OFFICE USE ONLY" section on the PDF also references fax and mail as delivery methods used by staff.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Rio Grande Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses classic third-party authorization framing — "I authorize ___ to disclose my individually identifiable health information" — requiring the patient to fill in both a "To" and "From" entity. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should list Rio Grande Hospital as the "From" and themselves as the "To," which is workable but unintuitive. The form does include a "Personal Use" purpose checkbox, which is the closest acknowledgment that patients may be requesting records for themselves. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524, and no mention of electronic health information export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Web searches quickly surfaced the hospital's patient records pages, and the PDF had a descriptive URL. The JotForms are prominently featured on the pages, while the downloadable PDF sits in the sidebar — meaning the online pathway is actually more visible than the print form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was required.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable document with zero interactive form fields. Despite being digitally created (not a scan), it uses underscored blank lines for handwriting — a print-era design. At one page, it is appropriately concise. The layout follows a logical sequence (patient identity → parties → record types → HIV authorization → purpose → legal terms → signature), but the opening authorization paragraph is a dense, multi-line sentence covering communicable diseases, mental illness, and redisclosure warnings all at once. Record type options are limited to four checkboxes (History/Physical, Lab Results, X-Ray Reports, Other Diagnostic Reports) with no option for "all records," discharge summaries, medications, or billing. The form opens with "THIS REQUEST MUST BE FILLED OUT COMPLETELY" in emphasized text — a stern tone that could discourage patients uncertain about fields like SSN.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flag is the **SSN collection** — the form requests Social Security Number as a standard identifier alongside name and DOB, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk. The form also provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or reference to the online JotForm. A patient who downloads and fills the PDF has no clear next step. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeframe is stated. The form does not require notarization or a witness.

## Notable Strengths

The standout bright spot is the **online JotForm submission option**. While not part of the PDF itself, the organization provides a fully digital pathway for records requests via embedded web forms on both hospital and clinic pages. This is a meaningful investment in patient accessibility. The form's **non-conditioning language** ("I understand that my health care and the payment of my health care will not be affected if I do not sign this form") is a positive HIPAA compliance element. The **single-page format** keeps things concise. The HIV/STD/AIDS opt-in/opt-out structure with patient initials properly addresses Colorado's heightened protections for sensitive health information.

## Overall Assessment

Rio Grande Hospital provides a functional but dated records request experience. The PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no patient-access differentiation, no fillable fields, an unnecessary SSN field, and no submission instructions. However, the organization partially compensates with its JotForm-based online submission pathway, which gives patients a digital-first alternative. The best available pathway for a patient is the online JotForm, though the PDF form — the only downloadable document — falls short of modern patient-centered design. For a small independent critical access hospital, the investment in online forms is commendable, but the underlying authorization framework remains oriented toward third-party release rather than individual access rights.

# Maury Regional Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Maury Regional Health, a nonprofit regional system based in Columbia, TN (encompassing Maury Regional Medical Center, Marshall Medical Center, Wayne Medical Center, and Maury Regional Medical Group), provides a reasonably accessible records request experience with several notable strengths — particularly multilingual availability and multiple delivery channels — but falls short of best-in-class by relying on a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms were found, both linked from the Medical Records page (`/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/`):

- **Form 1 (Form 131, 08/2018):** English-language "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a single-page, general-purpose ROI form.
- **Form 2 (Form 131S, 05/2017):** Spanish-language translation of the same form, though dated over a year earlier and containing content discrepancies.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, the medical records page also offers an **online request portal via Swellbox** and access through the **My Maury Health Patient Portal**, giving patients three distinct channels. Fax submission (931.380.4092) and phone contact (931.380.4089) are also listed.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Maury Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form serves all purposes — requesting your own records, releasing to an attorney, sending to an insurer, etc. However, the form does accommodate patient access by listing "Myself" as the first option in the recipient field and including "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox. A patient can use this form, but must navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios (specifying a recipient name/address, selecting among purposes that don't apply). The availability of the Swellbox online portal is a meaningful alternative that may provide a more streamlined patient experience, though the portal itself was not evaluated in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A site-scoped search immediately surfaced the medical records page. The page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Medical Records). PDFs are hosted on Cloudinary CDN and downloaded without authentication or bot blocking. The only minor difficulty was a 403 error from the web_fetch tool on the medical records page, requiring browser fallback — but the PDFs themselves downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (Form 131) is a clean, single-page, digitally-created PDF — not a scan. It has a proper text layer enabling screen reader access and text search. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring handwriting after printing. The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (demographics → direction of release → purpose → date range → record types → format → consent → signature) and uses reasonable visual hierarchy with checkboxes and section groupings. Language is a blend of plain English and necessary legal terminology — the consent bullets are clearly written, though the sensitive information disclosure section is dense.

The form offers an unusually good set of **four delivery format options**: paper copies, CD, USB flash drive, and encrypted email — with a thoughtful security disclosure about email risks.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required.**
- **No fees disclosed** — the form says nothing about costs.
- **Hold harmless clause** is a red flag: "The facility is hereby released and discharged of any liability, and I will hold the facility harmless for complying with this authorization." HIPAA does not permit conditioning access on signing a liability release.
- **90-day authorization expiration** is relatively short but within norms.
- **Photo ID verification** on the English form implies in-person submission, though the website lists fax as an option.
- **No response time commitment** stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — uncommon among community hospitals in this study.
- **Multiple request channels** (PDF, Swellbox portal, patient portal, fax, phone).
- **Encrypted email delivery** option with proactive security disclosure.
- **"Myself" listed first** in the recipient field — a subtle but meaningful patient-centric design choice.

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must use a generic authorization form.
- **Non-fillable PDF** — requires printing and handwriting.
- **Spanish form is outdated** (05/2017 vs. 08/2018 English) with missing content (no Social Security/Disability purpose, no Photo ID section).
- **Hold harmless clause** is potentially noncompliant for patient access requests.
- **Sensitive information limitation** is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to exercise it.

## Overall Assessment

Maury Regional Health provides an accessible, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process with commendable multilingual support and multiple submission channels. The main shortcomings are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, a non-fillable PDF form, and a potentially problematic liability waiver. The availability of the Swellbox online portal partially compensates for the PDF's limitations, and the overall experience is adequate — a patient can successfully request their own records without undue difficulty, though the process could be more patient-centric.

# Cherokee Health Systems (River Valley Health) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cherokee Health Systems, now rebranded as **River Valley Health**, is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The organization provides a well-organized suite of four PDF documents for medical records requests, available on a dedicated Medical Records page at rvh.org. The suite consists of the primary English ROI authorization form, a Spanish translation, and color-coded instructional guides in both languages — a standout accessibility feature that few organizations match.

## Forms and Pathways

All four documents are variants of a single general-purpose **"Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Health Records"** form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form distinct from the third-party release authorization. The form is bidirectional — it can be used to request records from an external provider or to authorize River Valley Health to send records elsewhere. A "Personal Use" checkbox is included among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Record Requested to be Sent From" and "Record to be Sent To" facility sections) assumes an inter-facility transfer model. A patient wanting a copy of their own records must awkwardly fit themselves into the "Record to be Sent To" facility section.

Submission is available via **email** (registration@rvh.org) or **in person**. No fax number for submission is listed on the forms or in the notes, though the form collects fax numbers for the sending/receiving facilities. The email pathway means patients can submit without a physical visit, which is a meaningful accessibility advantage.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which is also accessible via the main website navigation (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records). All four PDFs are prominently linked with clear labels and descriptive filenames. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot protection blocking direct programmatic downloads — a hosting infrastructure issue, not an intentional barrier. The page includes contextual submission instructions alongside the download links.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — despite being born-digital and recently updated (December 2025), the form was designed for print-and-handwrite completion. A patient must print, fill by hand, scan or photograph, and email the result. This is a meaningful accessibility gap for a 2025-era document.

The layout is logically organized with clear section headers: patient information, sending facility, receiving facility, record type checkboxes, purpose checkboxes, and a signature block. The upper portion is clean and self-explanatory. The lower portion contains two dense legal paragraphs — a sensitive information disclosure notice (appropriately citing 42 C.F.R. Part 2 and HIPAA) and a certification block that packs six signer categories into a single run-on sentence. The certification text is challenging for a typical patient to parse.

The **color-coded instructional guides** (forms 3 and 4) are a genuine bright spot. They overlay plain-language annotations explaining each section ("Enter your personal information in this section," "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider"), effectively translating bureaucratic form headers into understandable instructions. This paired approach — plain form plus annotated guide — is uncommon and genuinely helpful.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no fee disclosure (meaning no upfront fee barrier, though patients are also not informed of costs). The authorization expires after 12 months, and revocation rights are clearly stated.

The form does **not** reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), does not include a patient rights statement, and does not state a response timeframe. These are missed opportunities but not violations.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: The bilingual form suite with instructional companions is exceptional. Providing annotated guides in both English and Spanish demonstrates genuine commitment to patient comprehension and language accessibility — this goes well beyond the typical approach of offering a bare authorization form. The forms are recently updated (December 2025), indicating active maintenance. Email submission availability removes the in-person barrier.

**Weaknesses**: The absence of fillable fields in a born-digital 2025 PDF is a notable gap. The form's generic ROI authorization design does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a bidirectional facility-routing model when they simply want their own records. The Spanish version contains minor translation errors (CRF vs. CFR, missing closing parenthesis).

## Overall Assessment

Cherokee Health Systems earns a **B grade** overall. The organization clearly invested in patient communication — the bilingual instructional guides are a model other organizations should emulate. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the form wasn't designed with that use case front-of-mind.

# Lankenau Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lankenau Medical Center is part of **Main Line Health**, a regional nonprofit health system in suburban Philadelphia. The facility does not publish its own records request form; instead, it uses a system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form managed centrally by Main Line Health. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URLs on mainlinehealth.org — form-1.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0621, June 2021) with 41 fillable fields and interactive buttons, and form-2.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0325, March 2025) as a flat, non-interactive PDF with zero fillable fields. Both are 2-page documents with identical content structure.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed to serve all disclosure purposes — release to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. That said, Main Line Health does include **"Patient personal use"** as an explicit purpose checkbox, which is a positive accommodation. However, the form's framing remains disclosure-oriented: it asks the patient to specify "This information is to be disclosed to: Name of Person or Institution," meaning a patient requesting their own records must somewhat awkwardly write their own name as the disclosure recipient. There is no separate, streamlined pathway for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A straightforward web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No bot blocking, authentication, or patient portal login was required. The form is prominently published on the Main Line Health website. The only minor friction is that two versions coexist at different URLs without any clear indication of which is current — a patient could inadvertently download the older fillable version or the newer flat version.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing based on **form-1.pdf** (the fillable version, which provides the better patient experience):

- **Fillable fields**: Yes — 41 interactive fields plus PRINT, SAVE AS, EMAIL, and RESET action buttons. The EMAIL button suggests the form can be completed and submitted entirely digitally. This is genuinely digital-first design.
- **Layout**: Clean and logically organized — facility selection → patient ID → date range → record types → sensitive information → recipient → purpose → delivery → expiration → signatures, with a full instructions page on the reverse.
- **Language**: A mix of plain and legal language. The rights acknowledgment paragraphs are substantive but dense. Instructions on page 2 are clear and well-structured.
- **Instructions**: Thorough. Numbered instructions cover completion requirements, submission methods (fax, email, mail, walk-in), a delivery options matrix by recipient type, fee information, and detailed signing authority guidance for minors, incapacitated patients, and deceased patients under PA law.
- **Delivery options**: Exceptionally strong — six options including encrypted USB, MyChart portal, printed paper (pick-up or mail), fax, and encrypted email/third-party portal. A clear table shows availability by recipient type.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Prepayment language**: The instructions state "payment will be expected prior to the records being delivered," which could function as a barrier to patient access. Under HIPAA, covered entities should not condition record delivery on prepayment in a way that creates unreasonable barriers.
- **Witness line ambiguity**: A "(Signature of Witness)" field is present but the form does not clarify whether a witness is required, potentially confusing patients completing the form at home.
- **Fee amounts undisclosed**: The form references fees "in accordance with Federal and PA State Law" but does not specify amounts, leaving patients uncertain about costs.
- **No notarization required**: Correct — the form does not impose this unnecessary barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Excellent delivery options** with encrypted electronic formats and a clear availability matrix
- **Fillable PDF** with embedded action buttons (form-1 version)
- **"Patient personal use" checkbox** that normalizes self-access requests
- **Detailed signing authority guidance** reflecting PA-specific law
- **Sensitive information opt-in** with separate checkboxes for HIV, psychiatric, and substance abuse records
- **HIPAA-compliant response timelines** clearly stated (30/60 days with 30-day extension)

## Overall Assessment

Main Line Health provides an above-average records request experience for Lankenau Medical Center patients. The form is easy to find, technically well-executed (in its fillable version), and offers unusually comprehensive delivery options. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic third-party disclosure form and adapt it to their own needs. The prepayment language and undisclosed fee amounts are minor compliance concerns. Overall, this represents a solid **B-grade** experience: a patient can accomplish their goal, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# Community Health Center, Inc. — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Middletown, Connecticut. Three PDF forms were retrieved: a standard English ROI authorization (form-2, Rev. 6/2019), a Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 7/2019), and a site-specific variant pre-filled for the Birth to Three early intervention program (form-1). The standard English form (form-2) is the most relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway and Patient Self-Access

CHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All three PDFs are variants of a single generic "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information" — a dual-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for both releasing records to third parties and obtaining records from other providers. However, the form does include an explicit self-request section: "If to ME, my records should be released via: Mail / Fax / Pick-Up / E-Mail." This accommodates patient self-access but does not distinguish it as a separate regulatory pathway (§164.524 Right of Access vs. §164.508 third-party authorization).

The patient forms page on chc1.com has transitioned from direct PDF links to Luma Health online portals for ROI requests. Two Luma Health links are now offered ("CHC to release health information to another agency" and "CHC to obtain health information from another agency"), suggesting the organization is modernizing its workflow. The site also references a myCHC patient portal for online record access. The legacy PDFs remain hosted in the WordPress uploads directory but are no longer linked from the patient-facing navigation.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability was **moderate**. The patient forms page is navigable, but the PDF forms themselves are legacy documents — discoverable only via web search or URL pattern guessing. The current site directs patients to Luma Health portals. No bot blocking or download difficulties were encountered; all PDFs downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-2) is a well-organized **single-page** document with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of disclosure → self-request delivery options → record type checkboxes → date range → sensitive information opt-ins → reason → expiration → legal notices → signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and a side-by-side column design for the "Release TO" vs. "Obtain FROM" paths.

The form is **not fillable** — zero interactive PDF fields despite being a digitally authored document. All blanks are underscored lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. Submission is via fax (860-343-7379) or mail (575 Main Street, Middletown, CT 06457). A patient would need to print the form, fill it by hand, and fax or mail it in.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though the legal disclosure paragraph at the bottom is dense. The form provides approximately 20 fields for a self-request (patient demographics, delivery method, record types, date range, reason, signature block). Record type options are granular (9 categories plus "Other"), and patients can specify date ranges and selectively exclude sensitive information.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fax submission is available, so physical delivery is not the only option. No fees are mentioned. The form states a 30-day fulfillment window, consistent with HIPAA requirements.

Two minor compliance concerns: (1) the form asks for a reason for the request (Legal, Transferring Care, etc.), which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA; and (2) the default scope is the last 3 years unless a broader range is specified — this could inadvertently limit patients who don't realize they must explicitly request their full record.

A typo persists in the legal text ("in response to his authorization" instead of "this authorization") across both English forms.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version** available — important for an FQHC serving a diverse Connecticut population
- **Email delivery** offered as a self-request option, which is uncommon and reduces barriers
- **Granular exclusion controls** for drug/alcohol information (patients can specify what to exclude, not just all-or-nothing)
- **Transition to Luma Health portal** suggests active modernization of the records request process
- **Single-page design** keeps the form concise and manageable

## Overall Assessment

CHC provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient self-access. The generic authorization form accommodates self-requests via a dedicated delivery section, and the availability of a Spanish translation and email delivery are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of fillable fields, the conflation of patient access with third-party release, the legacy status of the PDF forms, and minor compliance gaps (reason field, default 3-year scope) prevent the organization from scoring higher. The transition to Luma Health portals is promising but could not be fully evaluated. **Grade: C** — adequate with notable room for improvement.

# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Anchorage, Alaska. Two documents were retrieved from its publicly accessible forms page: a primary ROI authorization form ("Advanced Authorization for Release of Information," Rev. 08/2025) and a standing PHI Disclosure Agreement (Rev. 8/4/23). Of these, form-1 is the relevant document for a patient requesting copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

ANHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary ROI form (form-1) is a dual-purpose generic HIPAA authorization covering both "obtain information from" an external source and "release information to" a third party. A patient wanting their own records must check "Release Information to" and fill in their own name and address as the recipient — functional, but not intuitive. The form's instructions frame it around sending records elsewhere, not around the patient's individual Right of Access. There is no separate, simplified pathway for patients who just want their own records.

That said, the form does include a notably strong patient-rights statement: it explicitly cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and tells patients they are "NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information." This is uncommon and commendable, partially compensating for the generic form structure.

The retrieval notes also mention a text-based ROI request option (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which could be a more accessible alternative channel, though its scope and workflow aren't detailed on the forms page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped search surfaced the ANHC forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms), which is well-organized with clear section headings including a "Request a Release of Information" section with direct PDF links. No bot blocking, captchas, or authentication barriers were encountered. The form was also available in Spanish, which is a notable accessibility feature for an FQHC. Difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally composed document — not a scan — with a clean text layer and reasonable file size (164 KB). However, despite being revised as recently as August 2025, it has **zero fillable PDF fields**. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and return it via fax or in person. This is a significant missed opportunity for a document that is clearly digitally designed.

The form collects approximately 15 fields: patient name, DOB, last four SSN digits, two phone numbers, full address, recipient information, record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization, date range, and signature. Requesting SSN digits is unnecessary for a records request and adds friction. The form fits everything on one page, which is efficient but dense. Layout is adequate with clear section divisions, though the volume of content compressed onto a single page limits whitespace.

Language is generally accessible. The introductory "PLEASE READ" paragraph is clear and plain-language. The legal disclosure section is denser but not impenetrable, covering authorization voluntariness, expiration, revocation rights, and redisclosure prohibitions. There is a typo ("heath care" instead of "health care") and a malformed HIPAA citation in the legal text.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Fees**: The form discloses that ANHC charges for copies, with an exception for facility-to-facility transfers. It does not clarify that patient self-access requests are subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee limits, which could discourage patients.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting the last four SSN digits is unnecessary and creates friction.
- **No notarization** required — positive.
- **Submission**: Fax (907-743-7255) is available as an electronic submission method. The form also lists the physical address. No email or portal submission option exists for the ROI form itself, though ANHC does use MyChart (referenced in form-2).
- **Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit HIPAA Right of Access citation** (45 CFR § 164.524) with clear patient-empowering language
- **Spanish-language version** of the ROI form available
- **Text-message alternative** for initiating ROI requests
- **Recently revised** (08/2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Adolescent privacy protections** on form-2 (MyChart proxy access controls for minors 12–17)

## Overall Assessment

ANHC presents a mixed picture. The forms are easy to find, the website is well-organized, and several bright spots — Spanish availability, text-message option, explicit HIPAA rights language — show genuine attention to patient access. However, the core pathway funnels patients through a generic third-party authorization form rather than offering a dedicated patient self-access route, the primary PDF has no fillable fields despite recent revision, and the fee language could discourage patients from exercising their rights. For an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations, the lack of a fillable digital form is a notable gap. The organization earns credit for accessibility features and rights transparency, but falls short on digital form quality and access pathway differentiation.

# Brattleboro Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, an independent nonprofit community hospital in Brattleboro, Vermont, publishes three ROI-related forms on its website. All three are general-purpose HIPAA disclosure authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to or from third parties. None is a dedicated patient access request form. The most current version — form-1.pdf, dated January 2025 — serves as the primary pathway for any patient requesting their own records, though patients must navigate a third-party-oriented workflow to do so.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three forms use a FROM/TO structure designed for transfers between parties. A patient requesting their own records would need to select the "Personal Records" purpose checkbox (available only on form-1 and form-3, not form-2) and enter their own name in the "TO" field — a workable but unintuitive approach. There is no online portal, patient portal integration, or web-based request wizard. The hospital's HIM Department lists a phone number (802-257-8258) and fax number (802-257-8881) on the form header, providing fax as an electronic submission channel, though the form itself never explicitly states how to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Standard web searches immediately returned direct PDF links hosted on the hospital's WordPress site. No login, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. However, the three overlapping forms are published without any landing page, version guidance, or indication of which is current. A patient who finds form-2 (older, shorter, with a witness line and 6-month default expiration) gets a materially different experience than one who finds form-1 (updated, more comprehensive, 12-month expiration, no witness line).

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1.pdf** (the best available) is a 2-page flat PDF. Despite retrieval notes suggesting fillable fields, metadata confirms zero interactive form fields — all blanks are underscore lines and text-rendered checkbox characters. Patients must print, handwrite, and submit via fax or physical delivery. The two-page structure is logical (instructions/rights on page 1, data entry on page 2), and required fields are marked with an asterisk convention. However, page 2 is densely packed with FROM/TO fields, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, verbal communication designees, date ranges, and signature blocks. Some checkbox labels are misaligned across columns. The language mixes plain statements with ALL CAPS instructions and bureaucratic phrasing — Instruction 4, which conditions processing on internal record completeness, is particularly confusing for patients.

The form offers approximately 15 fields for patient completion, a reasonable scope. Record-type checkboxes are comprehensive, covering standard categories plus sensitive information (psychiatric, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, hepatitis) and notably progressive categories (reproductive health care, gender affirming care). Delivery options are limited to "Pick Up" and "Send Out" with no electronic delivery mentioned.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on form-1 (though form-2 includes a witness line that may create perceived barriers). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "in accordance with state and federal law" — without specific amounts or a fee schedule. No response time commitment is stated. The form does not require in-person submission, and fax is available as an electronic submission pathway.

## Notable Strengths

- **Progressive sensitive-information categories**: The January 2025 revision includes Reproductive Health Care and Gender Affirming Care checkboxes — unusually inclusive for a community hospital.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to receive health services" directly addresses a common patient concern.
- **Verbal communication designees**: A dedicated section for authorizing up to three individuals for verbal communication with the hospital goes beyond typical ROI forms.
- **Easy online availability**: Forms are publicly accessible without any barriers to download.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: All forms funnel patients through a generic third-party disclosure workflow.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: The primary form cannot be completed digitally despite its digitally-authored appearance.
- **Multiple unversioned forms**: Three overlapping documents with no guidance creates confusion.
- **No electronic delivery options**: Only physical pickup or mail for receiving records.
- **No explicit submission instructions**: Fax and phone numbers are listed but the form never tells patients how to submit it.

## Overall Assessment

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The forms are easy to find and free of egregious barriers, and the January 2025 update shows thoughtfulness around sensitive health categories. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, non-fillable form format, and absence of electronic delivery options place the hospital behind peers who have modernized their records request processes. The overall experience earns a **C grade** — functional but not patient-centered.

# Boone County Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Boone County Health Center (BCHC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Albion, Nebraska. The organization provides a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests — there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway. Three documents were found: the current ROI form (form-2), a superseded 2017 version (form-1), and a HIPAA Contact Information form (form-3) that is explicitly not an ROI substitute.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The primary and only ROI form is form-2, "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information," uploaded in February 2026 as a Microsoft Word .docx file. This replaced an older PDF version (form-1, August 2017) that remains accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the website. The current form is a generic authorization that handles both outbound release ("Release Information To") and inbound record requests ("Obtain Records From") through a single check-one mechanism. While a "Patient Request" purpose checkbox exists, the form does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party authorization, and makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — basic web searches surfaced both the old and new versions, and the current form is listed on the Patient Forms section under Patient Resources > General Information. The main complication is that the current form is published only as a .docx file, which is unusual and less accessible than PDF. The website also requires JavaScript rendering to display form links. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page document with a logical flow: patient identification, release direction, purpose, date range, record types, sensitive information authorization, delivery format, legal acknowledgments, and signatures. It has zero fillable fields — all inputs are underscore blank lines, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The .docx format theoretically allows typing, but without proper form fields the experience is poor.

The layout is reasonably organized with clear sections, though the release direction framing ("Release Information To" vs. "Obtain Records From") is confusing for patients who simply want their own records. The sensitive information section has garbled instruction text from formatting issues. Language is generally plain and accessible, with concise legal acknowledgments. There are no instructions explaining how to submit the completed form, though the header provides phone, fax, and a dedicated ROI email address (Roi@boonecohealth.org).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is required. Fee disclosure is vague — the form states "copy fees may apply in accordance with Nebraska law" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access and third-party fees. A photo ID/witness requirement appears on the signature line but its scope is ambiguous — it may apply only to in-person pickup. The form includes a proper non-coercion statement, re-disclosure warning, 12-month fixed expiration, and revocation rights. No turnaround time is stated. A typo ("Heath" instead of "Health") appears in the legal section.

Submission methods include fax (402-395-2180), potentially email (Roi@boonecohealth.org is listed but not explicitly stated as a submission channel), mail, and in-person delivery. Fax availability means electronic submission is possible without visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

BCHC shows several bright spots unusual for a small critical access hospital: a dedicated ROI email address suggesting a staffed intake process, encrypted email as a delivery format option, and careful handling of sensitive information categories with separate initials required for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV/AIDS records per Nebraska law. The form is compact (2 pages) and avoids excessive legalese.

## Notable Weaknesses

The .docx-only publication format is a meaningful accessibility barrier. The lack of fillable fields means this is fundamentally a paper workflow. The generic authorization framing without any acknowledgment of patient access rights under HIPAA means a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for third-party release. The continued availability of the superseded 2017 form at its original URL creates confusion risk.

## Overall Assessment

Boone County Health Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is findable and the content is adequate, but it reflects a traditional paper-centric approach with no digital-first design or patient access differentiation. The bright spots — dedicated email, encrypted delivery, compact design — show genuine effort, but the .docx format, lack of fillable fields, and generic authorization framing hold back the overall experience. A patient can get the job done, but must figure out the process largely on their own.

# Mercy General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy General Hospital, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Sacramento, CA, provides patients with a reasonably accessible but structurally fragmented records request process. Three forms were found: a general third-party authorization (form-1), a medical group patient access form (form-2), and a hospital patient access form (form-3). The organization correctly separates patient self-access from third-party release — a meaningful positive — but splits patient access across two entities (hospital vs. medical group), requiring patients to navigate dual tracks.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mercy General Hospital does differentiate individual access from third-party release. Both form-2 and form-3 are titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and explicitly state they will not result in disclosure to anyone other than the patient or their representative. The third-party authorization (form-1) is a clearly separate document. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations funnel all requests through a single generic HIPAA authorization form.

However, the dual-track structure (hospital form vs. medical group form) creates confusion. A patient who received both inpatient and outpatient care at Mercy General would need to submit two different forms to two different departments. The website does not provide clear guidance on which form to use, and the hospital vs. medical group distinction is opaque to most patients.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. All three were accessible via web search and linked from the Dignity Health Sacramento medical records page. One URL from search results returned a 404, suggesting some form reorganization over time, but current links worked. The forms' filenames are reasonably descriptive. Contact information (phone, fax, email) is provided on the medical group form, making it easy for patients to ask questions.

## Form Document Quality

The primary hospital patient access form (form-3) is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a significant gap, especially since the companion third-party authorization (form-1) has 42 fillable fields, demonstrating the organization has the capability to produce interactive PDFs. The medical group form (form-2) also has zero fillable fields. Both patient access forms are print-and-fill documents that were designed for in-person clinical workflows and posted online as an afterthought.

Form-3's text layer suffers from severe font encoding corruption — extracted text contains garbled characters (e.g., "3DWLHQW ,GHQWL¿FDWLRQ" for "Patient Identification"), which likely renders the form inaccessible to screen readers.

The layout of both patient access forms is logical with lettered sections, clear record-type checkboxes, and multiple delivery format options (Paper, USB Drive, CD, Secure Email, Unsecured Email for form-3; mail, pickup, email, flash drive, fax for form-2). Language is mostly plain, though some legalistic phrasing appears in the sensitive records sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flags relate to physician gatekeeping of patient access:

- **Physician veto mechanism**: Form-3 includes a "NOTIFICATION TO DOCTOR" section that actively solicits physician objections to releasing records, without informing the patient of their right to appeal a denial.
- **Physician approval for HIV and psychiatric records**: Both patient access forms require physician/caregiver approval before releasing HIV test results or psychiatric records to the patient — a requirement that likely conflicts with HIPAA's right of access, which generally does not condition patient access on provider approval.
- **ID verification contradiction**: Form-2 demands "PICTURE I.D. MUST BE PRESENTED" while simultaneously offering mail, email, and fax submission — contradictory requirements.

Fee disclosure is vague on both forms ("fees may apply") without specifying amounts. Form-3 references an "attached price list" that is not included in the PDF. Neither form states a response timeline, and neither includes a patient rights section (unlike the third-party authorization form, which does).

## Strengths

- Clear separation of patient access from third-party release, with explicit cross-references between forms
- Multiple electronic delivery options including USB drive, CD, secure and unsecured email
- Inspect-only option on form-2 (no copying fees)
- Direct contact information (phone, fax, email) prominently displayed
- Multi-facility coverage across six Dignity Health Sacramento hospitals

## Overall Assessment

Mercy General Hospital demonstrates good intent in creating dedicated patient access forms separate from third-party authorizations, and offers genuinely flexible delivery options. However, the execution falls short: non-fillable PDFs, encoding accessibility issues, physician gatekeeping provisions, and a confusing dual-track structure undermine patient-centeredness. The organization invests more technical effort in the third-party release form (42 fillable fields) than in its patient access forms (zero fillable fields each), suggesting that patient self-access is not the priority workflow. A patient can ultimately navigate the process, but must contend with printing forms, unclear fee structures, and potentially inappropriate physician approval requirements.

      "rationale": "Rubric level 4 (easy to find with basic navigation or simple search): forms page is linked from main navigation as 'Patient Forms,' multiple web search strategies returned direct PDF URLs, and the Swellbox wizard link is on the same page — all accessible within 2-3 clicks from the homepage."
    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3 (usable digitally with workarounds): all seven PDF forms have zero fillable fields requiring print-and-handwrite completion, but the Swellbox online wizard provides an electronic self-request alternative; the PDF forms themselves have native text layers enabling assistive technology use."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3 (adequate but has notable problems): form-1 has clear section headers and logical organization on a single page, but fee disclosure is confusingly placed under the 'Other' checkbox, submission instructions are entirely absent, and the 1-year default records limitation is buried in parenthetical text."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3 (patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them): the PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with 'Name of Physician/Organization' labels implying provider recipients, though the Swellbox 'Electronic Self Request' wizard suggests a patient-oriented pathway exists alongside the generic form."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 4 (minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding): fees are within HIPAA limits ($0.07/page, $6.50/disc), no notarization or witness required, expiration and revocation properly stated, but the undefined 'shipping and handling' surcharge and missing re-disclosure warning are minor gaps."
    },
    "overall": {
      "score": 3.35,
      "grade": "C",
      "summary": "ACP provides easy-to-find forms and a Swellbox electronic self-request option that elevates the digital experience, but the primary PDF form is a generic non-fillable third-party authorization lacking submission instructions and patient-access-specific design."
