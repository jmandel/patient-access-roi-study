## Organization
- **Name:** Barrett Hospital & HealthCare
- **Location:** Dillon, MT
- **Website:** https://www.barretthospital.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF:** Searched `"Barrett Hospital HealthCare" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct PDF link found.
2. **Web search for release form:** Searched `"Barrett Hospital HealthCare" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — no direct result.
3. **Site-specific search:** Searched `site:barretthospital.org authorization release medical records` — this identified the **Request Medical Records** page at `https://www.barretthospital.org/request-medical-records`.
4. **Website navigation:** Navigated to the Request Medical Records page. Found a clearly labeled link: *"Click here to download an Authorization to Release records to obtain a copy of your medical records."*

**What worked:** The site-specific search quickly identified the correct page. The form was easy to find — linked directly from the medical records page, which is accessible under Patients & Visitors.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.barretthospital.org/_files/ugd/317b8b_409f155b0bef424f92bb8408fa8858de.pdf
- **File size:** 178,857 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Document type:** Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (ROI form)
- **Initial impression:** This is Barrett Hospital's official ROI/authorization form. It is a single-page form titled "AUTHORIZATION FOR DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION." It includes fields for patient name, DOB, SSN (last 4 digits), the entity to receive/release records to, purpose of release, specific record types (lab, imaging, pathology, mental health/substance abuse, etc.), date ranges, format (paper or electronic), and delivery method (pick up, fax, mail, other). Includes 42 CFR Part 2 notice regarding substance abuse records, HIV/AIDS disclosure consent, and a 1-year authorization validity period. Form revision date: 2.2022.

## Difficulties
- None. The form was straightforward to find — clearly linked from the medical records page.
- The website is built on Wix, with the PDF hosted on Wix static files.

# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf** — No direct ANHC results; returned generic examples from other organizations.
2. **Web search for "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf** — Found a related ROI instructions document on choices-ak.org mentioning ANHC's mailing/fax details.
3. **Web search for site:anhc.org authorization release medical records** — Successfully identified the ANHC forms page at https://www.anhc.org/forms with direct PDF links.
4. **Fetched the ANHC forms page** — Found clearly organized sections including "Request a Release of Information" with the main ROI form and a separate "PHI Disclosure Agreement."

The third search strategy (site-scoped search) was most effective, directly surfacing the forms page.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.anhc.org/s/Advanced-Authorization-for-Release-of-Information-Rev-8-2025.pdf
- **Document title:** "Advanced Authorization for Release of Information"
- **Revision:** Rev. 8/2025
- **Initial impression:** This is the primary ROI/authorization form. It allows patients to authorize ANHC to either obtain records from another source or release ANHC records to another party. Includes sections for patient demographics, choice of obtain vs. release, types of information (History & Physical, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, X-Ray Reports, Immunization Records, Medication List), and special authorization for sensitive topics (Substance Use Disorder). Lists ANHC address at 4951 Business Park Boulevard, Anchorage, AK 99503.
- **File size:** ~164 KB
- **Has text layer:** Yes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.anhc.org/s/PHIDisclosureAgreementENGLISH9-22-23.pdf
- **Document title:** "PHI Disclosure Agreement"
- **Revision:** Rev. 8/4/23
- **Initial impression:** This is a PHI (Protected Health Information) Disclosure Agreement — a standing authorization form that lets patients designate specific people who may access their PHI. Also covers MyChart proxy access for minors (ages 12-17). Single page form. Not a traditional ROI form but related to information sharing authorization.
- **File size:** ~128 KB
- **Has text layer:** Yes

## Difficulties Encountered

- **None significant.** The forms were easy to find on the ANHC website. The forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms) is well-organized with clear section headings. The ROI form was available in both English and Spanish, and the PDF downloaded without any bot blocking or authentication requirements.
- The organization also offers an online/text-based option for ROI requests (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which is notable for accessibility.

## Additional Context

- ANHC also has a "Notice of Privacy Practices" PDF available on the same forms page, but this was not downloaded as it's a privacy notice rather than an authorization form.
- The choices-ak.org site had ROI instructions referencing ANHC, suggesting a historical or affiliated relationship, but the current ANHC website has its own updated forms.

# Cordova Community Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Cordova Community Medical Center (CCMC)
- **Website:** https://www.cdvcmc.com
- **Location:** Cordova, AK
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, government-owned

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Cordova Community Medical Center authorization release health information form PDF"** — Immediately found a direct link to the PDF on their website at `https://www.cdvcmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Release-of-Information-form.pdf`.
2. **Web search for site:cdvcmc.com medical records** — Confirmed the form is linked from the Medical Records page at `https://www.cdvcmc.com/for-patients/medical-records/`.
3. **Browsed the Medical Records page** — The page clearly explains patient rights to receive health information and links directly to the same ROI form PDF. Only one form is offered for medical records release.
4. **Checked Patient Forms page** — Contains registration, consent, minor consent, financial assistance, and payment plan forms, but no additional ROI-related forms.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.cdvcmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Release-of-Information-form.pdf
- **File size:** 75,222 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Document type:** ROI / Authorization for Release of Protected Patient Health Information
- **Initial impression:** Single-page authorization form branded to CCMC. Has a text layer (not a scan). Covers both obtaining information from and releasing information to third parties. Includes fields for patient name, DOB, MR#, purpose of release, specific record types, date ranges, signature, and date. Notes a 3-month expiration from signature date. References HIPAA (45 CFR 164.524) and federal substance abuse confidentiality rules (42 CFR Part 2). Does not appear to have fillable form fields (flat PDF). Mentions the right to receive a copy in preferred format (paper, email, CD, or fax) on the website page but not on the form itself.

## Difficulties
- **None.** The form was easy to find — a single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The medical records page on the website is clearly linked and provides a straightforward download link. The PDF downloaded without any bot blocking or authentication requirements.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy

# UAB Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `UAB Hospital Birmingham Alabama "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links to the patient request form and Callahan Eye form.
2. **Web search** for `UAB Medicine "medical records" "release form" request PDF` — found the third-party authorization form and confirmed the medical records request page URL.
3. **Navigated the UAB Medicine website** at `https://www.uabmedicine.org/pay-your-bill/medical-records-request/` — this is the main medical records request page. It clearly distinguishes between (1) patient requesting own records and (2) third-party release, with separate downloadable forms for each.

The web search strategy was highly effective — UAB Medicine makes their forms readily accessible with direct PDF download links.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.uabmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Patient-Request-own-medical-records.pdf`
- **Document type:** Patient Request for Own Medical Records (ROI form — patient access specific)
- **File size:** 341,021 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Text extractable:** Yes, clean text extraction
- **Notes:** This is the primary patient-access ROI form. It recognizes the patient's right to access their own PHI. Offers multiple record packages (key clinical notes, full record, etc.), delivery options (paper mail, pickup, fax, CD, email), and includes options for psychiatric/substance use records. Well-structured with clear sections. Form number F#2197r, approved 06/02/2023.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.uabmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Callahan-Hospital-Patient-Medical-Records-Request_12.18.2024.pdf`
- **Document type:** Hospital Patient Access / Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information (Callahan Eye Hospital variant)
- **File size:** 108,099 bytes
- **Pages:** 3
- **Text extractable:** Yes, clean text extraction
- **Notes:** Callahan Eye Hospital-specific variant of the ROI form. Similar structure to form-1 but tailored for UAB Hospital–Callahan Eye. Includes option to request both Callahan Eye and UAB Health System records. Approved 7/25/2025. Has fewer record package options (2 packages vs 5). Includes same delivery method options.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.uabmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Authorization.pdf`
- **Document type:** Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (third-party release)
- **File size:** 637,412 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Text extractable:** Partially — pdftotext produces garbled output due to CID font encoding (Identity-H). The PDF uses custom-encoded CID Type 0C fonts that don't map cleanly to Unicode. The document is viewable in a PDF reader but text extraction is unreliable.
- **Notes:** This is the general third-party authorization form (for releasing records to attorneys, insurance companies, etc., rather than patient self-access). Same record package structure as form-1. Linked from the medical records request page under "I am requesting that my medical records be sent directly to a third party."

## Difficulties

- **Form-3 text extraction:** The third-party authorization form (form-3.pdf) uses CID Type 0C fonts with Identity-H encoding that produce garbled text when extracted with pdftotext. The fonts have non-standard glyph mappings. The PDF renders correctly visually but automated text extraction is unreliable.
- **No other difficulties:** Forms were easy to find — UAB Medicine's medical records request page is clearly organized and directly linked from their billing/payment section with prominent download links.

## Summary

UAB Hospital (UAB Medicine) provides three distinct downloadable PDF forms for medical records requests:
1. A patient self-access form (form-1) — the primary ROI form
2. A Callahan Eye Hospital variant (form-2) — for the affiliated eye hospital
3. A third-party authorization form (form-3) — for releasing records to others

The patient self-access form (form-1) is the most relevant ROI form for this study. It is well-organized, offers granular record selection and multiple delivery options including electronic formats.

# University Medical Center of Southern Nevada — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "University Medical Center of Southern Nevada authorization release health information form PDF"** — Immediately returned direct PDF links to the PHI Release Authorization form hosted on umcsn.com.
2. **Site-scoped search (`site:umcsn.com medical records release authorization form`)** — Confirmed the same PDF URL and also pointed to the Medical Records page.
3. **Navigated the Medical Records page** at `https://www.umcsn.com/patients-visitors/patient-information/medical-records-and-birth-certificate-process` — Notably, this page does **not** directly link to the PHI Release Authorization form. It links only to the Request for Amendment form. The ROI form is discoverable via search but not clearly linked from the patient-facing medical records page.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://umcsn.com/getmedia/43e12672-40c1-4b7e-a4fc-099306b86efc/MRU00695_PHI_Rel_Auth_Eng_01-29-19.pdf`
- **Document type:** PHI Release Authorization form (ROI form)
- **Version:** MRU00695 (01/29/19) — the current/newer version
- **Pages:** 2
- **File size:** 151,732 bytes
- **Text extractable:** Yes (has text layer, ~5,203 chars)
- **Notes:** This is the primary ROI form. It allows patients to authorize release of their Protected Health Information from UMC facilities (main campus, Quick Care, Primary Care). Includes checkboxes for types of records, sensitive information categories (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, genetic info), and signature fields. Two-page form with clear sections.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://umcsn.com/getmedia/38304303-0e51-4547-82ea-088afa777004/MRU00695PHI.pdf`
- **Document type:** PHI Release Authorization form (ROI form) — older version
- **Version:** MRU00695 (06/06/16)
- **Pages:** 2
- **File size:** 166,276 bytes
- **Text extractable:** Yes (has text layer, ~4,949 chars)
- **Notes:** This is the older (2016) version of the same ROI form. Very similar content and layout to form-1 but with slightly different field labels (e.g., "Account #" vs "CSN"). Both versions are still hosted and accessible on the UMCSN website.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.umcsn.com/getmedia/1dd2697c-e454-46e3-a217-a800685388a6/RequestforAmendmentPHI_English.pdf`
- **Document type:** Request for Amendment of Protected Health Information
- **Version:** MRU01840 (02/10/22)
- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 118,189 bytes
- **Text extractable:** Yes (has text layer, ~2,281 chars)
- **Notes:** This is NOT an ROI form — it's a form to request amendments to medical records. Found linked from the Medical Records page. Included because it was prominently linked on the medical records page and is part of the patient records access workflow.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **No direct link to the ROI form on the Medical Records page.** The main patient-facing "Medical Records and Birth Certificate Process" page links to the amendment form but does NOT link to the PHI Release Authorization form. The ROI form is only discoverable via web search or by knowing the direct URL. This is a notable findability gap.
- **Two versions of the same form still hosted.** Both the 2016 and 2019 versions are accessible, which could cause confusion for patients who find the older version.
- **No issues with downloading.** Both forms downloaded cleanly via curl with no bot-blocking or JavaScript requirements.

# Northwestern Memorial Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search**: Searched for "Northwestern Memorial Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" and "Northwestern Medicine medical records release form PDF". Both immediately returned direct links to the PDF forms on nm.org.
2. **No website navigation needed**: The web search results provided direct download URLs, making manual website navigation unnecessary.
3. **Parent system check**: Northwestern Memorial Hospital is part of Northwestern Medicine (Northwestern Memorial HealthCare / NMHC). The forms are published at the system level on nm.org and cover all NMHC entities.

## Difficulties

- None. Forms were straightforward to find and download. Northwestern Medicine makes their ROI forms readily available as direct PDF links from their media CDN.

# Advocare, LLC — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Advocare, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.advocaredoctors.com
- **Location:** Marlton, NJ
- **Type:** Independent physician practice, for-profit, Northeast

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF with authorization/release keywords** — General search results didn't return direct PDF links, but the `site:advocaredoctors.com` search yielded excellent results including a direct link to the medical records page and a CDN-hosted PDF from an individual Advocare practice site.

2. **Navigating the official website** — The medical records page (https://www.advocaredoctors.com/medical-records) is well-organized and clearly links to:
   - Online request via ShareCare platform
   - Downloadable authorization forms (English and Spanish)
   - Third-party requester portal

3. **What worked best:** The `site:advocaredoctors.com authorization release medical records` search immediately surfaced the medical records page, which had direct download links.

- **File size:** 189,083 bytes
- **Pages:** 1

- **File size:** 255,453 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** Spanish-language version of the authorization form (AUTORIZACIÓN PARA EL USO O DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN DE SALUD PROTEGIDA). Dated January 2024. Same content as form-2 but in Spanish. Linked from the official medical records page.

## Difficulties
- **None significant.** Advocare makes their forms easily accessible. The medical records page is straightforward to find and the PDFs download without any bot blocking or authentication requirements.
- The only minor note is that searching found an older version of the form (form-1.pdf) hosted on what appears to be an individual practice's CDN path, which differs slightly from the current official version (form-2.pdf).

## Summary
Advocare provides good online access to their ROI forms. The medical records page offers both online submission (via ShareCare) and downloadable PDF forms in English and Spanish. The retrieval difficulty was **easy** — the forms were findable via web search and clearly linked from the website.

# UTMB Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)
- **Website**: https://www.utmb.edu
- **Location**: Galveston, TX
- **Type**: Teaching hospital, government-owned, major system

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `UTMB "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found the UTMB medical records page and identified Forms 7033 and 7032.
2. **Web search** for `UTMB Galveston "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same forms and also surfaced a third-party copy hosted by Champion Records Service.
3. **Website navigation** — visited https://www.utmb.edu/utmbhealth/online-services/medical-records which is the official medical records request page. Forms are clearly listed with download links.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy-Moderate

The forms were easy to find (one click from search results), but downloading required extra effort because the PDFs are hosted on SharePoint (`liveutmb.sharepoint.com`), which doesn't respond to simple curl requests. Browser-based download was needed.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://liveutmb.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/collaboration/webfiles/Eco2ejThJIlDjcRxwSOsH14BR3PF8A5GzjVy_LSMcUOyrw?e=ajENiL
- **Original filename**: Patients Request for Medical Records.pdf
- **UTMB Form**: 7033 (English)
- **File size**: 279,350 bytes
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Patient/parent/guardian authorization form for release of PHI by UTMB. This is the form specifically designed for patients requesting their own records. Includes options for mail, email, and MyChart portal delivery. Has text layer. Covers entire or partial records with date ranges. Includes specific checkboxes for mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS information.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://liveutmb.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/collaboration/webfiles/EdAslXAlEhZDnOwaBpjq6ZcB3jXZPnOZRCFT3kTjcKuGpw?e=fqa7g7
- **Original filename**: Authorization_Form.pdf
- **UTMB Form**: 7032 (English)
- **File size**: 119,687 bytes
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: General HIPAA authorization for release of PHI by UTMB — for "all other requests" (not patient self-requests). Lists specific record types (emergency, hospital, clinic, radiology, lab, billing, etc.) with checkboxes. Has text layer. Includes purpose-of-request field and standard HIPAA authorization language.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.championrecordsservice.com/uploads/forms/2024/UTMB-HIPAA-Auth-10-16.pdf
- **Original filename**: UTMB-HIPAA-Auth-10-16.pdf
- **File size**: 121,604 bytes
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Third-party hosted copy of the UTMB HIPAA authorization form (appears to be a version of Form 7032), hosted by Champion Records Service. Very similar content to form-2.pdf but may be an older or alternate version (filename suggests October 2016 date). Downloaded directly via curl without issues.

## Key Observations

- UTMB has **two distinct ROI forms**: Form 7033 for patients/guardians requesting their own records, and Form 7032 for all other requestors. This is a patient-friendly distinction.
- The **patient form (7033) offers email and MyChart delivery options**, which is notable for digital accessibility.
- Forms are hosted on **SharePoint**, requiring browser-based download (curl receives HTML login pages).
- UTMB also partners with **Datavant/Swellbox** for online electronic records requests, offering a digital alternative to the paper forms.
- The medical records page is well-organized under Online Services > Request Medical Records, making it reasonably findable.
- Additional related forms are also available: 7032B (non-legal representative of minors), 7034 (authorization to release PHI *to* UTMB), revocation form, and amendment request form.

# Medical City Dallas Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Medical City Dallas Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" — returned several candidate URLs on `medicalcityhealthcare.com/util/forms/` but all returned 404 (URLs appear to be outdated/restructured).
2. **Direct website navigation** to the medical records page at `https://www.medicalcityhealthcare.com/locations/medical-city-dallas-hospital/for-patients/medical-records` — this was the successful strategy. The page clearly links to the authorization form PDFs hosted on `hcadam.com` (HCA's digital asset management platform).

## What Worked

Navigating the hospital's medical records page via browser. The page has a clear "Patient Requests" section with direct download links for the authorization form in English and Spanish. The forms are hosted on HCA's DAM platform (`hcadam.com`) rather than on the `medicalcityhealthcare.com` domain directly.

## Difficulties

- The PDF URLs cited in web search results (on `medicalcityhealthcare.com/util/forms/`) are all stale and return 404. The forms have been moved to HCA's central DAM platform.
- No issues with bot blocking or JavaScript rendering — the page loaded normally.

## Parent System

Medical City Dallas Hospital is part of Medical City Healthcare, which is part of HCA Healthcare (for-profit). The authorization form is an HCA system-wide form (mailing address is PO Box in Nashville, TN — HCA headquarters), not hospital-specific.

## Downloaded Files

Multi-section form covering patient info, recipient info, delivery preferences (paper, electronic media, encrypted/unencrypted email), expiration settings, record type selection (consultation, medication list, discharge summary, operative report, etc.), and signature sections. This is an HCA Healthcare system-wide ROI form.

# Riverside Community Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

- **Name:** Riverside Community Hospital
- **Location:** Riverside, CA
- **Website:** https://www.riversidecommunityhospital.com
- **Parent System:** HCA Healthcare (for-profit; confirmed by Nashville, TN mailing address and HCA branding)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Riverside Community Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form` — immediately surfaced the form URL on legalimage.net and the hospital's medical records page.
2. **Direct website navigation** to https://www.riversidecommunityhospital.com/patient-resources/medical-records — found the official page with links to both English and Spanish authorization forms hosted on HCA's CDN (hcadam.com), plus a link to a third-party ROI service (legalimage.net).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** http://legalimage.net/images/Forms/Riverside_Community_Hospital-medical_records_authorization.pdf
- **File size:** 141,169 bytes (5 pages)
- **Description:** "Authorization for Protected Health Information (PHI)" — includes 2 pages of instructions on how to complete the form, followed by the actual authorization form. Covers patient info, recipient info, request delivery method, purpose of disclosure, psychotherapy notes consent, and signature sections. This appears to be an older or alternative version of the form hosted by a third-party ROI vendor (Legal Image).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.hcadam.com/api/public/content/46695a9ba25e4b9aa6376f53cef033ac?v=b53c28b5

- **Description:** Spanish-language version ("Autorización para la divulgación de información médica") of the authorization form, also linked from the hospital's official medical records page. Same structure as form-2 but in Spanish.

## Difficulties
- **None significant.** The forms were easy to find — the hospital's medical records page is clearly linked under Patient Resources and provides direct PDF download links. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-rendered content issues.
- The legalimage.net URL (form-1) is served over HTTP (not HTTPS), which is a minor security concern for a healthcare form.

## Additional Notes
- Riverside Community Hospital is part of HCA Healthcare, the largest for-profit hospital system in the U.S. The ROI process is centralized through HCA's national medical records service (PO Box in Nashville, TN).
- The hospital also offers an online request portal via MyHealthONE patient portal and a separate Swellbox-based online request wizard.
- Retrieval difficulty: **Easy** — forms found within 1-2 clicks from the main medical records page.

# Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for specific facility + ROI keywords**: Searched `Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF`. This immediately returned the facility-specific authorization form PDF hosted on healthcare.ascension.org.

2. **Web search for parent system (Ascension) ROI forms**: Searched `Ascension health system "release of information" "authorization form" medical records request PDF`. Found that Ascension uses market/state-specific ROI forms — each region has its own version. The Florida/Pensacola form was already found in strategy 1.

3. **Navigated the facility's medical records page**: Visited the Ascension Sacred Heart patient portal and medical records page (`healthcare.ascension.org/locations/florida/flpen/sfch/patient-and-family-resources/patient-portal-and-medical-records`). The page directs patients to a Swellbox-powered online records request wizard but also references downloadable forms. It also mentions patients can use the patient portal to access most records directly.

## Downloaded Forms

Has authorization expiration language (one year). This is the main ROI form for the facility.

- **File size**: 199,659 bytes (200 KB)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Document type**: Medical Records Release Form — Department of Radiation Oncology specific
- **Initial impression**: Single-page records release form specific to the Sacred Heart Cancer Center / Department of Radiation Oncology. This form is for requesting records *from* another provider *to* Sacred Heart (records flow inbound to their Radiation Oncology department at 1545 Airport Blvd, Suite 1000, Pensacola FL 32504). Includes similar fields to form-1 but is department-specific and oriented toward incoming records rather than patient self-request.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **None significant**. The main ROI form was easily discoverable via web search and directly downloadable as a PDF without any bot blocking or JavaScript rendering requirements.
- The facility's medical records page primarily directs patients to a Swellbox online wizard for records requests, but the traditional PDF form is also available via direct URL on the Ascension content delivery system.
- Ascension is a large national system with market-specific forms. The Florida/Pensacola form (form-1.pdf) is the correct one for this facility.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy

The form was found on the first web search and downloaded without issues.

# Texas Oncology — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Texas Oncology "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — returned results pointing to the medical records page at texasoncology.com/medical-records, plus several older PDF URLs that turned out to be stale (404).
2. **Direct website navigation** — navigated to https://www.texasoncology.com/medical-records using browser. The page clearly lists the form under "How to Request Medical Records" with direct download links for both English and Spanish versions. The site has migrated to a Sitecore Edge CDN (`edge.sitecorecloud.io`), and older URLs (e.g., `/libraries/forms/...` and `/media/...`) no longer work.

## What Worked

Navigating directly to the Medical Records page via browser was the most reliable approach. The page is well-organized: Step 1 links to the form downloads, Step 2 says to complete it, Step 3 says to submit by fax or mail.

## Difficulties

- Three older PDF URLs found via web search all returned 404 errors — the site appears to have been restructured/migrated to Sitecore Edge CDN.
- Once the current URLs were found from the live page, downloads worked without issue (no bot blocking or login required).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf

Has text layer (not a scan). 3 pages.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/texasoncolo7d12-txo5d45-production6298-d24c/media/Files/Medical-Records/TXO-Protected-Health-Information-Disclosure-Authorization-Form-Spanish.pdf
- **File size**: 312,173 bytes (305 KB)
- **Pages**: 3
- **Description**: "Autorización Para Divulgar Información de Salud Protegida" — Spanish version of the same ROI form. Same structure and content as the English version. Has text layer.

## Summary

Texas Oncology makes their ROI form readily available on a dedicated Medical Records page (1 click from footer navigation). Both English and Spanish versions are provided as direct PDF downloads. The form is a general authorization for disclosure of protected health information, not specifically a patient-access form — it covers multiple disclosure reasons including personal use. The process requires printing, signing, and submitting by fax or mail.

# UCSF Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

1. **Web search**: Searched for `UCSF Medical Center authorization release health information medical records form PDF` — immediately found the direct PDF URL on ucsfhealth.org.
2. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:ucsfhealth.org authorization release medical records form` — confirmed the same form and found the medical records landing page.
3. **Website navigation**: Fetched `https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-records` — the Medical Records page clearly links to the English and Spanish versions of the authorization form. The page also describes the request process, fees ($0.25/page or $25 electronic), and MyChart as an alternative.

## What Worked

The first web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link. The UCSF Health website has a clear, well-organized Medical Records page that links directly to downloadable forms.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf

- **Description**: "Authorization for Release of Health Information" — the English ROI form. This appears to be an older URL/revision (Rev. 04/21 in filename, though text says Rev. 04/22). 162,793 bytes.
- **Initial impression**: Standard ROI authorization form. Has text layer, checkboxes for record types (ER visit, entire hospital record, clinic visit, billing, radiology images, dental, reproductive health), delivery method options (mail, pick-up, online portal), and special authorization sections for substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing records. References California-specific codes.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.ucsfhealth.org/-/media/project/ucsf/ucsf-health/pdf/roi-authorization.pdf`
- **Description**: "Authorization for Release of Health Information" — English ROI form linked from the current Medical Records page. 226,907 bytes. Same textual content as form-1 (both say Rev. 04/22) but different file size and hash, suggesting it may be a re-exported or updated PDF file.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.ucsfhealth.org/-/media/project/ucsf/ucsf-health/pdf/roi-authorization-sp.pdf`

## Difficulties

- **None significant**: Forms were easy to find and download. No bot blocking, no login walls, no JavaScript-only rendering. UCSF Health has a straightforward, patient-friendly approach to making these forms available.
- The only minor note is that two different URLs serve what appears to be the same English form with slightly different PDF files (different sizes/hashes but same extracted text). The version linked from the current Medical Records page (`roi-authorization.pdf`) is likely the canonical one.

- **Website**: https://mountainview-hospital.com (redirects to sunrisehealthinfo.com)
- **Parent System**: HCA Healthcare / Sunrise Health (part of the Sunrise Health network alongside Sunrise Hospital, Southern Hills Hospital, and Sunrise Children's Hospital)
- **Type**: Community hospital, for-profit, major system affiliation

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `MountainView Hospital Las Vegas "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found direct reference to the medical records page at sunrisehealthinfo.com.
2. **Web search** for `MountainView Hospital Las Vegas medical records release form request` — confirmed the form URL and provided additional context about the online request portal.
3. **Direct website navigation** to `https://www.sunrisehealthinfo.com/locations/mountainview-hospital/for-patients/medical-records` — found the authorization form links (English and Spanish).
4. **Initial curl download** from `sunrisehealthinfo.com/util/forms/...` URL returned HTML (bot blocking). Successful download from the actual CDN URL (`hcadam.com/api/public/content/...`) found on the page.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.hcadam.com/api/public/content/46695a9ba25e4b9aa6376f53cef033ac?v=b53c28b5
- **Link text on page**: "Authorization for Release of Medical Information"
- **Description**: HCA Healthcare standard authorization form for release/disclosure of medical information (English version). Multi-section form with patient info, recipient info, record types selection (consultation, discharge summary, ER report, labs, etc.), delivery format options (paper, electronic media, encrypted/unencrypted email), USCDI release option, 180-day default expiration, and HIPAA-compliant authorization language.
- **Notable features**: Includes USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release option, electronic delivery choices, and psychotherapy notes separation.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.hcadam.com/api/public/content/e109b112b80f42fc8291acbe0b1435fa?v=829b113e
- **Link text on page**: "Autorización para la divulgación de información médica"
- **Description**: Spanish-language version of the same authorization form (form-1.pdf). Identical structure and content translated to Spanish.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The original URL pattern (`sunrisehealthinfo.com/util/forms/Authorization-to-Disclose-Medical-Information.pdf`) returned HTML instead of a PDF when using curl, likely due to bot protection or URL redirect. The actual PDF was served from HCA's CDN at `hcadam.com`.
- MountainView Hospital's own domain (`mountainview-hospital.com`) redirects to the Sunrise Health system website at `sunrisehealthinfo.com`.

## Additional Notes
- The medical records page also offers an **online medical records request portal** (via Swellbox: https://www.swellbox.com/hca-healthcare-wizard.html) and the **MyHealthONE patient portal** as alternative methods to request records.
- This is a standardized HCA Healthcare form used across their system, not specific to MountainView Hospital.
- The form was easy to find — directly linked from the Medical Records page under "For Patients" navigation.

# Consensus Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name:** Consensus Health
- **Website:** https://www.consensushealth.com
- **Location:** Marlton, NJ (Cherry Hill office at 1401 Marlton Pike East, Suite 26, Cherry Hill, NJ 08034)
- **Type:** Independent physician practice network (for-profit, northeast)
- **Patient Portal:** athenahealth (https://18614-1.portal.athenahealth.com/)

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI form** — Searched for `"Consensus Health" Marlton NJ release of information authorization medical records form`. No Consensus Health–specific ROI form found.

2. **Website navigation** — Explored consensushealth.com pages: homepage, For Patients, Privacy Policy, About Us, Contact. No patient forms section or downloadable forms found on the main site.

3. **URL guessing** — Tried common paths (`/patient-forms/`, `/forms/`, `/medical-records/`, `/hipaa/`, `/authorization-form/`, `/compliance/`) on both consensushealth.com and consensuscherryhill.com. All returned 404.

4. **Site-specific search** — Searched `site:consensushealth.com` for forms, authorization, records. No results.

5. **PDF file search** — Searched `consensushealth.com filetype:pdf`. Found only Code of Ethics and Conduct PDFs and a Benefits Summary — no patient-facing forms.

6. **Cherry Hill practice site** — Navigated https://consensuscherryhill.com/ (the Marlton-area practice). Checked Patients page, Privacy Policy. No downloadable forms; only contact form and patient portal link.

7. **Skylands Medical Group** — Found https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/ (a Consensus Health member practice). Their Patient Resources page has multiple Consensus Health–branded patient forms, including a "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization" form.

8. **PatientPop search** — Found a generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" form hosted on PatientPop servers, linked in web search results about Consensus Health practices.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/223399.pdf
- **Description:** Generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" — 1 page, has text layer, no fillable fields. Not branded to Consensus Health. Found via web search associated with Consensus Health practices. Contains fields for patient info, information requested, purpose of release, and recipient. Includes HIPAA authorization language at bottom.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CMG-Form-Consent-Disclosure-and-Authorization-2022.pdf
- **Description:** "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization Form" — 2 pages, has text layer, Consensus Health branded. From Skylands Medical Group (a Consensus Health member practice). Covers general consent for treatment, acknowledgment of HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, consent to use/disclose PHI for treatment/payment/operations, designation of authorized individuals for PHI disclosure, and contact preferences. Form identifier: CMG Form 5/Version 1.0 (04/2019). This is more of a general treatment consent and PHI disclosure authorization than a patient-initiated ROI form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CMG-Form-HIPAA-Acknowledgement-2022.pdf
- **Description:** "HIPAA Acknowledgement — Notice of Privacy Practices" — 1 page, has text layer, Consensus Health branded. Simple acknowledgment of receipt of Notice of Privacy Practices. Form identifier: CMG Form 6/Version 1.0 (04/2019).

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CMG-Form-Notice-of-Privacy-2025.pdf
- **Description:** "Notice of Privacy Practices" — 7 pages, has text layer, Consensus Health branded. Comprehensive HIPAA notice covering uses/disclosures of PHI, patient rights, and contact information. Form identifier: CMG Form 7 - Version 2.0. Updated 2025 version.

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **No ROI form on main website.** The main consensushealth.com site has no patient forms section whatsoever. The "For Patients" page only describes benefits and links to the patient portal.

2. **Decentralized practice model.** Consensus Health operates as a network of independent practices. Patient forms appear to be published by individual member practices (e.g., Skylands Medical Group) rather than centrally by Consensus Health.

3. **No specific ROI/records request form.** Neither the main site nor the Skylands practice site offers a form specifically designed for patients to request their own medical records. The closest document is the general "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization" form (form-2.pdf), which authorizes the practice to use and disclose PHI but is signed at intake — not a patient-initiated records request form.

4. **Cherry Hill/Marlton practice has no forms online.** The practice closest to Marlton (consensuscherryhill.com) has no downloadable forms; they direct patients to the athenahealth patient portal or ask them to contact the office.

## Summary

Consensus Health does not appear to publish a patient-initiated Release of Information / Authorization for Medical Records form on any of its public-facing websites. The organization relies on its athenahealth patient portal for patient interactions and does not make ROI forms available for download. The most relevant form found is the general "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization" form (form-2.pdf) from a member practice, which is a treatment consent and general PHI disclosure authorization, not a records request form.

# UPMC Presbyterian — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `UPMC "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links on UPMC's DAM (Digital Asset Management) CDN.
2. **Web search** for `UPMC "medical records" "release form" PDF download` — confirmed same URLs, plus found the UPMC medical records landing page.
3. **Navigated UPMC medical records page** (`https://www.upmc.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`) — found the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page with the same form link plus a form completion guide PDF.
4. **Checked UPMC Presbyterian-specific page** (`https://www.upmc.com/locations/hospitals/presbyterian/patients-visitors/medical-records`) — confirmed the main ROI form is the system-wide UPMC form, plus found a separate "form completion guide" PDF.

## Difficulties

- None. UPMC makes their ROI form readily available. The form is linked from the system-wide medical records page and from each hospital's individual page.
- UPMC Presbyterian uses the same system-wide ROI form as other UPMC hospitals. It is not a facility-specific form.
- There is also an "In Home" version for UPMC In Home Urgent Care Plus / Home Healthcare, which is a separate form.

## Downloaded Files

# Penobscot Community Health Care — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC)
- **Website**: https://pchc.com
- **Location**: Bangor, ME
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF**: `"Penobscot Community Health Care" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — Successfully found the direct PDF URL on the first try.
2. **Web search site-scoped**: `site:pchc.com authorization release medical records` — Confirmed the same form and also found a Privacy Practices Booklet.
3. **Website navigation**: Visited https://pchc.com/healthinformation/ (Health Information Management page). This page does **not** directly link to the ROI form PDF. Instead, it directs patients to use Datavant (a third-party records management service) for web-based medical record requests. The page links to a Privacy Practices Booklet and a Specialty Referrals Worksheet, but not the authorization form itself.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://pchc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Release-of-Information-2023.pdf
- **File size**: 150,278 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization to Disclose Health Information form
- **Fillable fields**: None (flat PDF, Form: none)
- **PDF version**: 1.6
- **Created**: Sep 25, 2023; Modified: Mar 27, 2024
- **Notes**: This is PCHC's "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" form (Rev. 06/01/2023, MRC001). It covers both disclosure TO and obtaining FROM third parties. Includes sections for sensitive health information (mental health, substance use disorder under 42 CFR Part 2, HIV/AIDS). Offers delivery by mail (on CD), fax, email (via secure portal), or verbal communication. Authorization expires 30 months from signature. Not a fillable PDF — designed for print-and-sign.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://pchc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/release-of-information-2023.pdf
- **File size**: 150,296 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Same ROI form as form-1.pdf (identical text content)
- **Notes**: This is the same form hosted at a different URL path. The text content is identical to form-1.pdf, but the files have different MD5 checksums and different modification dates (this one was last modified Sep 25, 2023 vs. Mar 27, 2024 for form-1.pdf). Likely the original upload location before being re-uploaded to a newer path.

## Difficulties
- The ROI form is **not directly linked** from the Health Information Management page (https://pchc.com/healthinformation/). Patients visiting that page are directed to use Datavant's web portal for records requests instead. The PDF form exists on the server but finding it requires knowing the URL or using a search engine.
- No fillable form fields — patients must print, fill by hand, and submit.

## Additional Observations
- PCHC uses **Datavant** (https://www.swellbox.com/pchc-wizard.html) as their third-party information management service for processing medical records requests.
- The HIM page also links to a Privacy Practices Booklet (2025 version) at https://pchc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Privacy_Practices_Booklet_01_01_2025.pdf
- The form is well-structured with clear sections for patient info, recipient info, delivery method, record types, sensitive information, purpose, and duration.

# Cuba Memorial Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: Cuba Memorial Hospital
- **Location**: Cuba, NY 14727
- **Website**: https://www.cubamemorialhospital.com
- **Type**: Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit, Northeast
- **Parent/Affiliated System**: Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) — part of Kaleida Health; linked to Olean General Hospital (OGH) and Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC) via https://www.brmc-ogh.org/

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web search for Cuba Memorial Hospital ROI form (unsuccessful)
- Searched for `"Cuba Memorial Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF`
- Searched for `site:cubamemorialhospital.com authorization release medical records`
- Searched for `"Cuba Memorial Hospital" "release of information" OR "medical records request" form filetype:pdf`
- **Result**: No direct PDF form found. Web search results consistently indicated no downloadable form on their website.

### 2. Cuba Memorial Hospital website navigation (no form found)
- Navigated to https://www.cubamemorialhospital.com
- Checked the site map page — no medical records or forms page listed
- Checked the HIPAA Notice page — mentions right to access records but no downloadable form
- The Patient Portal page (YourHEALTH) provides electronic access to records but no ROI form
- **Result**: The Cuba Memorial Hospital website does not publish an ROI/authorization form. It's a small site focused on services, with no dedicated medical records or patient forms section.

### 3. Parent organization BRMC-OGH site (successful)
- Cuba Memorial Hospital's footer links to "BRMC-OGH Site" at https://www.brmc-ogh.org/
- The BRMC-OGH homepage banner mentions "For medical records, visit our medical records page"
- Navigated to https://www.brmc-ogh.org/visitors/medical-records/
- **Found two ROI forms** under "Information Release Forms" heading:
  - "Release of information form – OGH (pdf)" — Olean General Hospital form
  - "Release of information form – BRMC (pdf)" — Bradford Regional Medical Center form
- Both hosted on Tiny Cloud drive (CMS file hosting)

### 4. Kaleida Health parent search (not needed)
- Searched for Kaleida Health-level forms but found none beyond what BRMC-OGH provided
- The BRMC-OGH site forms appear to be the standard forms used across the Upper Allegheny Health System

## Downloaded Forms

- **Found on page**: https://www.brmc-ogh.org/visitors/medical-records/
- **Link text**: "Release of information form – OGH (pdf)"
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization form — "AUTHORIZATION FOR PATIENT ACCESS AND/OR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION"
- **Org on form**: Olean General Hospital, Upper Allegheny Health System, 515 Main Street, Olean, NY 14760
- **Pages**: 2
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Form number**: 3208105, Revised 01/20/2017
- **Notes**: This is the most relevant form for Cuba Memorial Hospital since both are part of UAHS and located in New York. The form includes checkboxes for specific record types, sections for patient access (inspection/copies), 90-day expiration, and specially protected information consent (HIV, mental health, substance abuse). Requires photo ID for pickup.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/fma0ckgi8l71unwv372o9bkc28qzcn65s72m80cndsw3awok/61c90625-dd5b-4e4e-81c2-70e000fb6a31
- **Found on page**: https://www.brmc-ogh.org/visitors/medical-records/
- **Link text**: "Release of information form – BRMC (pdf)"
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization form — same title as form-1
- **Org on form**: Bradford Regional Medical Center, Bradford, PA 16701
- **Pages**: 2
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Form number**: 3004200, Revised 01/20/2017
- **Notes**: Nearly identical to form-1 but for BRMC in Pennsylvania. The disclosing organization field is blank (not pre-filled) unlike the OGH version. Included since BRMC is part of the same system.

## Difficulties Encountered
- Cuba Memorial Hospital does not publish any ROI or authorization forms on its own website
- The hospital website is relatively small with no dedicated patient forms or medical records section
- The connection to the BRMC-OGH system (and thus to downloadable forms) was found through a footer link on the Cuba Memorial Hospital website
- Neither form specifically mentions Cuba Memorial Hospital — they are system-level forms for OGH and BRMC
- The Cuba Memorial Hospital website directs patients to the YourHEALTH patient portal for health record access, but provides no downloadable authorization forms

## Retrieval Difficulty: Moderate
The form is not on Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website. It required recognizing the affiliation with the BRMC-OGH system via a footer link, navigating to the parent organization's medical records page, and inferring that the OGH form would be the applicable one for a UAHS facility in New York.

# Bath Community Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Bath Community Hospital
- **Website:** https://bathhospital.org/
- **Location:** Hot Springs, VA
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Bath Community Hospital Hot Springs VA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — initial search did not find a direct hospital-specific form but pointed to the hospital website.
2. **Web search** for `Bath Community Hospital Hot Springs Virginia medical records release form` — found a direct link to the Medical Records Request PDF at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf`.
3. **Website navigation** — visited `https://bathhospital.org/patient-resources/forms/` which lists forms under "Medical Records Request" heading. The link at `https://bathhospital.org/medical-records-request/` redirects directly to the PDF.
4. **Site-specific search** for additional HIPAA authorization forms on bathhospital.org — no additional ROI forms found.
5. **Checked adult new patient packet** — contains a general "Release of Information" consent section as part of intake paperwork (for treatment/payment/operations), but is not a standalone ROI form for requesting medical records.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf
- **Document type:** Medical Records Request / Release of Information form
- **Initial impression:** This is a one-page ROI form branded as "Bath Community Physicians Group" (the affiliated physician practice), not specifically "Bath Community Hospital." It is located at 713 S Monroe Ave, Covington, VA 24426. The form allows patients to authorize sending or receiving records, with checkboxes for record types (ER notes, H&P, operative reports, lab/test results, imaging reports, discharge summary, complete medical record). It includes consent for alcohol/drug abuse/psychiatric records release, a 6-month expiration clause, and requires patient/guardian signature plus a witness signature. The form appears to be a scanned/image-based PDF with OCR text layer (some OCR artifacts like "ERNOTE" instead of "ER NOTE" and "IMAGINE" instead of "IMAGING"). It is not fillable.

## Difficulties
- The hospital's only ROI form is branded under "Bath Community Physicians Group" rather than "Bath Community Hospital" itself. This is common for small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative resources.
- The form appears to be a scan with OCR, not a digitally-created document, evidenced by minor OCR errors in the extracted text.
- Only one ROI-related form was found on the entire website.

# WakeMed Health & Hospitals — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `WakeMed "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately returned the correct page and a direct PDF URL.
2. **Web search** for `WakeMed "medical records" "release form"` — confirmed the same page and provided a direct link to the English PDF.
3. **Initial direct PDF URL** (`/assets/documents/patients-and-visitors/roi-authorization-eng.pdf`) returned HTML instead of a PDF (likely an outdated/redirected URL).
4. **Browser navigation** to the HIM page (`/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/health-information-management-him`) revealed the current PDF URLs under `/sites/default/files/pdf/`.
5. **curl download** of the correct URLs succeeded without bot blocking.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.wakemed.org/sites/default/files/pdf/N-935%20Authorization%20to%20Release%20Medical%20Information%20(1).pdf`
- **Document**: Authorization to Release Medical Information (English)
- **Pages**: 2
- **File size**: 73,867 bytes
- **Description**: WakeMed's official ROI form (English version). Includes fields for patient info, recipient info, dates of visit, specific record types (office visits, hospital admission, ED visit, immunizations, imaging, etc.), format options (paper or electronic copy), and delivery method (mail, fax, pick up, onsite review, MyChart, or email). Has text layer with selectable text. Not a fillable PDF (checkboxes and fields are text-based, not interactive form fields).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.wakemed.org/sites/default/files/pdf/N-935S%20Authorization%20to%20Release%20Medical%20Information.pdf`
- **Document**: Authorization to Release Medical Information (Spanish)
- **Pages**: 2
- **File size**: 76,260 bytes
- **Description**: Spanish-language version of the same ROI form. Same structure and content as the English version, translated into Spanish. Some fields (like "Address where you want your PHI sent to" and "Email address") remain in English.

## Difficulties

- The first PDF URL found via web search (`/assets/documents/patients-and-visitors/roi-authorization-eng.pdf`) was stale and returned HTML instead of a PDF. Had to use the browser to navigate to the actual HIM page to get the current URLs.
- No other significant difficulties. The forms were easy to find — linked directly from the Health Information Management page under Patients and Visitors.

## Findability Assessment

The form is located at: Patients and Visitors → Medical Records → Health Information Management (HIM). It is clearly labeled and linked in both English and Spanish. The page also explains the process for requesting records, fees, and contact information. Moderate findability — requires navigating through a few levels of the site hierarchy, but the page is well-organized.

# Northwest Colorado Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Northwest Colorado Health
- **Location:** Steamboat Springs, CO
- **Type:** FQHC, independent, nonprofit
- **Website:** https://northwestcoloradohealth.org

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release form PDF** — first search did not return a direct link but confirmed the organization exists.
2. **Web search scoped to site:northwestcoloradohealth.org** — successfully found two distinct ROI forms and the patient forms page.
3. **Patient forms page:** https://northwestcoloradohealth.org/what_you_can_do/patient-resources/patient-forms/english.html — this is where both forms are linked.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://northwestcoloradohealth.org/file_download/inline/2f9a888a-2c02-465a-944d-2573dcc8583c
- **File size:** 606,501 bytes
- **Document type:** Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information — **Behavioral Health** version
- **Description:** Single-page ROI form specifically for behavioral health records. Includes sections for patient info, from/to entities, record types, substance abuse/mental health/psychotherapy notes authorization, signature, and standard HIPAA disclaimers. Has text layer (not a scan). Flat PDF without fillable fields. Expires two years from last date of service.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://northwestcoloradohealth.org/file_download/inline/47f874e3-3d56-4e17-934f-11105ae813ba
- **File size:** 608,748 bytes
- **Document type:** Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information — **Medical and/or Dental** version
- **Description:** Single-page ROI form for medical and dental records. Very similar layout to form-1 but covers medical/dental records with HIV-related information authorization instead of psychotherapy notes. Same structure: patient info, from/to, record types, purpose of disclosure, signature, and HIPAA disclaimers. Has text layer. Flat PDF without fillable fields.

## Observations

- Northwest Colorado Health uses **two separate ROI forms** — one for behavioral health and one for medical/dental records. Patients needing both would need to complete two forms.
- Both forms note that if a patient saw a provider in the other category for substance abuse, a second release form is required.
- Forms are **not fillable** (no interactive PDF fields) — designed to be printed and filled by hand.
- Both forms reference "Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association" as the legacy name in the revocation section, suggesting the organization was previously known by that name.
- Processing time is stated as up to 48 business hours.
- Authorization expires two years from last date of service.
- Forms were easy to find via web search and are publicly accessible on the patient forms page.

## Difficulties
- No significant difficulties. Forms were publicly available and downloaded without any bot blocking or authentication requirements.

Flat PDF with text layer but no fillable fields.
- **Note:** An identical copy exists at a different URL on the Patient Forms page (https://www.alabamamedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Request-for-Release-of-Information-Form-1.pdf) — same MD5 hash, not downloaded separately.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.alabamamedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PERMISSION-TO-GIVE-MEDICAL-INFORMATION-2.pdf
- **Found on page:** https://www.alabamamedicalgroup.com/patient-resources/other-patient-forms/
- **File size:** 117,159 bytes
- **Document type:** Permission/consent form for sharing medical information with family members
- **Description:** "Permission to Give Medical Information" form. Allows listing up to 3 family members authorized to receive medical information by phone. Includes acknowledgment of receiving Notice of Privacy Practices. Short, simple form — not a full ROI authorization but related to information disclosure.

## Other Forms on Patient Forms Page (not downloaded)
- **Report of Medical History** (AMG-Patient-info-form.pdf) — patient intake form, not ROI-related
- **Notice of Privacy Practices** (Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf) — privacy notice, not ROI form

## Difficulties
- None significant. Forms were straightforward to find and download. The website is well-organized with a clear Patient Resources > Medical Records section.
- The same ROI form is hosted at two different URLs (uploaded in Feb 2018 and Mar 2018), but the files are byte-for-byte identical.
- Forms are flat PDFs (no fillable fields), designed for print-and-fill workflow.

# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Hillcrest Hospital Claremore
- **Location:** Claremore, OK
- **Website:** https://hillcrest.com/locations/hillcrest-hospital-claremore
- **Parent System:** Hillcrest HealthCare System (part of Ardent Health Services)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs:** Searched `"Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct results for Claremore-specific form.
2. **Web search for release forms:** Searched `"Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — no direct results.
3. **Site-scoped search:** Searched `site:hillcrest.com authorization release medical records` — found the system-wide Medical Records Request page at https://hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/. This was the most productive strategy.
4. **Parent system website navigation:** The Medical Records Request page on hillcrest.com serves all Hillcrest HealthCare System facilities, including Hillcrest Hospital Claremore (explicitly listed in the sidebar and on the form itself).

## What Worked
The site-scoped web search led to the Hillcrest HealthCare System's centralized Medical Records Request page, which provides:
- MyChart portal access for electronic records requests
- An online request platform via Swellbox (https://www.swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html)
- A downloadable paper ROI form (PDF)

The paper ROI form is a system-wide form with checkboxes for each facility, including Hillcrest Hospital Claremore.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://hillcrestinternal.com/forms/Record%20Authorization%20Form_Final.pdf
- **What it is:** Authorization for Release of Medical Information form for **Hillcrest Internal Medicine** in San Diego, CA (619 area code). This is a completely unrelated organization — not part of Hillcrest HealthCare System in Oklahoma.
- **File size:** 302,223 bytes
- **Note:** Downloaded as a search result from web queries mentioning "Hillcrest." Kept per study protocol but not relevant to Hillcrest Hospital Claremore.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://hillcrest.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/12/ROI.Current.English.HMC1072.pdf
- **What it is:** The official **Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information** form for the Hillcrest HealthCare System. This is the correct ROI form. It lists all system facilities with checkboxes, including Hillcrest Hospital Claremore. 2 pages, has text layer, appears to be a digitally-created form (not a scan).
- **File size:** 136,435 bytes
- **Key features:** Facility selection checkboxes, record type options (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, Progress Notes, X-ray reports, ER Record, Consultation, Lab reports), purpose options, 6-month auto-expiration, patient signature line.

## Difficulties
- No Claremore-specific ROI form exists; the system uses a single form across all facilities.
- One search result (hillcrestfamilymedicine.com) had an SSL error preventing download; this turned out to be an unrelated organization anyway.
- The correct form was straightforward to find once navigating the parent system's website.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The form is linked from the system-wide Medical Records Request page under "Policies and Disclosures," accessible in 2-3 clicks from the main website.

# Fenway Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Fenway Health
- **Location:** Boston, MA
- **Type:** FQHC, independent, nonprofit
- **Website:** https://fenwayhealth.org

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF directly** — `"Fenway Health" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return direct results.
2. **Web search for medical records form** — `"Fenway Health" Boston "medical records" "release form" OR "authorization form"` — **successful**. Found the direct PDF URL and the medical records page at https://fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/.
3. **Site-scoped search** — `site:fenwayhealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the form URL and also surfaced a FAQ sheet PDF.
4. **Spanish version search** — found a separate Spanish-language version of the ROI form.

## What Worked
The second web search was the most effective, immediately returning the direct PDF URL for the English ROI form, the FAQ sheet, and the medical records landing page. Fenway Health makes their forms readily accessible on a dedicated medical records page.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FHROIForm10202025.pdf
- **File size:** 205,305 bytes
- **Description:** Fenway Health Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (English). This is the primary ROI form. It includes sections for patient information, sender/recipient details, reason for release, type of information to disclose, sensitive information categories (requiring initials), and legal notice/signature. The form has a text layer and appears to be a digitally-created PDF (not a scan). It includes specific protections for reproductive health care and gender-affirming care, reflecting Massachusetts law.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ReleaseofInformationFAQSheet.pdf
- **File size:** 87,588 bytes
- **Description:** ROI Form FAQ Sheet — a companion guide that explains each section of the ROI form in detail. It provides instructions for patients on how to correctly fill out each field, explains the different options for reason for release, type of information, and sensitive information categories. Not an ROI form itself, but a helpful patient-facing document that accompanies the form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ReleaseofInformationMedicalRecordsFormSpanish10312025.pdf
- **File size:** 226,856 bytes
- **Description:** Spanish-language version of the ROI form (Autorización de Fenway Health Para Divulgar Información De Salud Protegida). Same structure as form-1.pdf but fully translated into Spanish.

## Difficulties Encountered
- None. Forms were easy to find and download without any bot-blocking or access barriers.

## Additional Observations
- Fenway Health has a dedicated medical records page (https://fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/) with clear instructions for submitting the form via fax, email, or mail.
- The form can also be submitted through the MyChart patient portal.
- Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (per the FAQ sheet).
- The form includes robust protections for sensitive health information categories, requiring explicit patient initials for each category (behavioral health, HIV/AIDS, substance use, genetic testing, abortion care, etc.).
- The form explicitly addresses gender-affirming care protections under Massachusetts law.

# Rio Grande Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Rio Grande Hospital
- **Location:** Del Norte, CO
- **Website:** https://riograndehospital.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Rio Grande Hospital Del Norte Colorado "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — did not return the direct PDF but pointed to the hospital website.
2. **Web search** with `site:riograndehospital.org medical records release authorization form` — found three key URLs:
   - Hospital Patient Records Release Form page
   - Clinic Authorization for Release of Information page
   - Direct PDF download link
3. **HTML inspection** of both the hospital and clinic records release pages to identify embedded forms and PDF links.

## What Was Found

Rio Grande Hospital provides two pathways for medical records release authorization:

1. **Downloadable PDF form** — A single-page "Authorization for Release of Information" PDF available at a direct URL. This is the same PDF linked from both the hospital and clinic pages.
2. **Online JotForm submissions** — Both the hospital page and clinic page embed different HIPAA-compliant JotForms for online submission:
   - Hospital JotForm ID: 220685534838162
   - Clinic JotForm ID: 220685679526166

The hospital and clinic pages also link to additional patient forms (Patient Information Form, Consent Form, Privacy Policy, etc.) but those are not ROI forms.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://riograndehospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AuthorizationForReleaseOfInformation.pdf
- **Found via:** Web search pointing to the hospital website
- **Document type:** Authorization for Release of Information (ROI form)
- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 441,787 bytes (442 KB)
- **Has text layer:** Yes
- **Fillable fields:** None (flat PDF, not interactive)
- **Created:** May 2, 2018 (Microsoft Word 2013)
- **Content summary:** Standard ROI form requesting patient name, SSN, DOB, address, from/to information, checkboxes for record types (History/Physical, Lab Results, X-Ray Reports, Other Diagnostic Reports) with date fields, HIV/STD/AIDS release authorization, purpose checkboxes (Continued Care, Insurance, Attorney/Legal, Disability/SS, Personal, Other), revocation language, 1-year expiration, and signature line. Includes office-use-only section for tracking fax/mail/release.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The PDF was directly downloadable and the website clearly organizes its patient forms.
- The hospital and clinic pages primarily feature embedded JotForms for online submission rather than downloadable PDFs; the downloadable PDF is in the sidebar.
- Only one PDF version of the ROI form exists — the same form is shared between hospital and clinic contexts.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The form was findable via web search and clearly linked from the hospital website's patient forms pages.

# Saratoga Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for filetype:pdf** — `"Saratoga Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return direct results.
2. **Web search for medical records release form** — `Saratoga Hospital Saratoga Springs NY medical records release form` — **this worked**, returning a direct link to the Saratoga Hospital-specific authorization form hosted on albanymed.org.
3. **Site-scoped search** — `site:saratogahospital.org authorization release medical records` — returned the same albanymed.org-hosted form (Saratoga Hospital's site redirects to albanymed.org as part of the Albany Med Health System).
4. **Browsed the Albany Med "Requesting Medical Records" page** — Found the system-wide AMHS authorization form and confirmed Saratoga Hospital is one of four hospitals in the Albany Med Health System.

## Key Finding

Saratoga Hospital is part of the **Albany Med Health System**. The original saratogahospital.org domain now redirects to albanymed.org/saratoga/. The medical records page (albanymed.org/patients-visitors/requesting-medical-records/) provides a unified system-wide authorization form covering all four hospitals (Albany Medical Center, Columbia Memorial Health, Glens Falls Hospital, and Saratoga Hospital). An older Saratoga Hospital–specific form also remains available.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.albanymed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/SH_Auth-to-Disclose-PHI_2020_Electronic-Form.pdf
- **File size**: 98,869 bytes
- **Document type**: Saratoga Hospital–specific "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" (Form 4202, dated 2020)
- **Description**: Single-page form with Saratoga Hospital branding (211 Church Street address). Includes patient info fields, record type checkboxes, disclosure recipient, delivery method options (pick-up, mail, email, fax), HIPAA/HIV disclosure language, and signature line. Notes a $0.75/page copy fee (waived for physician-to-physician transfers). Authorization defaults to 90-day expiry.
- **Text layer**: Yes (extractable text)
- **Fillable fields**: Appears to be an electronic form based on filename ("Electronic-Form")

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.albanymed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/24_AMHS_Authorization-to-Disclose-PHI_V2-1.pdf
- **File size**: 114,399 bytes
- **Document type**: Albany Med Health System–wide "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" (2024 version, V2)
- **Description**: Multi-field form covering all four AMHS hospitals. More comprehensive than form-1: includes checkboxes for which hospital to release from, broader record type options (billing, ER, urgent care, primary care, specialty), sensitive information categories with separate initials (alcohol/drug, mental health, HIV, genetic testing), and recipient/purpose sections. This is the current form linked from the Requesting Medical Records page.
- **Text layer**: Yes (extractable text)
- **Initial impression**: This is the current/active system-wide ROI form that patients would use

## Difficulties

- **No difficulties encountered.** The form was easy to find via web search and the Albany Med website. Both PDFs downloaded without any bot blocking or authentication requirements.
- The main complexity is that Saratoga Hospital has been absorbed into the Albany Med Health System, so both an older hospital-specific form and a newer system-wide form exist.

# NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately surfaced the NYP medical records page and several direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for "site:nyp.org authorization release medical records" — confirmed URLs and revealed campus-specific forms (Lawrence, Jay Monahan Center).
3. **Navigated to** https://www.nyp.org/patients-visitors/medical-records — the main medical records page. This was the authoritative source for all forms. Easy to find: Home → Patients & Visitors → Medical Records (2 clicks).

The medical records page offers:
- Electronic submission via Verisma portal (separate links for Patient, Patient Representative, Attorney)
- Paper authorization form (the "Tripartite" NYP/Columbia/Weill Cornell consortium form) available in English, Spanish, and Chinese via nyp.widen.net
- An FAQ document about obtaining medical records

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://nyp.widen.net/content/tfeix7vzfw/original/Tripartite-ROI-HIPAA-Authorization_English.pdf (linked from main medical records page as paper form)
- **Size**: 141,180 bytes
- **Description**: "NY Consortium HIPAA Auth" — the main Tripartite ROI/HIPAA Authorization form shared across NYP, Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). 2-page form covering patient info, recipient info, request reason, disclosing entity selection (all NYP campuses plus outpatient/physician offices), information to be released (with checkboxes for specific record types), sensitive information authorization (alcohol/drug, HIV/AIDS, mental health, genetic testing), release method options (paper, fax, email, CD, flash drive, patient portal), and authorization/signature section. Rev. 10/2/2019.
- **Initial impression**: This is the primary ROI authorization form for the entire NYP system.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.nyp.org/sites/default/files/acquiadam/2020-08/faq-for-obtaining-medical-records.pdf
- **Size**: 355,228 bytes
- **Description**: "Frequently Asked Questions – Release of Information: How to Obtain Copies of My Medical Records?" — 2-page FAQ document explaining how patients can request their records, where to find the form, submission methods, response timelines, fees, etc.
- **Initial impression**: Not an ROI form itself, but a supplementary FAQ document about the ROI process.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.nyp.org/documents/lawrence/patients-visitors/auth-to-disclose-phi-lawrence.pdf
- **Size**: 257,716 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information/Medical Records" — appears to be an older or campus-specific version of the authorization form (Lawrence campus path in URL). Similar content to form-1 but different layout. Lists NYP campus options including Columbia, Weill Cornell, Westchester, Lower Manhattan, Lawrence, and Other.
- **Initial impression**: A variant/older version of the ROI authorization form, possibly campus-specific to NYP/Lawrence.

## Difficulties Encountered

- The main paper form (form-1) was hosted on nyp.widen.net (a DAM platform). The initial link (https://nyp.widen.net/s/qgjgxkfrwp/tripartite-roi-hipaa-authorization_english) served an HTML landing page with an embedded PDF viewer, not the raw PDF. Had to use browser to extract the actual PDF download URL.
- NYP also offers electronic submission via Verisma portal (vra.verisma.com) which is a web-based form completion system, not a downloadable PDF. These are the preferred/primary method per the website.
- Overall, findability was straightforward — the medical records page is easily accessible and well-organized.

# Hartford Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Hartford Hospital
- **Website:** https://hartfordhospital.org
- **Location:** Hartford, CT
- **Parent System:** Hartford HealthCare (regional system, nonprofit)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Hartford Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — returned multiple direct PDF links across Hartford HealthCare domains.
2. **Web search** for `Hartford Hospital Connecticut "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same forms and pointed to the parent system's medical records page.
3. **Navigated** Hartford HealthCare's medical records page at `https://hartfordhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/patients/medical-records` — found the canonical links under "Release of Information forms" heading.

The parent system (Hartford HealthCare) manages ROI centrally. The medical records page on hartfordhealthcare.org is the main landing page, with links to all facility-specific HIM departments and a single system-wide authorization form.

## Difficulties

- The URL `https://hartfordhealthcare.org/-/media/files/patients-visitors/patients/hhc-authorization-to-release-form-english.pdf` returned a **404 page** (HTML). This appears to be an older/deprecated URL that search results still reference.
- The correct current URL for the system-wide form is `https://hartfordhealthcare.org/file%20library/forms/571559.pdf`.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://hartfordhealthcare.org/file%20library/forms/571559.pdf
- **Found via:** Hartford HealthCare medical records page, linked as "Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information (English)"
- **Document type:** ROI / Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information
- **Form number:** HH Forms 571559 Rev. 11-2022
- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** System-wide Hartford HealthCare authorization form. Covers all HHC facilities including Hartford Hospital, Institute of Living, Backus, Charlotte Hungerford, HOCC, MidState, Natchaug, Rushford, St. Vincent's, Windham, and HHCMG. Includes checkboxes for record types, method of disclosure (mail, verbal, pick-up, review, electronic, MyChartPlus, fax), and special protections for HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, and reproductive health records under Connecticut law.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://hartfordhospital.org/File%20Library/Hartford%20Hospital%20Forms/Consent%20Forms/Release%20of%20Medical%20Records/573008.pdf
- **Found via:** Web search results
- **Document type:** ROI / Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information (Institute of Living variant)
- **Form number:** 104507 (form 573008)
- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** Institute of Living–specific authorization form. Has separate columns for "FILL OUT FOR INSTITUTE OF LIVING TO DISCLOSE" and "FILL OUT FOR INSTITUTE OF LIVING TO OBTAIN." Appears to be an older or specialized variant for the psychiatric facility within Hartford Hospital.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://hartfordhealthcaremedicalgroup.org/file%20library/forms/medical-records-release-form.pdf
- **Found via:** Web search results (Hartford HealthCare Medical Group site)
- **Document type:** ROI / Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information
- **Form number:** HH Forms 571559 Rev. 11-2022
- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** Same form as form-1 (571559), hosted on the Hartford HealthCare Medical Group website. Text content is identical; files differ slightly in size/encoding (448KB vs 453KB) but are functionally the same form.

## Summary
Hartford Hospital uses the Hartford HealthCare system-wide ROI form (571559). The form is relatively easy to find — the medical records page is well-organized and clearly links to the authorization form. There's also an older Institute of Living–specific variant (573008) still available. The system uses a single form across all its facilities with a checkbox to select which HIM department should receive the completed authorization.

### 2. Website Navigation (Browser)
Browsed the following pages on neshobageneral.com:
- Home page
- Patient & Visitors landing page
- Patient Information page
- Case Management page
- Financial Services page
- Community Resources page
- Patient Portal Info page
- Privacy Policy page
- Site Map page

### 3. Common PDF URL Guessing
Tried common document paths like:

- `/documents/release-of-information.pdf`
- `/documents/medical-records-release.pdf`
- `/documents/authorization-form.pdf`
- `/documents/ROI-form.pdf`
- `/documents/HIPAA-Authorization.pdf`
- And several other variants

**Result**: All returned 404.

### 4. Wayback Machine / Internet Archive
Searched the Wayback Machine CDX API for all PDFs ever indexed from neshobageneral.com. Found only 9 unique PDFs:
1. `CHNA_Final_Report_June_28-_2018.pdf` — Community Health Needs Assessment
2. `Employer-Authorization-Form_Fillable.pdf` — Employer authorization for occupational health services

7. `Visitation-Policy-09012021.pdf` — Older visitation policy
8. `wash-your-hands-fact-sheet-508.pdf` — Hand washing info
9. `Nurse-C-Center-COVID.pdf` — COVID nurse call center flyer

**Result**: No ROI form has ever been indexed on their website.

### 5. Third-Party Services
- Checked MedicalRecords.com listing — no form available, only reviews
- Searched for third-party ROI vendors (Ciox, MRO, Datavant, HealthMark, Verisma) — no association found

## Downloaded PDFs

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.neshobageneral.com/documents/Employer-Authorization-Form_Fillable.pdf
- **What it is**: Employer Authorization Form for occupational health services (DOT physicals, pre-employment physicals, return to work physicals). This is NOT an ROI/medical records release form — it is a form employers use to authorize employee visits for workplace-related medical services.
- **Why downloaded**: It was the closest thing to an "authorization form" found on the site. Downloaded for completeness.

## Conclusion

**No ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form was found online for Neshoba General Hospital.** The hospital does not publish any patient-facing medical records release form on their website. The website has no dedicated "Medical Records" or "Health Information Management" page. The only way to obtain an ROI form appears to be by contacting the hospital directly by phone at (601) 663-1200 or visiting in person.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The hospital's website is minimal, built by Scorpion Healthcare Marketing, and lacks many standard patient resources sections
- No "Medical Records" or "HIM" department page exists
- No HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices PDF is published on the website (only a generic website privacy policy)
- The hospital is independent (not part of a larger system) so there's no parent system website to check
- The patient portal (Cerner/HealtheLife) is behind login and doesn't provide downloadable forms publicly

# WellSpan York Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "WellSpan York Hospital authorization release health information form PDF"** — Immediately returned a direct link to the main WellSpan ROI form hosted on wellspan.org.
2. **Web search for "WellSpan medical records release form PDF"** — Confirmed the same form and also surfaced a second form used by WellSpan's neighborhood hospitals.
3. **Web search for "site:wellspan.org authorization release medical records"** — Confirmed both forms and provided context about the Medical Records and Patient Forms pages.

WellSpan York Hospital is part of the WellSpan Health system, so forms are published at the system level on wellspan.org rather than on a hospital-specific site.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.wellspan.org/-/media/Project/Wellspan-Site-Tenant/wellspan-site/data/media/files/Notices-and-Forms/Disclose-Health-Info.pdf?sc_lang=en
- **File size:** 140,558 bytes
- **Document title:** "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information"
- **Description:** This is the main WellSpan Health ROI form (form #WROI0001). It is a general authorization form for use/disclosure of health information, applicable across WellSpan facilities including York Hospital. It includes fields for patient info, obtain-from/disclose-to parties, date range, record types (abstract, diagnostic tests, imaging, billing, complete record), purpose, and delivery format options (paper, CD, fax, email via secure portal). It addresses sensitive records (behavioral health, HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder, genetics, reproductive health). Has text layer; appears to be a digitally-created PDF.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.wellspan.org/-/media/Project/Wellspan-Site-Tenant/wellspan-site/data/media/files/Patient-Resources/Neighborhood-Hospitals/Authorization-for-Release-of-PHI---English.pdf
- **File size:** 211,250 bytes
- **Document title:** "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information"
- **Description:** This is a separate ROI form specifically for WellSpan's neighborhood hospitals (Newberry, Shrewsbury, Carlisle). It has checkboxes for facility selection, detailed record type checkboxes (entire clinical record, discharge summary, lab reports, EKG, nurses notes, ED report, consultation reports, H&P, physician orders, medication admin records, physician progress reports, psychiatric/psychological evaluation, radiology, pathology, abstract, billing). Includes opt-out for sensitive info (drug/alcohol, HIV, mental health). Has a 6-month default expiration. Has text layer; digitally-created PDF.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **None.** Both forms were easily discoverable via web search and downloaded without issues (no bot blocking, no login walls, no JavaScript rendering required). The forms are publicly hosted as direct PDF links on WellSpan's website.

## Summary

WellSpan Health publishes two ROI authorization forms: a primary system-wide form (form-1.pdf) and a neighborhood hospitals-specific form (form-2.pdf). Both are publicly available, have text layers, and were straightforward to find and download. The primary form (form-1.pdf) is the one most applicable to WellSpan York Hospital.

1. **Web search** for `Lincoln Hospital Davenport WA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — generic results, no direct hit.
2. **Web search** for `Lincoln Hospital Davenport Washington "medical records" "release form" PDF` — **found direct Cloudinary-hosted PDF links** for both the hospital and clinics forms, plus a link to the Health Records page.
3. **Site-specific search** `site:lincolnhospital.org medical records release authorization form` — confirmed two forms (hospital and clinics versions) and revealed an alternate clinics form URL.
4. **Browsed the Health Records page** at `https://www.lincolnhospital.org/patients-and-visitors/health-records/` — confirmed two forms are linked under a "Forms" heading. Page is straightforward — 2 clicks from homepage (Patients and Visitors → Health Records).

# Bayshore Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Bayshore Medical Center
- **Location**: 727 North Beers St., Holmdel, NJ 07730
- **Parent System**: Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH)
- **Website**: https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/locations/bayshore-medical-center

## Search Strategies

### What was tried
1. **Web search** for `"Bayshore Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct Bayshore-specific PDF found.
2. **Web search** for `Hackensack Meridian Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found HMHMG (Medical Group) form and Pascack Valley forms.
3. **Web search** for `site:hackensackmeridianhealth.org authorization release medical records form` — found the system-wide Medical Records page.
4. **Navigated** to Bayshore Medical Center's Patient & Visitor Information page → "Medical Records" accordion → links to system-wide HMH Medical Records page.
5. **Navigated** to HMH system-wide Medical Records page (`/en/patients-and-visitors/medical-records`) — found:
   - "Request Records" → Swellbox/Datavant online wizard (primary English pathway)
   - "Spanish" → Spanish ROI PDF (CMR-003S)
   - "Records Amendment" → Amendment form PDF
   - No English ROI PDF linked directly
6. **URL guessing** based on Spanish form URL pattern — all returned 500.
7. **Web search** for English CMR-003 form — found it hosted under the Medical Group patient forms path.
8. **Checked** Pascack Valley Medical Center (HMH sister facility with separate website) for comparison forms.

### What worked
- The English hospital-level ROI form (CMR-003) was found via web search pointing to the HMH Media path under Medical Group patient forms. It was **not** linked from the main Medical Records page, which only offers the Spanish version as a PDF download.
- The primary English pathway for record requests is the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard.

## Difficulties Encountered
1. **No English ROI PDF linked from main Medical Records page**: The HMH system-wide Medical Records page links to the Spanish ROI form but not the English version. English users are directed to the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard instead.
2. **Form found via indirect path**: The English CMR-003 form was hosted under the Medical Group patient forms directory path, not the patients-visitors directory where the Spanish version lives.
3. **Multiple form types**: HMH has separate forms for the Medical Group (outpatient) vs. hospital-level records, and sister facilities (Pascack Valley) have their own forms on a separately managed website.

## Summary
Bayshore Medical Center uses the Hackensack Meridian Health system-wide ROI form (CMR-003). The primary form (form-6.pdf) is a well-designed 2-page authorization that covers all HMH hospitals including Bayshore, offers electronic delivery options, and notably includes an EHI Export option for machine-readable records. However, the English PDF version is not easily discoverable from the main Medical Records page — patients are primarily directed to an online wizard (Swellbox/Datavant) for English record requests.

# Proliance Surgeons — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search**: `Proliance Surgeons release of information authorization medical records form` — immediately surfaced two PDF URLs (one from npsmri.com, one from proliancesurgeons.com) and the main medical records page.
2. **Site-scoped search**: `site:proliancesurgeons.com medical records release authorization form PDF` — found two additional forms (an incoming records request form and a ProOrtho subsidiary form).

Both searches were highly productive. No need to navigate the website manually or use browser tools.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://npsmri.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Proliance-Release-of-Information.pdf
- **File size**: 24,078 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: Image-only scan (JBIG2 compressed, no text layer) of what appears to be a Proliance Surgeons ROI form. Hosted on npsmri.com (Northwest Physicians Specialists / MRI, a Proliance member practice).
- **Notes**: No extractable text. Appears to be a scanned version of the same or similar form as form-2 and form-4.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://proliancesurgeons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PHWE-Record-Release-Form.pdf
- **File size**: 98,690 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: "Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information" — a standard ROI/authorization form. Has text layer but no fillable fields. Created in Word on Mac. Title references "PHWE" (Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, a Proliance member practice).
- **Notes**: This is the primary ROI form linked from the main Proliance Surgeons medical records page. Covers scope selection, sensitive information categories (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), recipient info, marketing disclosures, expiration, and patient rights including revocation.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://proliancesurgeons.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PACO-PROS-Medical-Records-Release-Authorization-INCOMING-Records.pdf
- **File size**: 63,665 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" for incoming records — used to request records FROM another provider TO Proliance Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons (Bellingham, WA location). Pre-filled with PROS destination address and fax.
- **Notes**: This is an incoming records request form, not a patient-initiated release. Useful for understanding how Proliance handles record transfers but oriented toward getting records sent TO them, not from them to patients.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.proortho.com/wp-content/uploads/authorization-to-disclose.pdf
- **File size**: 99,656 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: "Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information" — nearly identical to form-2. Hosted on proortho.com (ProOrtho, a Proliance member practice). Has fillable checkbox fields.
- **Notes**: Same template as form-2 but with interactive checkboxes. This version appears to be more digitally accessible.

## Difficulties

- **None significant**. Forms were easy to find via web search. The main Proliance medical records page (https://proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links to the form and also mentions Datavant as their ROI partner for online requests.
- form-1.pdf is an image-only scan with no text layer, limiting its accessibility.
- Proliance is a large multi-practice group, so different member practices (PHWE, PROS/PACO, ProOrtho, NPS/MRI) host their own versions of the form, leading to some fragmentation.

## Summary

Proliance Surgeons makes their ROI form readily available online. The primary form (form-2) is a 1-page authorization covering standard HIPAA disclosure elements. Multiple variants exist across their member practices. The organization also offers online records requests through Datavant. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

- **Location**: Charleston, SC
- **Type**: Teaching hospital, major system, government-owned

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search**: `"MUSC Health" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — returned several candidate URLs including the main authorization form on muschealth.org and variants hosted on insurance/dental subpaths.
2. **Web search**: `"MUSC Health" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — surfaced the primary form URL, a MyChart instructions PDF, a dental records form, and a third-party-hosted copy of a MUSC form.
3. **Web search**: `site:muschealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records page at `muschealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records` and found direct form links.
4. **Website navigation**: Browsed to the medical records page, explored all three tabs (MyChart Patient Portal, Online eRequest, Manual Request). The "Authorization Form for Medical Records Release" section at the bottom of the page links to both English and Spanish versions of the form.

**What worked best**: The second web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URLs. The website navigation confirmed these are the official forms and revealed the Spanish version.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf
- **File size**: 158,878 bytes
- **Description**: Main "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (English). This is the primary ROI form linked directly from the MUSC Health medical records page. It is a fillable PDF with fields for patient information, release from/to, record types, purpose of release, and authorization/signature section. Appears to be the current/updated version (version 1.7 PDF).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/insurance/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.ashx?la=en
- **File size**: 391,700 bytes
- **Description**: Another version of the "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form, hosted under the insurance section of the website. Version 11, dated 11/17. One page.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/dental/dental-files/records-release.ashx?la=en
- **File size**: 486,083 bytes
- **Description**: Authorization to Release Protected Health Information form specific to MUSC College of Dental Medicine. Version 9, dated 5/19. Includes dental-specific fax number (843-792-7009) and email (cdmimages@musc.edu). One page form.

- **File size**: 244,831 bytes

### form-5.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/spanish-auth-to-release-phi.pdf

- **Description**: Spanish language version of the main authorization form ("Autorización para Divulgar Información de Salud Protegida"). Bilingual header with both Spanish and English title. Same structure as form-1 but in Spanish.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **None significant**. The forms were easy to find — the medical records page is well-organized with clear links. All PDFs downloaded successfully via curl without bot blocking.
- The annual patient access form URL (`musc.edu/cce/ORDFRMS/pdf/all_all_consent_authtorelease_ptannualaccess.pdf`) returned an HTML page rather than a PDF, suggesting that URL is no longer valid.
- MUSC also offers an online eRequest portal via Ciox/Swellbox (`swellbox.com/medical-university-sc-wizard.html`) for patients to request records electronically without downloading a form.

## Summary

MUSC Health provides a well-organized medical records page with three request pathways: MyChart portal, online eRequest (via Ciox), and manual form submission. The main authorization form is available in both English and Spanish as downloadable PDFs. A separate dental-specific version exists. The forms are directly linked from the medical records page under "Authorization Form for Medical Records Release" — findability is excellent (2 clicks from homepage: Patients & Visitors → Medical Records).

# University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately returned the direct PDF link and the medical records request page.
2. **Site-scoped search** for "site:uihc.org medical records release form authorization" — confirmed the same resources.

The form was very easy to find. The first web search returned a direct link to the official PDF hosted on healthcare.uiowa.edu.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/marcom/uihc/legal/consent-to-release.pdf
- **File size**: 130,005 bytes
- **Description**: Official UIHC "Form 1989: ADMIN – CONSENT TO RELEASE OF INFORMATION AND RIGHT OF ACCESS REQUEST." This is the current, official ROI/authorization form hosted on the University of Iowa Health Care website. It includes patient identification fields, recipient info, format options (electronic CD/USB/email, fax, paper, verbal), record type checkboxes, date range, reason for release, and consent language. References sensitive categories (substance use, mental health, HIV, genetic information). Has a text layer (not image-only).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://irp.cdn-website.com/fa690e1e/files/uploaded/UI%20Medical%20Release%20Form%20fillin-2023.pdf
- **File size**: 93,843 bytes
- **Description**: A fillable version of the same Form 1989, hosted on a third-party CDN (irp.cdn-website.com). This version appears to be pre-populated with a specific recipient ("Safer Driver Solutions" in Richland, IA) and has "Rehab/disability" pre-checked as the reason for release. It is likely a version customized by a third party (driving rehabilitation service) for their clients to authorize UIHC records release. Still the same underlying UIHC form structure. Has fillable form fields and a text layer.

## Key Observations

- UIHC makes their ROI form readily available — a single web search finds the direct PDF link.
- The official medical records request page is at https://uihc.org/medical-records-request with clear instructions.
- The form supports multiple delivery formats: electronic (CD, USB drive, email), fax, paper, and verbal.
- Submission methods include email (him-consentform@uiowa.edu), fax, and mail.
- The form is called "Consent to Release of Information AND Right of Access Request" — it serves dual purpose for both third-party release and patient access.

## Difficulties

- None. The form was straightforward to find and download. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-rendered pages encountered.

# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Providence St. Vincent Medical Center
- **Location**: Portland, OR
- **Website**: https://www.providence.org/locations/or/st-vincent-medical-center
- **Parent System**: Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH) — major nonprofit health system operating across AK, CA, MT, NM, OR, TX, WA

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for organization-specific form**: Searched for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center Portland Oregon authorization release health information form PDF". This did not return a facility-specific form but pointed to the parent system (Providence) forms.

2. **Web search for parent system forms**: Searched for "Providence health system medical records release form authorization PDF". Found the OR/MT authorization form directly linked from Providence's website.

3. **Site-specific search**: Searched "site:providence.org authorization release medical records form". Found the main medical records authorization page and the OR/MT-specific authorization PDF.

4. **Navigating the Providence HIM page**: Fetched https://www.providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management which listed multiple forms including the "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" form — a newer, patient-access-specific form.

5. **Additional search for Oregon-specific forms**: Found an older OR/MT-specific "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" form.

## What Worked
- Providence publishes ROI forms at the system level, not per-facility. Searching for the parent system was essential.
- The Health Information Management page (https://www.providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management) was the most comprehensive source, listing multiple forms and detailed instructions.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.providence.org/-/media/Project/psjh/shared/Files/roi/or-mt-auth-release.pdf
- **File size**: 282,968 bytes (283 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **What it is**: "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" — the general ROI authorization form for Oregon/Montana. Covers both patient access and third-party release. Includes checkboxes for state selection (MT, OR, CA, WA, AK), delivery method options (Email, MyChart, Paper, Disc, Fax), record type selection, and special categories requiring initials (HIV/AIDS, Mental Health, Genetic Testing, Drug/Alcohol). Has fillable form fields. Revision date 03/20, form number ORC 240A.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.providence.org/-/media/project/psjh/shared/files/roi/english-psjh-patient-request-for-access.pdf
- **File size**: 96,585 bytes (97 KB)
- **Pages**: 2 (based on text content)
- **What it is**: "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" — a newer PSJH-wide patient access form. Specifically designed for patients requesting their own records (or disclosing to a named recipient). Includes options for record format (MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, Fax), record type checkboxes, date range, and sensitive information categories requiring initials. Updated contact info references R1RCM (outsourced ROI vendor). Form number 940507 (3/27/25).

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.providence.org/-/media/project/psjh/shared/files/roi/or-mt-access-designated-record-set.pdf
- **File size**: 754,824 bytes (755 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **What it is**: "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — an older OR/MT-specific patient access form. Similar to form-2 but with older contact information (PH&S instead of PSJH, different phone/fax/email). Includes state selection checkboxes (AK, CA, MT, WA, OR), delivery options, record type selection. Revision date 03/20. Larger file size suggests it may contain embedded images or different compression.

## Difficulties
- No facility-specific form exists for St. Vincent Medical Center; all forms are at the Providence system level.
- Providence has multiple overlapping forms: a general authorization (form-1) and patient-access-specific forms (form-2, form-3), with form-2 appearing to be the newer replacement for form-3.
- The HIM page notes that ROI is now handled centrally (not on-site at facilities) through a third-party vendor (R1RCM).

## Key Observations
- Providence offers **three distinct forms**: a general ROI authorization and two generations of patient-access-specific forms.
- All forms include **fillable PDF fields** and **text layers** — they are not image-only scans.
- All forms offer **multiple delivery formats** including MyChart, email, fax, paper, and disc.
- The forms cover **multiple states** via checkbox selection rather than having state-specific versions.
- Providence has centralized ROI processing to a single PO Box in Portland, OR 97208.

- **Website:** https://www.essentiahealth.org/find-facility/essentia-health-fosston
- **Location:** Fosston, MN
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, part of regional Essentia Health system (nonprofit, Midwest)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Essentia Health authorization release health information form PDF"** — immediately surfaced the direct PDF link and the medical records page. Very effective.
2. **Web search for "Essentia Health Fosston medical records release form PDF"** — pointed to the same Essentia Health medical records page. The Fosston facility does not have its own form; it uses the system-wide Essentia Health forms.
3. **Navigated the Essentia Health medical records page** (https://www.essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records) — found the main authorization form, a verbal authorization form, and references to MyChart-based access and an online request tool (Swellbox/Datavant).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.essentiahealth.org/-/media/Project/Essentia/Essentia/pages/documents/Medical-Records-Authorization.pdf
- **Document type:** Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (ROI form)

- **File size:** 169,186 bytes
- **Pages:** 1

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://essentiamychart.org/MyChart/myhealthselfauthorization.pdf
- **Document type:** MyChart Access Self-Authorization Form
- **Description:** Single-page form authorizing Essentia Health to release personal health information to the patient via an online MyChart account. Not a traditional ROI form — it's specifically for granting patient portal access. Has text layer.
- **File size:** 110,457 bytes
- **Pages:** 1

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.essentiamychart.org/MyChart/MyChart%20Adult%20Proxy.pdf
- **Document type:** Adult Patient Proxy Authorization Form (MyChart)
- **Description:** Single-page form for granting proxy access to another adult's MyChart account. Created via "Microsoft Print to PDF" — no extractable text layer (image-only/vector rendering), no embedded fonts. Title: "EH4583_Proof.pdf". Not a standard ROI form.
- **File size:** 373,164 bytes
- **Pages:** 1

### form-4.pdf

- **Document type:** Verbal Authorization Form
- **Description:** Form granting Essentia Health permission to verbally discuss medical and billing information with designated individuals.

- **File size:** 720,590 bytes
- **Pages:** 1 (appears to be a 2-page form based on content)

## Difficulties
- **None significant.** The forms were easy to find. Essentia Health has a well-organized medical records page with direct PDF links.
- form-3.pdf (MyChart Adult Proxy) has no extractable text — it was created via "Print to PDF" which rendered it as a non-text document despite being a vector PDF.
- Essentia Health-Fosston does not have facility-specific forms; all forms are system-wide via the parent Essentia Health organization.

## Additional Notes
- Essentia Health also offers an **online request tool** via Swellbox (https://www.swellbox.com/essentia-health-wizard.html) as an alternative to downloading and submitting the PDF form.
- Their ROI vendor is **Datavant** (contact: 866-203-7454).
- The medical records page mentions **MyChart** as the primary way to access records, with the PDF authorization form as a secondary option.

# Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP)
- **Parent System**: Penn Medicine (University of Pennsylvania Health System)
- **Website**: https://www.pennmedicine.org
- **Location**: Philadelphia, PA

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — Found multiple sources including the UPenn medical school site and a third-party neurology practice hosting the form.
2. **Web search** for `Penn Medicine "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` — Found the official Penn Medicine patient access page and additional PDF links.
3. **Navigated Penn Medicine website** at https://www.pennmedicine.org/patient-resources/policies/patient-access-health-information — Found the official authorization form link and detailed instructions for submitting to each Penn Medicine hospital.

The Penn Medicine patient access page was initially blocked by Incapsula bot protection when fetched via `web_fetch`, but loaded successfully in the browser (Chrome DevTools).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/assets/user-content/Authorization%20for%20Disclosure%20of%20Health%20Information_ADA.pdf
- **Also available at** (identical file): https://tupa-q-001.sitecorecontenthub.cloud/api/public/content/Authorization-for-Disclosure-of-Health-Information.pdf (linked from Penn Medicine's official patient access page)
- **File size**: 175,352 bytes
- **Document type**: Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information — the current/official Penn Medicine ROI form
- **Description**: ADA-accessible version of Penn Medicine's system-wide authorization form. Includes checkboxes for all Penn Medicine locations (HUP, Penn Presbyterian, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Health, Princeton Health, CPUP/CCA outpatient practices, Penn Medicine at Home). Has fillable fields for patient info, record types, date ranges, behavioral health and substance use disorder authorization sections, and signature fields. Lists specific record types available (discharge summary, operative report, labs, radiology, H&P, clinic/progress notes, billing, etc.). Authorization expires 180 days after signing.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://abingtonneurology.com/forms/PDFs/Penn_Medicine_Records_Request.pdf
- **File size**: 313,635 bytes (2 pages)
- **Document type**: Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information — an older/alternate version of the Penn Medicine ROI form
- **Description**: Similar content to form-1 but appears to be an older version hosted on a partner neurology practice's website. Lists fewer Penn Medicine locations and includes "Penn Home Care & Hospice" instead of "Penn Medicine at Home." Includes delivery method options (US Mail, CD, Email with security warnings). Includes purpose of request checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Care). Also expires 180 days after signing. Larger file size suggests it may contain embedded images/branding.

## Difficulties
- The Penn Medicine patient access page (pennmedicine.org) uses Incapsula bot protection, which blocked programmatic HTTP fetches. Browser navigation worked fine.
- Both forms are for general disclosure of health information (to third parties or self), not specifically a patient-access-only form. The website directs patients who want their own records to use the patient portal (myPennMedicine) instead.

## Summary
Penn Medicine has a clear patient access page with a single authorization form for disclosure of health information. The form is well-organized and covers all Penn Medicine facilities. Two versions were found — the current ADA-accessible version (form-1) and an older version hosted on a partner practice site (form-2). The organization directs patients who want their own records to the patient portal for self-service access, while the authorization form is primarily for third-party disclosure.

# Good Samaritan Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Good Samaritan Medical Center
- **Location:** West Palm Beach, FL
- **Website:** https://www.goodsamaritanmc.com
- **Parent System:** Palm Beach Health Network (PBHN), part of Tenet Healthcare
- **Type:** Community hospital, for-profit, major system affiliation

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Good Samaritan Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found a direct link to the PDF on the hospital's website.
2. **Web search** for `"Good Samaritan Medical Center" "medical records" "release form"` — confirmed the same form and also found the parent Palm Beach Health Network's medical records request page.
3. **Parent system check** — navigated to https://www.palmbeachhealthnetwork.com/patients/request-medical-records, which lists the same form in English, Spanish, and Creole, along with contact info for all PBHN facilities.

## Difficulties
- **Bot blocking via Cloudflare:** Direct `curl` downloads returned HTML instead of the PDF, even with realistic User-Agent headers and Referer. Required using the browser (Chrome DevTools) to fetch the PDF via JavaScript `fetch()`, extract as base64, and decode locally.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.goodsamaritanmc.com/docs/librariesprovidergoodsam/default-document-library/authorization-to-use-disclose-phi.pdf?sfvrsn=be460533_0
- **File size:** 35,211 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Document type:** Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information
- **Description:** Good Samaritan Medical Center-specific ROI form. Older version (catalog date 06/12/2014, EID-2028). Includes patient info fields, checkboxes for record types to disclose (face sheet, discharge summary, H&P, labs, etc.), recipient info, authorization term, purpose, and a second page with super-confidential information categories (mental illness, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, etc.) requiring separate authorization. Has text layer (not a scan). No fillable form fields — designed as a print-and-fill form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.palmbeachhealthnetwork.com/docs/pbhnbuildlibraries/default-document-library/authorization-to-use-disclose-phi-(eng).pdf?sfvrsn=4ea88cdc_1
- **File size:** 125,979 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Document type:** Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information (PBHN network-wide version)
- **Description:** Palm Beach Health Network's version of the same form, covering all six PBHN facilities including Good Samaritan Medical Center. Newer version (catalog date 11/17/2020, EID-2028). Includes facility selection checkboxes, email field, and "Original Materials Released" section for blocks/slides. Otherwise very similar structure to form-1. Larger file size likely due to embedded images/logos. Also a print-and-fill form with no interactive fields.

## Key Observations
- The hospital has its own facility-specific form (form-1) and also participates in the parent network's shared form (form-2).
- The parent network page also offers Spanish and Haitian Creole versions of the form.
- Records requests are processed via Datavant (third-party ROI vendor), with email submission to SM-Tenetgoodsamaritan@Datavant.com.
- Both forms are 2-page authorization forms covering standard ROI plus super-confidential health information categories.
- Neither form has fillable/interactive PDF fields.

# Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital
- **Website**: https://samhealth.org/find-a-location/samaritan-lebanon-community-hospital/
- **Location**: Lebanon, OR
- **Parent System**: Samaritan Health Services (samhealth.org)
- **Type**: Community hospital, regional system, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

### What was tried:
1. **Web search** for "Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" — pointed to the parent system's medical records request page and forms/documents page.
2. **Web search** for "Samaritan Health Services medical records release form authorization PDF Oregon" — identified key pages including the computer-readable files page and forms/documents page.
3. **Web search** for "site:samhealth.org authorization release medical records" — found the MRO online portal, computer-readable files page, and forms/documents page.
4. **Navigating samhealth.org** — browsed the Request Medical Records page, Computer Readable Files page, and Forms and Documents page.
5. **Browser inspection** — used JavaScript to extract all links from the medical records page, which revealed hidden/collapsed download links for the standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information form (English and Spanish) that weren't visible in the initial markdown rendering.
6. **MRO portal inspection** — confirmed the MRO Express portal is a web-only form (no downloadable PDF).

### What worked:
- The standard ROI form (Authorization to Disclose Health Information) was found by extracting all links from the Request Medical Records page using browser DevTools. The links were inside a collapsed/accordion section ("Sending a Request by Mail or Fax") that wasn't visible in the initial page fetch.
- The Computer Readable EHI Export Request forms were found on the dedicated "Request Computer Readable Files" subpage, also in a collapsed section.
- The Notice of Privacy Practices was found on the Forms and Documents page.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://samhealth.org/computer-readable-ehi-export-request-english?type=pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Disclose Electronic Health Information in Computer Readable Export (English)
- **Pages**: 2

- **Document type**: Authorization to Disclose Health Information (English) — **Primary ROI form**
- **Pages**: 2
- **File size**: 647,777 bytes
- **Description**: The standard ROI/authorization form for requesting medical records from any Samaritan Health Services facility. Includes checkboxes for specific facilities (including "Samaritan Lebanon Hospital"), record types, date ranges, format options (MyChart, Email, Paper, CD, Fax), sensitive information initials, and release-to-self or third-party options. This is the main form patients would use to request their medical records.

### form-5.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://samhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Authorization-to-Disclose-Health-Information-Spanish.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Disclose Health Information (Spanish) — **Primary ROI form (Spanish)**
- **Pages**: 2
- **File size**: 517,175 bytes
- **Description**: Spanish-language version of form-4.pdf.

## Difficulties Encountered
- **No prominent download link**: The standard ROI form is not prominently linked on the medical records request page. The page primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal. The downloadable PDF form links are hidden inside a collapsed/accordion section titled "Sending a Request by Mail or Fax" — requiring browser-based inspection to discover.
- **MRO portal is primary**: Samaritan Health Services has outsourced medical records request processing to MRO Corp. The primary method is an online portal, not a downloadable form.
- **Confusable search results**: Web searches returned forms from "Samaritan Medical Center" (Watertown, NY) and "samaritanhealth.com" which are different organizations from "Samaritan Health Services" (samhealth.org, Oregon).

## Summary
Samaritan Health Services provides forms at the system level (not facility-specific). The primary ROI form is form-4.pdf (Authorization to Disclose Health Information), which lists Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital as one of the facilities. They also offer a specialized Computer Readable EHI Export form and all forms are available in both English and Spanish. The organization primarily directs patients to an online MRO portal for records requests.

# OrthoCarolina — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched `OrthoCarolina "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return direct OrthoCarolina results.
2. **Web search for medical records release**: Searched `OrthoCarolina "medical records" "release form" Charlotte NC` — found the main form URL and the medical records resource page.
3. **Site-scoped search**: Searched `site:orthocarolina.com authorization release medical records` — confirmed form URLs and found an additional variant.

Strategy #2 was most effective, immediately returning the direct PDF link and the medical records resource page URL.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.orthocarolina.com/storage/wysiwyg/authorization_for_access_use_disclosure_of_protected_health_information.pdf
- **File size**: 218,210 bytes
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization form — "Authorization for Access/Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information"
- **Notes**: Current version of OrthoCarolina's ROI form. Includes fields for patient info, date ranges, record types (office notes, operative report, discharge summary, PT, labs, MRI, CT, itemized statement), radiology images, recipient info, purpose of release (medical/patient care, legal review, insurance, personal use, other), and delivery method options (paper copies, email, fax, CD, pick up). Has sections for sensitive information consent (HIV, substance abuse, mental health, genetic). Includes signature and revocation language. Header references HIM/Release of Information Department at 4601 Park Road, Suite 250, Charlotte, NC 28209.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.orthocarolina.com/storage/components/authorization_for_use_disclosure_of_phi_6-20171_1.pdf
- **File size**: 130,629 bytes
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization form — "Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (older version)
- **Notes**: An older version of the form (filename suggests June 2017). Slightly different layout — titled "Authorization for Use/Disclosure" (without "Access"). Includes copy fee disclosure upfront. Different fax number (704-323-3941 vs 704-323-3806 in newer versions). Similar content but slightly different checkbox options (includes "Photographs" and "Consultation Reports" as separate options). Does not mention patient portal upload as a submission method.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.orthocarolina.com/storage/wysiwyg/authorization_for_access_use_disclosure_of_phi_3.pdf
- **File size**: 406,966 bytes
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization form — "Authorization for Access/Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (variant)
- **Notes**: Another version/variant of the authorization form. Very similar to form-1 but with minor differences. Mentions patient portal upload as a submission option. Notes that radiology images "can only be provided on a CD". Larger file size suggests it may contain embedded images or different formatting. Same mailing address and contact info as form-1.

## Difficulties

- No significant difficulties. All forms were directly downloadable via curl with no bot blocking or JavaScript rendering required.
- OrthoCarolina maintains multiple versions of essentially the same form at different URLs, which may cause confusion for patients.

## Summary

OrthoCarolina makes their ROI forms readily available online. The medical records page (https://www.orthocarolina.com/resources-category/medical-records) is the main resource hub. Three versions of the authorization form were found — all are legitimate ROI forms with slightly different layouts and features. Form-1 appears to be the current primary version linked from the medical records page.

# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Carle BroMenn Medical Center authorization release health information filetype:pdf"** — Found a behavioral health authorization form hosted on carle.org.
2. **Web search for "Carle BroMenn Medical Center medical records release form filetype:pdf"** — Found several PDF forms including a CBMC-specific general ROI form, a system-level Carle Health ROI form, and behavioral health variants.
3. **Web search for "site:carle.org authorization release medical records"** — Confirmed the Carle medical records page at carle.org/patients-visitors/patient-resources/medical-records, plus the Carle Health patient release form and behavioral health form.

The most productive strategy was the second search, which surfaced multiple form URLs directly. Carle BroMenn Medical Center is part of Carle Health, and both facility-specific and system-level forms are available on carle.org.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf

- **Notes**: This is the system-level Carle Health ROI form, listing the HIM department at 3310 Fields South Drive, Champaign, IL 61822 (the main Carle campus). Similar structure to form-1 but for the Champaign location. Includes method of release options (mail, pick up at HIM). Has text layer.

### form-3.pdf

# TriStar Centennial Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `TriStar Centennial Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found the medical records request page.
2. **Web search** for `TriStar Centennial Medical Center "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same page and also surfaced a Centennial Medical Group form.
3. **Navigated the medical records page** at `https://www.tristarhealth.com/locations/tristar-centennial-medical-center/for-patients/medical-records` — found direct PDF download links for English and Spanish authorization forms hosted on HCA's DAM (Digital Asset Management) system at `hcadam.com`.

## What Worked

The web search was immediately effective. The medical records page is well-organized and prominently links to the authorization form PDFs. TriStar Centennial is part of the HCA Healthcare system, and the forms are standardized HCA forms (form number HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21). The page also offers an online portal option via Swellbox.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.hcadam.com/api/public/content/46695a9ba25e4b9aa6376f53cef033ac?v=b53c28b5`
- **Linked from**: TriStar Centennial medical records page (English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information")
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization for Release of PHI (Protected Health Information)
- **Size**: 173,750 bytes (~170 KB), 1 page
- **Description**: Standard HCA authorization form. Includes patient info, recipient info, purpose of disclosure, delivery format options (paper, electronic media, encrypted/unencrypted email), record type checkboxes (consultation, discharge summary, ER report, etc.), USCDI release option, sensitive information handling, signature section. Form number HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21. Has text layer; appears to have fillable fields.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://centennialmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Med-Record-request-FROM-CMG.pdf`
- **Linked from**: Web search results (Centennial Medical Group — affiliated physician group)
- **Document type**: Medical records request/release authorization form for Centennial Medical Group
- **Size**: 172,981 bytes (~169 KB), 2 pages
- **Description**: Instructions page plus authorization form for records from Centennial Medical Group (affiliated physician practice). Uses Record Reproduction Services (RRS) as third-party vendor. Includes legal requirements section with agree/disagree checkboxes for sensitive records (HIV/AIDS, psychiatric, substance abuse, mental health). 6-month default expiration. This is for the affiliated physician group, not the hospital itself.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.hcadam.com/api/public/content/e109b112b80f42fc8291acbe0b1435fa?v=829b113e`

- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization form (Spanish language version of form-1)
- **Size**: 168,110 bytes (~164 KB), 1 page
- **Description**: Spanish-language version of the same HCA authorization form. Same structure and fields as form-1.

## Difficulties

- **None significant.** The forms were easy to find and download. The HCA DAM URLs worked with a standard curl request. No bot blocking or JavaScript rendering required.
- Minor pdftotext warnings about name token length, but text extraction worked fine.

## Additional Notes

- TriStar Centennial is part of HCA Healthcare (for-profit), and uses the standardized HCA authorization form system-wide.
- The medical records page also offers an **online portal** (Swellbox) for submitting requests digitally, plus the MyHealthONE patient portal for direct record access.
- The HCA form notably includes a **USCDI Release Request** option ("to include all elements as defined in the United States Core Data for Interoperability"), which is unusual and forward-looking.
- Delivery options include encrypted email, unencrypted email (with risk disclaimer), electronic media, and paper copy.
- The form expires after 180 days by default.

# ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP
- **Website:** https://www.entandallergy.com
- **Location:** Tarrytown, NY (80+ offices across NY, NJ, PA, TX)
- **Type:** Physician practice, independent, for-profit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release form with filetype:pdf** — Found a reference to a `.doc` file hosted at `entandallergy.com/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`. No PDF version of the ROI form was found directly on the site.
2. **Web search for medical records release form on site** — Confirmed the `.doc` form URL and found no additional PDF forms specifically for medical records release.
3. **Website navigation** — Browsed homepage and FAQ page. The site has no visible "Patient Forms" or "Medical Records" section in the main navigation. The FAQ section has a "Medical records – Questions regarding how they are processed?" entry, but it only discusses record retention policies, not how to request records or download a release form.
4. **Footer links** — Found an "Allergy Authorization Form" PDF in the footer, which turned out to be a form completion fee acknowledgment (not an ROI form).

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.entandallergy.com/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc (Word document, converted to PDF via LibreOffice)
- **Original format:** Microsoft Word .doc file (created 2009, last edited by Eric Bergman)
- **Document type:** AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA
- **Pages:** 2
- **File size:** 130,075 bytes
- **Text extractable:** Yes (4,440 characters)
- **Description:** This is the organization's official ROI form. It references New York and New Jersey state law and HIPAA. Includes sections for specifying information to release (medical records by date range, entire medical record, or other), special authorization for alcohol/drug treatment, mental health, and HIV-related information. Has fields for patient name, DOB, SSN, address, and provider/recipient information. Includes authorization to discuss health information with attorney or government agency. The form has an expiration section and signature line. Notably, this is a Word document (not a fillable PDF), which is unusual.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.entandallergy.com/documents/Patient-Acknowledgment-Form_6.5.25_F.pdf
- **Document type:** Patient Acknowledgment Form – Allergy Form Completion Fee
- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 144,217 bytes
- **Text extractable:** Yes (1,354 characters)
- **Description:** This is NOT an ROI form. It is an acknowledgment form informing patients that a $25 fee applies for physician completion of allergy-related forms (e.g., school/activity forms). Found in the website footer labeled "Allergy Authorization Form."

## Difficulties Encountered
- **No dedicated patient forms page:** The website lacks a "Patient Forms" or "Medical Records Request" section, making the ROI form very difficult to find through site navigation alone.
- **Form is a .doc file, not PDF:** The ROI form is hosted as a Microsoft Word document rather than a PDF, which is unusual and less accessible. It had to be converted to PDF for this study.
- **Form is not linked from any visible page:** The `.doc` form URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) does not appear to be linked from any navigable page on the current website. It was only discoverable via web search.
- **Old form:** The Word document metadata shows it was last saved in January 2009, suggesting it may be outdated.

# Springhill Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Springhill Medical Center
- **Location:** Mobile, AL
- **Website:** https://springhillmedicalcenter.com
- **Type:** Community hospital, independent, for-profit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms** — Searched for `"Springhill Medical Center" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`. This returned a direct link to the ROI form hosted on their website.
2. **Site-specific search** — Searched `site:springhillmedicalcenter.com authorization release medical records`. Found both the form PDF and their Medical Records webpage.
3. **Medical Records page** — Navigated to https://springhillmedicalcenter.com/patients-visitors/medical-records. This page links to:
   - A Zoho-based online request portal for electronic ROI requests
   - A downloadable infographic about patient health information rights
   - The patient portal

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://springhillmedicalcenter.com/sites/default/files/2020-10/Release-of-information-2011-Version-1.pdf
- **Document type:** ROI / Authorization for Release of Health Information form
- **File size:** 74,165 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Description:** Single-page "REQUEST FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION" form. Includes patient demographics, inpatient/outpatient selection, checkboxes for record types (Abstract, Entire Record, H&P, Discharge Summary, ER Record, Lab Reports, X-ray, etc.), purpose of disclosure, and delivery method options (pick-up, mail, fax, patient portal, email). Has text layer. Authorization language references consent revocability, 6-month expiration, and notes that redisclosure may occur. The form header shows "3719 Dauphin Street, P.O. Box 8709, Mobile, AL 36608" and references "Springhill Memorial Hospital."

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://springhillmedicalcenter.com/sites/default/files/YourHealthInformationYourRights_Infographic-Web.pdf
- **Document type:** Patient health information rights infographic (NOT an ROI form)
- **File size:** 5,038,839 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Description:** ONC-branded "GET IT. CHECK IT. USE IT." infographic about patient rights to access health records under HIPAA. Cites statistics about patient awareness and access. Not organization-specific — this is a general educational resource from HealthIT.gov.

## Additional Observations

- The medical records page also features a **Zoho-based online ROI request portal** at `https://creatorapp.zohopublic.com/medrecsmanagement/medrecs-roi/...` for submitting electronic requests. This is a third-party ROI management service (MedRecs Management).
- The ROI form (form-1.pdf) dates from 2011 based on the filename and appears to be a flat PDF (no fillable fields based on the text extraction showing underscores for fill-in areas).
- The form offers multiple delivery methods including patient portal and email, which is notable for a 2011-era form.
- HIM fax number listed on the website: 251.410.4014.
- The form still references the older name "Springhill Memorial Hospital."

## Difficulties
- None — the form was easily findable via web search and directly linked from the organization's website.
- Retrieval difficulty: **easy**

# Holy Cross Hospital (Taos, NM) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: Holy Cross Hospital (Holy Cross Medical Center)
- **Website**: https://holycrossmedicalcenter.org
- **Location**: Taos, NM 87571 (1397 Weimer Rd)
- **Type**: Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit
- **Also known as**: Taos Health Systems, Inc. (legal name); staff emails use @taoshospital.org

## Result: No ROI form found online

Holy Cross Medical Center does not publish a Release of Information / Authorization for Medical Records form on their website.

## Search Strategies Tried

### 1. Web searches (multiple queries)
- `"Holy Cross Hospital" Taos NM "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no results
- `"Holy Cross Medical Center" Taos NM medical records request release authorization form download` — no direct form found
- `site:holycrossmedicalcenter.org authorization release medical records` — no form found on the site; results confused with Holy Cross Health (Maryland), a completely different organization
- `"taoshospital.org" OR "holycrossmedicalcenter.org" "release of information" form` — no results
- `holycrossmedicalcenter.org wp-content uploads authorization release form PDF` — no form found
- `"Holy Cross Hospital" Taos "release" form pdf` — no results specific to Taos location

### 2. Website navigation (via browser)
- **Forms page** (https://holycrossmedicalcenter.org/forms/): Page exists but is completely empty — only has the heading "FORMS" with no content or links
- **Patients & Visitors** (https://holycrossmedicalcenter.org/patient-visitor-information/): No link to medical records or ROI section. Subpages cover policies, billing, advocacy but nothing about records release
- **Privacy Practices** page: Contains full Notice of Privacy Practices text (mentions right to access records) but no link to an ROI form
- **Patient Portal** page: Describes MyCareCorner portal for accessing visit info; no ROI form link
- **Site search** for "medical records release": Returns "Nothing Found"

### 3. Wayback Machine
- Checked archived version of /forms/ page (October 2024 capture) — page was also empty at that time, confirming the forms page has never had content

### 4. Third-party sources
- medicalrecords.com listing confirms the hospital exists (25-bed acute care, NPI 1902338049) but offers its own paid service rather than linking to the hospital's form
- No form found through any third-party medical records request service

## Difficulties Encountered
- **Empty forms page**: The website has a dedicated /forms/ page that contains no actual forms — this appears to be a placeholder that was never populated (created June 2022, never updated)
- **Name confusion**: Multiple unrelated "Holy Cross" healthcare organizations exist (Holy Cross Health in Maryland/Florida, Providence Holy Cross in California), which polluted search results
- **No medical records section**: Unlike most hospital websites, Holy Cross Medical Center Taos has no dedicated "Medical Records" or "Health Information Management" page in its navigation
- **Form only available by phone/in-person**: Based on search results, patients must contact the hospital directly at (575) 758-8883 to obtain the authorization form

## Downloaded PDFs
None — no ROI form or related documents were found to download.

## Contact Information for Records
- Privacy Officer: Amalia Salazar, (575) 751-5739, asalazar@taoshospital.org
- Quality/Risk/Compliance: Misty Carruth, RN, BSN, CPHQ, (575) 751-5712, mistyc@taoshospital.org

# Michigan Medicine (University of Michigan Health) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Michigan Medicine University of Michigan Health authorization release of health information form PDF" — immediately found direct links to the current ROI form on uofmhealth.org and an older version on medicine.umich.edu.
2. **Web search** for "site:uofmhealth.org medical records release authorization form" — confirmed the same forms and also surfaced the "Request for Outside Records" form and the Medical Records landing page.
3. No need to navigate the website manually; the forms were directly discoverable via web search.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.uofmhealth.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/ROI_.pdf
- **File size:** 770,186 bytes
- **Description:** Current "Authorization to Release Copies of a Medical Record" form. Title says "(Patient Requests Information To Be Sent From UMH)." This is the primary, current ROI form for Michigan Medicine. Has text layer, fillable fields, mentions MyUofMHealth.org Patient Portal and electronic email web link delivery. Includes fee schedule on page 2. References both patient self-request and third-party release pathways.
- **Download method:** curl (direct download, no bot blocking)

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://medicine.umich.edu/sites/default/files/content/downloads/AuthorizationToReleaseCopiesOfMedicalRecord_2011-Sept-08_FINAL_FILLABLE.pdf
- **File size:** 260,121 bytes
- **Description:** Older version (dated 2011) of the same "Authorization to Release Copies of a Medical Record" form. Still references "University of Michigan Health System (UMHS)" branding rather than "Michigan Medicine." Has text layer and fillable fields. Includes eDelivery option and fee schedule.
- **Download method:** Browser (Chrome DevTools) — curl was blocked by Cloudflare challenge on medicine.umich.edu domain. Navigated to the URL in the browser, which passed the Cloudflare check, then extracted the PDF via JavaScript fetch.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.uofmhealth.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/release-from-other-organizations.pdf
- **File size:** 174,069 bytes
- **Description:** "Request for Outside Records — Patient Information From Another Organization (Authorization to Request)." This is the reverse direction — authorizing Michigan Medicine to *request* records from another provider on the patient's behalf. Not a standard ROI form for releasing Michigan Medicine records, but related to medical records authorization.
- **Download method:** curl (direct download, no bot blocking)

## Difficulties Encountered

- The older form on `medicine.umich.edu` was blocked by Cloudflare's bot protection when using curl. Had to use the browser (Chrome DevTools MCP) to navigate to the URL and download the PDF via in-page JavaScript fetch.
- The current form URL (`ROI_.pdf`) has a somewhat uninformative filename with a trailing underscore.

## Summary

Michigan Medicine makes their ROI forms readily available online. The current form (form-1.pdf, dated 2025-03) is prominently linked from their Medical Records page and was easy to find via web search. An older version (form-2.pdf, dated 2011) remains available on the medicine.umich.edu domain. Both forms support patient self-request and offer electronic delivery options. A separate form exists for requesting outside records (form-3.pdf).

# UMMC ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization

- **Website**: https://www.umc.edu
- **Location**: Jackson, MS

## Search Strategies

### What was tried
1. **Web search** for "University of Mississippi Medical Center authorization release health information form PDF" — identified two key URLs:
   - `https://www.umc.edu/Compliance/files/thefinalauthorizationform.pdf` (older URL)
   - `https://www.umc.edu/common/files/ummch/Health/Forms/release-of-medical-information.pdf` (current URL on site)

3. **Wayback Machine** — found archived HIPAA Forms page (Oct 2025) and Release Form page (Feb 2026), but the English PDF itself was never archived; only the Spanish version was archived
4. **Browser-based access** — navigated via Wayback Machine archived pages; confirmed the English PDF returns 404 on the live site while the Spanish version remains available
5. **pdf4pro.com cached copy** — found a cached/indexed copy of the English form via web search, successfully downloaded from their CDN

### What worked
- **Wayback Machine** for the Spanish version (`release-of-medical-information-ES.pdf`) — archived Feb 10, 2026
- **pdf4pro.com CDN** for the English version — cached copy of the older form

- **Description**: English-language version of the UMMC "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (Form #1862, Rev. 04/2018). Includes locations: Jackson, Grenada, Lexington, and Clinic/Other (no Madison). This is an older cached copy; the current English form link on the UMMC website is broken (404).

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **DNS resolution failure**: `www.umc.edu` could not be resolved via curl or direct browser navigation in this environment. The browser could only access the site indirectly through the Wayback Machine proxy context.

2. **Broken English form link**: The UMMC website's Release Form page (`/Healthcare/Patients-and-Visitors/Release-Form.html`) links to the English PDF at `/common/files/ummch/Health/Forms/release-of-medical-information.pdf`, which currently returns HTTP 404. The older URL (`/Compliance/files/thefinalauthorizationform.pdf`) also returns 404. The Spanish version at the same path with `-ES` suffix works fine.

3. **Wayback Machine gaps**: The English authorization form PDF was never archived by the Wayback Machine, despite the HTML pages linking to it being archived. Only the Spanish version PDF was captured.

4. **Cached copy age**: The English form obtained from pdf4pro.com is Form #1862 Rev. 04/2018 and lacks the Madison location that appears in the Spanish version, suggesting it's an older version.

## Key Observations

- UMMC publishes their ROI form in both English and Spanish
- The form is accessible from two paths: Compliance > HIPAA Forms, and Health Care > Patients and Visitors > Release Form
- The current English form link is broken (404) — a significant findability issue
- The form includes options for Paper, Electronic, and "View Access" delivery formats
- The authorization expires 6 months from signature date
- Sensitive information (substance abuse, mental health, HIV, genetic testing) requires separate initials
- The form requires a witness signature
- Multiple UMMC facility locations are listed on the form

# Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center
- **Website**: https://virginiagarcia.org
- **Location**: Hillsboro, OR
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search**: Searched for `Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center authorization release health information form PDF` — immediately returned direct links to the English ROI form PDF and the patient forms page.
2. **Patient Forms page**: Navigated to https://virginiagarcia.org/get-care/patient-forms/ to find all available ROI-related forms. The page uses Divi theme (WordPress) with clickable blurb modules — PDF URLs are not visible as standard `<a href>` links but are embedded in a JavaScript `et_link_options_data` array.
3. Found 4 Release of Information forms listed under a dedicated "Release of Information Forms" section.

## Difficulties

- The Spanish ROI form URL from the initial web search (`HIPAA-Release-of-Information-ROI-Form-Spanish-2.pdf`) returned an HTML page instead of a PDF — likely a redirect/404 page. The actual working URL was `HIPAA-Release-of-Information-ROI-Form-Spanish-1.pdf` (found via the Divi JavaScript config on the patient forms page).
- PDF links on the patient forms page are not standard HTML links; they are rendered via Divi theme JavaScript click handlers, requiring inspection of inline script data to extract URLs.

## Downloaded Forms

- **File size**: 66,700 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: Release of Verbal Health Information — Spanish version (Divulgación de Información Verbal de su Salud). Same form as form-3.pdf but in Spanish.

## Summary

Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center makes their ROI forms easily accessible via a dedicated Patient Forms page. They provide 4 forms: the main HIPAA ROI form in English and Spanish, plus a Verbal Health Information release form in English and Spanish. The forms are well-organized on the website under a clear "Release of Information Forms" heading. Retrieval difficulty: **easy** (forms found on first search and clearly labeled on the website).

# Troy Regional Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Troy Regional Medical Center
- **Website:** https://troymedicalcenter.com
- **Location:** Troy, AL
- **Type:** Community hospital, independent, government-owned

## Search Strategies

### Web searches
1. `"Troy Regional Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No direct PDF results
2. `"Troy Regional Medical Center" Troy AL "medical records" "release form"` — Found reference to old FastHealth site (trmc.fasthealth.com) with ROI page
3. `site:troymedicalcenter.com medical records release authorization` — No form found on current site
4. `Troy Regional Medical Center Troy Alabama release of information form PDF download` — Confirmed form exists on old FastHealth site, not on current site

### Website navigation
- Current site (troymedicalcenter.com) has a "Patients & Visitors" section but it lacks a medical records or HIM page
- The Patient Info page returned a 502 Bad Gateway error
- The sitemap confirmed no medical records or ROI-related pages exist on the current WordPress site
- Privacy Policy page exists but contains only the HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (no downloadable form)
- Patient Portal links to external site (thrivepatientportal.com)

### Old website
- Found the ROI form on the legacy FastHealth site: http://trmc.fasthealth.com/getpage.php?name=releaseofinfo
- This page links to a downloadable PDF: http://trmc.fasthealth.com/docs/Release_of_Information_-_Feb._2015.pdf

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** http://trmc.fasthealth.com/docs/Release_of_Information_-_Feb._2015.pdf
- **Document type:** Release of Information form (image-only scan)
- **File size:** 367,105 bytes (358 KB)
- **Pages:** 1
- **Text layer:** No — image-only scan (grayscale JPEG image at 200 DPI)
- **Fillable fields:** None
- **Notes:** This is a scanned paper form dated February 2015. The PDF contains a single full-page grayscale image with no extractable text. It was found only on the old FastHealth-hosted website, not on the current troymedicalcenter.com site. The filename on the server suggests it's from February 2015.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) does not appear to have any medical records release form or HIM page
- The Patient Information page on the current site returned a 502 Bad Gateway error
- The form was only available on the legacy FastHealth-hosted site (trmc.fasthealth.com), suggesting the hospital migrated to a new website but didn't carry over all patient-facing resources
- The form itself is an image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields

## Summary
Only one ROI form was found, hosted on the hospital's old website (trmc.fasthealth.com). The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) has no medical records page or downloadable authorization form. The form is a low-quality image-only scan from 2015 with no text layer or fillable fields.

# AdventHealth Hendersonville — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: AdventHealth Hendersonville (formerly Park Ridge Hospital)
- **Website**: https://www.adventhealth.com/hospital/adventhealth-hendersonville
- **Location**: 100 Hospital Drive, Hendersonville, NC 28792
- **System**: AdventHealth (major nonprofit system)

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web search for authorization/release forms (partially successful)
- Searched: `AdventHealth Hendersonville "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`
- Searched: `AdventHealth "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF download`
- Searched: `AdventHealth Hendersonville NC medical records request form download`
- Searched: `"Park Ridge Hospital" Hendersonville NC authorization release form PDF`
- Found several PDF forms hosted on adventhealth.com, but **none specific to AdventHealth Hendersonville**. The PDFs found were from sister facilities (St. Luke's Hospital in Columbus, NC and Florida Hospital Heartland Division in Sebring, FL).

### 2. Website navigation (successful — found primary method)
- Navigated to AdventHealth Hendersonville homepage → footer link "Medical Records"
- Medical Records page URL: https://www.adventhealth.com/hospital/adventhealth-hendersonville/medical-records
- Page has a "Who to Contact" section with tabs by region
- Under "Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina Locations" tab, AdventHealth Hendersonville is listed with:
  - Phone: 828-681-2135
  - Fax: 828-651-4018
  - **Online eRequest Form**: https://www.swellbox.com/adventhealth-mid-wizard.html
- **No downloadable PDF form is provided.** The facility uses an online Swellbox/Datavant wizard for all records requests.

### 3. Direct URL guessing for Hendersonville-specific PDFs (unsuccessful)
- Tried URL patterns like `hvl_form_medicalrecords_*`, `prh_form_medicalrecords_*` — all returned 404.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.adventhealth.com/sites/default/files/assets/slh_form_medicalrecords_patientrequestforaccess.pdf
- **Document type**: Patient Request for Access form
- **Facility**: St. Luke's Hospital, 101 Hospital Drive, Columbus, NC 28722 (sister AdventHealth facility in Polk County, NC — NOT AdventHealth Hendersonville)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Size**: 53,126 bytes
- **Notes**: Patient-access-specific form. Offers multiple format options (CD, flash drive, email, paper). Dated 6/2016. Still references "St. Luke's Hospital" branding (pre-AdventHealth rebrand).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.adventhealth.com/sites/default/files/assets/slh_form_medicalrecords_releaseofinformation.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Information (general third-party release)
- **Facility**: St. Luke's Hospital (same Columbus, NC sister facility)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Size**: 36,287 bytes
- **Notes**: General ROI form covering release to third parties. Includes comprehensive patient rights section, behavioral health/substance abuse consent, and 1-year expiration. References www.saintlukeshospital.com for Notice of Privacy Practices.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.adventhealth.com/sites/default/files/assets/WAU_FH-Records-Request-Form.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure and Request for Access to Protected Health Information
- **Facility**: Florida Hospital Heartland Division, 4200 Sun n' Lake Blvd., Sebring, FL 33871 (completely different facility)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Size**: 82,773 bytes
- **Notes**: Florida-specific form with 90-day expiration. Not relevant to AdventHealth Hendersonville. Downloaded because it appeared in web search results as a general AdventHealth form.

## Key Findings

1. **AdventHealth Hendersonville does not publish a downloadable PDF ROI/authorization form on their website.** Their primary mechanism for medical records requests is the Swellbox/Datavant online eRequest wizard.

2. The medical records page mentions that "paper copies of medical records may be released upon receipt of written authorization" but does not provide a downloadable authorization form — the accordion sections and "authorization form" links all point to the same location table with Swellbox links.

3. The closest PDF forms available are from St. Luke's Hospital (now AdventHealth) in Columbus, NC — a sister facility in the same Western NC region, ~40 miles away. These forms (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf) still carry "St. Luke's Hospital" branding from before the AdventHealth rebranding.

4. AdventHealth Hendersonville was formerly known as Park Ridge Hospital. No PDF forms under the Park Ridge name were found online.

## Difficulties
- No Hendersonville-specific PDF form exists online — the facility relies entirely on the Swellbox online wizard
- Web search results returned forms from other AdventHealth facilities, requiring careful verification of which facility each form belongs to
- The medical records page is shared across the entire AdventHealth system, making it harder to find location-specific information

# Blessing Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Blessing Hospital (part of Blessing Health System)
- **Location:** Quincy, IL
- **Website:** https://www.blessinghealth.org

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Blessing Hospital Quincy IL "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links to multiple versions of the ROI form.
2. **Web search** for `Blessing Hospital Quincy IL "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same URLs and found the medical records page.
3. **Web search** for `site:blessinghealth.org authorization release medical records` — found the medical records page and additional form URLs including Spanish version.
4. **Navigated website** at https://www.blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords — found the current (September 2025) versions of the English and Spanish forms linked directly from the Medical Records page. The page is well-organized under For Patients > Request Medical Records.

## Difficulties
- The Spanish form URL found via web search (older version) returned an HTML page instead of a PDF. The current 9-2025 Spanish version downloaded successfully.
- Multiple versions of the same form exist at different URLs (April 2023, undated older version, September 2025).

## Downloaded Forms

| Filename | Source URL | Description |

| form-1.pdf | https://www.blessinghealth.org/sites/default/files/users/user15/BH_Authorize_Release_Of_Medical_Records_4-2023.pdf | BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information (English, April 2023 version). Includes "Medical Record Number" header. Has witness signature requirement. |

## Key Observations
- The form is easy to find: directly linked from the Medical Records page under "For Patients."
- Blessing Health also offers an online records request tool (identity verification via driver's license photo).
- Multiple delivery options mentioned: pickup, mail, fax, email, secure email.
- A flat fee of $6.50 may apply for certain record requests.
- The form covers both patient access and third-party release (general authorization form, not patient-access-specific).

# Columbus Community Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Columbus Community Hospital
- **Location:** Columbus, NE
- **Website:** https://www.columbushosp.org (also https://columbusch.com)
- **Type:** Independent nonprofit community hospital

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Columbus Community Hospital Columbus NE authorization release health information form PDF"** — Did not return a direct link but confirmed the hospital exists.
2. **Web search for "Columbus Community Hospital Columbus Nebraska medical records release form"** — Successfully returned a direct link to the PDF at `https://www.columbushosp.org/Content/Uploads/ColumbusHosp/files/Release%20Med%20Records%2C%20Authorization.pdf` and also identified the patient forms page at `https://columbusch.com/patient-forms/`.
3. **Checked patient forms page** at `https://columbusch.com/patient-forms/` — The page mentions the Release of Information form and instructs patients to email it to release@columbusch.com, but does not include a direct download link on the page itself. The PDF is hosted on the older columbushosp.org domain.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.columbushosp.org/Content/Uploads/ColumbusHosp/files/Release%20Med%20Records%2C%20Authorization.pdf
- **Document type:** Authorization to Release Medical Records (ROI form)
- **Description:** Single-page PDF form titled "AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE MEDICAL RECORDS" (form ID: MR-1, dated 12/14). Includes fields for patient name/DOB, recipient name/address, dates of treatment, type of records to disclose (discharge summary, ER record, lab/x-ray, operative report, progress notes, H&P, x-ray films, consult report, complete record), purpose (treatment, insurance, follow-up, legal, personal, other), special authorization for substance abuse/mental health/HIV-AIDS information, patient acknowledgments (non-retaliation, re-disclosure risk, 12-month expiration, revocation rights), signature lines, and a Notice of Revocation section.
- **Text layer:** Yes — full text extractable via pdftotext
- **Pages:** 1
- **Fillable fields:** Not checked but appears to be a flat (non-fillable) PDF based on the text extraction showing blank lines

## Difficulties
- The hospital appears to operate two domains: `columbushosp.org` (older, hosts the PDF) and `columbusch.com` (newer website with navigation). The patient forms page on the newer site mentions the form but doesn't link directly to the PDF download.
- No bot blocking or download issues encountered — curl worked on first attempt.

## Summary
Found one ROI form (Authorization to Release Medical Records) hosted directly on the hospital's website. The form was relatively easy to find via web search. It is a standard single-page authorization form with checkboxes for record types and purposes, and includes HIPAA-related acknowledgment language.

# St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center
- **Location**: Phoenix, AZ
- **Website**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/arizona/locations/stjosephs
- **System**: Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health)

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center Phoenix "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct PDF results.
2. **Web search** for `Dignity Health "authorization" "release of information" medical records form filetype:pdf` — found the Arizona-specific general authorization form at `dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/arizona/medical-records-release3213448.pdf`.
3. **Web search** for `site:dignityhealth.org authorization release medical records` — found references to the St. Joseph's medical records page.
4. **Navigated** directly to the St. Joseph's medical records page: `https://www.dignityhealth.org/arizona/locations/stjosephs/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/medical-records` — this page links to two form types: a patient request form and a third-party authorization form (each in English and Spanish).

The **St. Joseph's medical records page** was the most productive source, providing links to the specific forms used at this facility.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/arizona/medical-records-release3213448.pdf
- **Document type**: General Arizona Dignity Health "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information"
- **Pages**: 3
- **File size**: 83,015 bytes
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Notes**: General authorization form for Arizona Dignity Health facilities. Includes checkboxes for types of records (ER, labs, billing, etc.), mental health, substance abuse, HIV, and genetic testing. Mentions revocation address in Chandler/Gilbert, AZ — may be a shared form across multiple Arizona facilities rather than St. Joseph's specifically. Found via web search, not linked from the St. Joseph's page.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/arizona/pdfs/ROI-SJHMC-PATIENTREQUEST(ENGLISH)%20(1).pdf
- **Document type**: St. Joseph's specific "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" (patient access form)
- **Pages**: 5
- **File size**: 144,221 bytes
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Notes**: This is the primary patient access form for St. Joseph's. It is specifically branded for SJHMC and lists multiple Dignity Health Arizona facilities (St. Joseph's, Westgate, Barrow Neurological Institute, Norton Thoracic Institute, etc.). Offers electronic delivery options (USB, CD, secure/unsecured email) and paper. Includes a fee schedule reference. Form number X-MR-4869, dated 02/22. Linked directly from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/arizona/third-party-english3213448.pdf
- **Document type**: "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (third-party release form)
- **Pages**: 2
- **File size**: 335,505 bytes
- **Has text layer**: Minimal (title only); effectively an image-only scanned form
- **Notes**: This is the third-party authorization form linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page. It is a scanned image PDF (CCITT-encoded images at 1200 DPI). Very little extractable text — only the title. Form number X-MR-4862, dated 03/13. Used when patients want records sent to a physician or other third party.

## Difficulties
- The third-party authorization form (form-3.pdf) is an image-only scan with virtually no text layer, making it inaccessible for text extraction or digital form-filling.
- The general Arizona authorization (form-1.pdf) found via web search appears to be a different/older form than what's linked from the St. Joseph's page — it references addresses in Chandler and Gilbert rather than St. Joseph's in Phoenix.
- The medical records page was easy to find: Home → Arizona → St. Joseph's → Patients and Visitors → For Patients → Medical Records (about 4-5 clicks from the main site).

## Summary
St. Joseph's Hospital provides two distinct forms for medical records: a **patient access request form** (form-2.pdf) for patients requesting their own records, and a **third-party authorization form** (form-3.pdf) for releasing records to others. The patient access form is notably comprehensive (5 pages) with electronic delivery options, while the third-party form is a basic scanned 2-page form. A general Arizona Dignity Health authorization form (form-1.pdf) was also found via web search.

- Web search for `"Brattleboro Memorial Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links on bmhvt.org.
- Web search for `"Brattleboro Memorial Hospital" "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same forms and found a second consent form.
- Web search for `site:bmhvt.org authorization release medical records` — found an additional DOCX version of the authorization form.

All three forms were found on the first round of searching. The hospital publishes multiple versions of ROI-related forms directly as uploaded files on their WordPress site.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.bmhvt.org/wp-content/uploads/ROI-Form-1.2025.pdf
- **File size:** 493,985 bytes (2 pages)
- **Description:** "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — the primary ROI form. Dated January 2025. Includes detailed instructions, patient rights language, fields for specifying records to release, from/to parties, record types (with checkboxes for psychiatric, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, reproductive health care, gender affirming care). Has fillable form fields. Mentions 12-month expiration. References HIM Department contact info (phone: 802-257-8258, fax: 802-257-8881).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.bmhvt.org/wp-content/uploads/Consent-Release-of-Medical-Information.pdf
- **File size:** 82,253 bytes (1 page)
- **Description:** "Request for Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information Release Authorization" — an older/simpler one-page ROI form. Includes fields for patient info, recipient info, purpose checkboxes (Family Education, Continuity of Care, Legal, Other), record type checkboxes (Discharge Summary, Lab Data, Progress Notes, H&P, ER Records, Operative Note, Nurse's Notes, X-rays). Has sensitive info checkboxes (Psychiatric, Drug/alcohol, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis). Expires six months from signing if no date specified, max one year. Appears to be a flat (non-fillable) PDF.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.bmhvt.org/wp-content/uploads/Authorization-to-share-Protected-Health-Information-Outgoing-Records.docx (converted from DOCX to PDF)
- **File size:** 59,715 bytes (3 pages, converted)
- **Description:** "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — very similar to form-1.pdf in content and structure but distributed as a Word document (.docx). Appears to be a slightly older version (does not include reproductive health care / gender affirming care language that form-1.pdf has). Originally a fillable Word document. Converted to PDF for consistent analysis.

## Difficulties Encountered
- No significant difficulties. All forms were publicly accessible without login, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering requirements.
- One form (form-3) was a .docx rather than PDF; converted with LibreOffice.
- The hospital has multiple versions of essentially the same form available, which may reflect different revision dates or distribution channels.

## Summary
Brattleboro Memorial Hospital makes ROI forms readily available. The primary form (form-1.pdf, dated 1/2025) is a modern, fillable PDF with comprehensive patient rights language. Form-2 appears to be an older, simpler version. Form-3 is a Word document version similar to form-1 but lacking some newer language. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

# CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital: ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital
- **Website**: https://www.centracare.com/locations/profile/long-prairie-hospital/
- **Location**: Long Prairie, MN
- **Parent System**: CentraCare (regional system based in St. Cloud, MN)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `CentraCare Long Prairie Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not find Long Prairie–specific forms but found CentraCare system-wide forms.
2. **Web search for CentraCare medical records release form**: Found direct PDF links and the medical records release page URL.
3. **Site-specific search**: `site:centracare.com authorization release medical records form` — confirmed the same system-wide forms.
4. **Navigated CentraCare website**: Visited https://www.centracare.com/patient-resources/medical-records-release/ which lists all available forms. Long Prairie Hospital uses the system-wide CentraCare authorization form (no facility-specific form).

## Difficulties

- **Bot blocking on curl**: Direct `curl` downloads returned "Access Denied" HTML pages (505 bytes). Had to use Chrome DevTools browser to navigate to PDF URLs and download via JavaScript `fetch()` within the page context.
- **No facility-specific form**: CentraCare uses a single "Universal Authorization" form across all facilities. Long Prairie Hospital is listed as one of the locations in the instructions document.

# Mayers Memorial Hospital District — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Mayers Memorial Hospital District
- **Website:** https://www.mayersmemorial.com
- **Location:** Fall River Mills, CA
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, government-owned

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Mayers Memorial Hospital District" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — did not find a direct link from the hospital website but identified a PatientPop-hosted PDF.
2. **Web search** for `"Mayers Memorial Hospital District" "medical records" "release form"` — found the Medical Records page URL and a reference to the PatientPop form.
3. **Web search** for `site:mayersmemorial.com authorization release form filetype:pdf` — no results indexed.
4. **Website navigation** — visited the Medical Records page (`/getpage.php?name=Medical_Records`): it only has descriptive text about the department (hours, phone number), with no downloadable form.
5. **Patients & Visitors page** (`/getpage.php?name=For_Patients`) — found links to: Patient Guide, Notice of Privacy Practices, Disclosure of Privacy Practices (PDF), Financial/Insurance, Issue Resolution Form, Surveys. No direct ROI/authorization form link.
6. **Notice of Privacy Practices page** — found PDFs for privacy practices in English and Spanish; no ROI form.
7. **Web search** for the PatientPop-hosted PDF association with Mayers Memorial — confirmed the form at `sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/223399.pdf` is associated with Mayers Memorial Hospital District's PatientPop/Tebra platform.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/223399.pdf
- **Document type:** Authorization for Release of Medical Records (ROI form)
- **Description:** A 1-page, simple authorization form for release of medical records. Contains fields for patient name, record number, address, DOB, information requested (free text), purpose of release (free text), and recipient information. Has a text layer (not a scan). Not branded with the Mayers Memorial logo/name — appears to be a generic form hosted on PatientPop's CDN. Found via web search; not directly linked from the hospital website's patient-facing pages.
- **File size:** 24,164 bytes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.mayersmemorial.com/docs/Disclosure_of_Health_Info.pdf
- **Document type:** Disclosure of Privacy Practices (NOT an ROI form)
- **Description:** A 2-page image-only scanned PDF. No text layer extractable via pdftotext. Linked from the Patients & Visitors page as "Disclosure of Privacy Practices." This is a privacy-related document, not a release of information authorization form.
- **File size:** 58,834 bytes

## Difficulties Encountered
- The hospital's website does not directly link to an ROI/authorization form from any patient-facing page.
- The Medical Records page describes the department but provides no downloadable form or instructions for requesting records release.
- The ROI form was only found via web search on a third-party CDN (PatientPop), not from the hospital website itself.
- The form is generic/unbranded — it does not specifically mention Mayers Memorial Hospital District.
- The Disclosure of Health Info PDF is an image-only scan with no text layer.

# Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name:** Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital
- **Website:** https://www.cottagehealth.org/locations/goleta-valley-cottage-hospital/
- **Location:** Goleta, CA
- **Parent System:** Cottage Health (regional nonprofit system including Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital, Cottage Rehabilitation Hospital)

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `"Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return a direct PDF link but identified Cottage Health as the parent system.
2. **Web search** for `"Cottage Health" "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` — found direct links to ROI forms on both `cottagehealth.org` and Azure Blob Storage (`stmlcottagehealthncus001.blob.core.windows.net`).
3. **Web search** for `site:cottagehealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records page URL and form links.
4. **Direct curl downloads** from `cottagehealth.org/app/files/public/...` URLs — **blocked by Akamai CDN** (returned "Access Denied" HTML).
5. **Direct curl downloads** from Azure Blob Storage URLs — **succeeded** without issue.
6. **Browser navigation** to `https://www.cottagehealth.org/patients-visitors/accessing-your-medical-records/` — confirmed the current form links and found updated versions (082025 vs 062025).

## What Worked
- The Azure Blob Storage URLs (`stmlcottagehealthncus001.blob.core.windows.net/public/...`) work with curl and don't have bot-blocking.
- The cottagehealth.org domain uses Akamai CDN which blocks curl requests even with a browser user-agent string.
- The medical records page is well-organized and easy to find (Home > Patients & Visitors > Accessing Your Medical Records).

## Difficulties
- **Akamai CDN blocking** on cottagehealth.org prevented direct PDF downloads from the main website URLs. The blob storage mirrors worked fine.
- The website has multiple versions of the same form at different URLs (062025 and 082025 versions), which could be confusing.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://stmlcottagehealthncus001.blob.core.windows.net/public/NS1405_Authorization_for_Disclosure_of_Health_Information_082025.pdf`
- **File size:** 303,889 bytes
- **Description:** Cottage Health "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" — English version (August 2025 revision). This is the current ROI form linked from the medical records page. It covers all Cottage Health facilities including Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Cottage Rehabilitation Hospital, Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital, and Cottage Urgent Care. 2-page form with text layer, checkboxes for facility selection, record types, delivery method (MyChart, pick-up, email, fax, mail), and expiration date.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://stmlcottagehealthncus001.blob.core.windows.net/public/NS1405_Authorization_for_Disclosure_of_Health_Information_082025_spanish.pdf`
- **File size:** 195,064 bytes
- **Description:** Cottage Health "Autorización Para la Revelación de Información Médica" — Spanish version of the same ROI form (August 2025 revision). Same content and structure as form-1 but in Spanish.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://stmlcottagehealthncus001.blob.core.windows.net/public/NS1405_Authorization_for_Disclosure_of_Health_Information_062025.pdf`
- **File size:** 349,042 bytes
- **Description:** Older version (June 2025 revision) of the same English ROI authorization form. Previously linked from the website but now replaced by the August 2025 version. Same basic structure and content.

## Additional Notes
- Cottage Health also offers an **online electronic request** option via Swellbox (https://www.swellbox.com/cottage-health-wizard.html) linked from the medical records page, which may be more convenient for patients than the PDF form.
- The form explicitly lists Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital as one of the facility options (checkbox).
- The form includes options for sensitive information categories (Mental Health, Chemical Dependency, HIV, Reproductive Healthcare) with appropriate California state law disclosures.
- Delivery methods include MyChart, pick-up (appointment only), email, fax, and mail.
- Authorization expires 12 months after signing if no date is specified.

# Valleywise Health Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `Valleywise Health "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — initial search did not surface direct links.
2. **Web search with "medical records" terms**: Searched for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — successfully found direct PDF URLs for both the general authorization form and the patient-specific access form.
3. **Site-scoped search**: Searched `site:valleywisehealth.org authorization release medical records` — found the patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` which links to the forms.

**What worked best**: The second web search with "medical records" and "release form" terms returned direct PDF URLs from the Valleywise Health website.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://valleywisehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VH_Form-43439-Auth-to-Use-or-Disclose-PHI_2024.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information (General ROI form)
- **Description**: 2-page PDF (Form #43439, DT7787). General authorization form for disclosing PHI to a designated third party. Includes sections for patient information, recipient details, information to be disclosed (pertinent info, entire chart, specific records, radiology, billing), exclusions for sensitive information (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse, genetic testing), and delivery method options (mail, MyChart, CD, USB, paper pick-up, email, fax). Has a fee notice referencing the website. Contains both English content.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://valleywisehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Form-45643-Patient-Request-For-Access-To-Protected-Health-Information_ENG_SPA.pdf
- **Document type**: Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information (Patient-specific access form)
- **Description**: 2-page bilingual (English/Spanish) PDF (Form #45643). Specifically designed for patients requesting access to their own records under HIPAA Right of Access. Allows selection of specific record types (all records, abstract, discharge summary, H&P, images, lab reports, medication records, nursing notes, pathology, progress notes, operative reports). References Valleywise Health form 43439 for sensitive information (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse, genetic testing). Includes HIM department contact info.

## Difficulties Encountered

- No significant difficulties. Both forms were publicly accessible PDFs hosted on the Valleywise Health WordPress site, downloadable without any bot blocking or authentication.
- The organization maintains two separate forms: one for general third-party disclosure (form-1) and one specifically for patient access (form-2), which is a good practice.

- `NHA Toledo Ohio "Neighborhood Health" patient forms download consent authorization PDF` — No results

### 2. Website Navigation (via browser)
- Navigated to https://nhainc.org and explored all main menu sections:
  - **Patient Resources** submenu: Services Provided, Financial Assistance, Sliding Fee Program, Schedule an Appointment, What To Bring, Patient Portal, Give Us Feedback — no medical records or forms page
  - **About** submenu: About NHA, Mission/Vision, Leadership, Awards, Blog, Malpractice Insurance, FAQs, Holidays, Contact Us, Nourish Cafe — no HIPAA or medical records page
  - **Health Resources** submenu: explored but no forms found
- Checked **Contact Us** page: mentions "Medical Records: Fax all medical records to 419.259.4503" and "Medical Records: ext. 1547/1524" but no downloadable form
- Checked **FAQs** page: no medical records information
- Checked **What To Bring To Your NHA Appointment** page: no form links
- Checked **Services Provided** page: mentions forms in English and Spanish are available but none linked for download
- Used on-site search for "medical records release" — returned "Nothing Found"

### 3. Site-Wide Analysis
- Fetched and reviewed full page sitemap (https://nhainc.org/page-sitemap.xml): ~45 pages listed, none related to medical records, HIPAA, privacy practices, or authorization forms
- Checked https://nhainc.org/privacy-policy/ — exists but is a basic WordPress website privacy policy, not a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices
- Checked https://nhainc.org/medical-records/ — 404 Not Found

- Tried multiple common URL patterns for ROI form PDFs in wp-content/uploads/ — all returned 404

### 4. Wayback Machine
- Checked https://web.archive.org/web/2024/https://nhainc.org/patient-forms/ — 404

- Checked https://web.archive.org/web/2023/https://nhainc.org/ — same site structure, no forms

### 5. JavaScript Page Analysis
- Used JavaScript on the homepage to search for all PDF links — found none

## Observations
- NHA has a medical records department (phone extensions 1547/1524 and fax 419.259.4503) but does not provide any downloadable forms on their website
- The website is primarily informational — services, locations, appointments, and community outreach
- They use FollowMyHealth as their patient portal (https://nhainc.followmyhealth.com/)
- The only downloadable PDFs found on the site were: employment application and sliding fee schedule/application
- As an FQHC, NHA serves a vulnerable population; the lack of online forms means patients must visit or call to obtain the ROI form
- The services page mentions "the development of forms in both English and Spanish" suggesting forms exist but are only provided in-person

## Downloaded Forms
None — no ROI or authorization form is publicly available on the NHA website.

- **Location:** Carson City, NV
- **Type:** FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `"Nevada Health Centers" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct hits to NHC-specific forms.
2. **Web search** for `"Nevada Health Centers" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — returned results for other Nevada organizations (Northern Nevada Medical Center, Health Plan of Nevada, Southern Nevada Health District) but not NHC specifically.
3. **Web search** for `site:nevadahealthcenters.org authorization release medical records` — **this worked**. Identified the forms page at https://www.nevadahealthcenters.org/forms/ with a direct link to the "Release of Medical Information" form.
4. **Navigated to the forms page** at https://www.nevadahealthcenters.org/forms/ — found a comprehensive patient forms page with multiple categories (General Forms, Dental Forms, Mammovan Forms, etc.). Three ROI-related forms were identified.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.nevadahealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FD-ALL.012es-Release-of-Medical-Info-7-25-2023.pdf
- **Listed as:** "Release of Medical Information (English/Spanish PDF)"
- **Description:** 1-page bilingual (English/Spanish) Release of Medical Information form. Titled "Nevada Health Centers, Inc. — RELEASE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION." Includes fields for patient name, DOB, authorization direction (To/From), name/address/phone/fax of recipient, checkboxes for record types (Medication List, Laboratory Results, Immunization Records, X-Ray, Provider Notes, Billing Records, Other), date range, confidential information opt-in/opt-out (AIDS/HIV, behavioral/mental health, alcohol/drug, social services), reason for request, revocation language, and signature fields. States "IF LEFT BLANK, THIS AUTHORIZATION WILL EXPIRE IN 120 DAYS." Has an office-use-only section at the bottom.
- **File size:** 410,025 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Technical notes:** Created in Adobe Illustrator; no extractable text layer (image-only vector PDF), no embedded fonts, no fillable form fields. Not a scan — it's a designed vector graphic.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.nevadahealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FD-ALL.011es-Authorization-to-Share-Information-2-4-22-2.pdf
- **Listed as:** "Authorization to Share Information Form (English/Spanish PDF)"
- **Description:** 2-page bilingual (English/Spanish) form titled "Nevada Health Centers, Inc. — AUTHORIZATION TO SHARE INFORMATION." Page 1 is English, page 2 is Spanish. References the Notice of Privacy Practices (FD-ALL.014e). Allows patients to authorize persons/entities to represent them and request information, or to terminate authorization to disclose to listed persons. Includes fields for names, relationships, DOBs. Checkboxes for what information can be shared: Medication refills, Referrals, All information pertaining to appointments, All medical information. Patient signature fields with minor/guardian provisions.
- **File size:** 463,726 bytes

### form-3.pdf

- **Listed as:** "WIC Release of Medical Information (English/Spanish PDF)"

- **File size:** 1,769,382 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Technical notes:** No extractable text layer, no embedded fonts, no fillable form fields.

## Difficulties
- **No text layer:** All three PDFs are created in Adobe Illustrator as vector graphics with no extractable text. `pdftotext` returns empty output. They are not scans — they are designed vector documents, but text is rendered as paths rather than font glyphs.
- **No fillable fields:** None of the forms have interactive form fields; they are designed to be printed and filled by hand.
- **Easy findability:** The forms page was straightforward to find — linked from the main site and clearly organized. The site search for "release" also surfaces the forms page.

## Summary
Nevada Health Centers publishes three ROI-related forms on their patient forms page. Form-1 is the primary general-purpose Release of Medical Information form. Form-2 is an Authorization to Share Information form (for designating persons who can access your records). Form-3 is a WIC-specific variant of the release form. All are bilingual English/Spanish, all lack text layers and fillable fields, and all are designed as print forms.

- **Description**: Banner Health's primary ROI form (form number 1200-0004, revision 06/2025). This is the current system-wide form used across Banner Health facilities. It includes patient information fields, release from/to sections, checkboxes for record types (medical records, billing, imaging, etc.), sensitive information opt-in (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse, genetic testing), delivery format options, and standard HIPAA authorization language. The form notes that patients can access most health information through the Banner Health patient portal. Expires 12 months from date signed.

- **Source URL**: https://www.bannerhealth.com/-/media/files/project/bh/locations/banner-university-medicine-family-medicine-clinic/1200-authorization-for-release-of-medical-information-roi.ashx
- **File size**: 89,850 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Hospital-specific Authorization for Release of Medical Information
- **Description**: An older hospital-specific version of the ROI form (form number 1200, revision 09/2017). This form is titled "Authorization for Release of Medical Information (Hospital)" and has a slightly different layout from the system-wide form. It includes similar fields but with some differences in structure (e.g., separate drug/alcohol treatment release section, employee verification fields). This appears to be a legacy form that may still be in use at some locations.

## Difficulties
- **form-1.pdf** had minor PDF parsing warnings (`xref num 71 not found`) from pdftotext, but text extraction worked fine.
- No bot blocking or login walls encountered. Both forms were directly downloadable via curl.
- Both forms are flat PDFs (not fillable), designed for print-and-sign workflow.

# Erlanger Health System — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Erlanger Health System
- **Website:** https://www.erlanger.org
- **Location:** Chattanooga, TN
- **Type:** Teaching hospital, regional system, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs:** Searched for `"Erlanger Health System" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not surface direct links.
2. **Web search for medical records release form:** Searched for `"Erlanger Health System" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found all three forms with direct download URLs.
3. **Site-scoped search:** Searched `site:erlanger.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the Medical Records page at `https://www.erlanger.org/patient-and-family-resources/patient-tools/medical-records` and the behavioral health form.

Strategy #2 was the most productive, surfacing all three forms in a single search.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.erlanger.org/-/media/erlanger-media/file/patienttools/19755-authorization-to-release-medical-information.ashx
- **File size:** 914,573 bytes
- **PDF version:** 1.6
- **Has text layer:** Yes
- **Description:** General "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" form for Erlanger Health System. Covers release from/to any party, includes sections for patient info, purpose of release, treatment dates, record types, format options (paper, CD, email), and signature/authorization. This is the standard ROI form for the system.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.erlangerbh.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2022/05/Medical-Records.pdf
- **File size:** 116,703 bytes
- **PDF version:** 1.4
- **Has text layer:** No (image-only scan)
- **Description:** "Authorization to Disclose Healthcare Information" form specifically for Erlanger Behavioral Health Hospital. This is a scanned image PDF with no extractable text. Covers behavioral health, substance use, and general medical records disclosure.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.erlanger.org/-/media/erlanger-media/file/murphy/2021-form---patient-request-for-access.ashx
- **File size:** 254,097 bytes
- **PDF version:** 1.6
- **Has text layer:** Yes
- **Description:** "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" form — specifically designed for patients requesting their own records (as opposed to third-party release). Includes options for record types (hospital summary, discharge summary, ER records, lab reports, radiology, etc.), delivery format (CD, email, paper copy), and date range selection. Originally from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital but applicable system-wide.

## Difficulties
- No significant difficulties. All forms were publicly available and downloadable without bot blocking or login walls.
- Form-2 (behavioral health) is hosted on a separate domain (erlangerbh.com) rather than the main erlanger.org site.
- Form-2 is an image-only scan with no text layer, making it inaccessible for text extraction.

## Summary
Erlanger Health System provides three distinct ROI-related forms: a general authorization for release (form-1), a behavioral health-specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a patient-specific access request form (form-3). The patient access form (form-3) is notably more patient-centered, offering specific record type checkboxes and delivery format options including email and CD. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

# Cottage Hospital - ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Cottage Hospital
- **Location:** Woodsville, NH 03785
- **Website:** https://www.cottagehospital.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit, Northeast

## Search Strategies

### Strategy 1: Web search for PDF forms
- Searched for `"Cottage Hospital" Woodsville NH "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf`
- Searched for `"Cottage Hospital" Woodsville NH "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`
- Searched for `site:cottagehospital.org authorization release medical records`
- **Result:** Web search identified two key PDFs:
  1. `RHC Medical Disclosure Form.pdf` — standalone authorization form (current version)
  2. `RHC New Patient Packet 11.6.2019.pdf` — contains an authorization form within a larger packet
  3. `RHC New Patient Packet Rev4_24.pdf` — newer version of the patient packet
- Also identified the HIM department page: `/department/medical-records-health-information-management-him`

### Strategy 2: Direct website access
- Attempted to access cottagehospital.org directly via curl and browser
- **Result:** Blocked by Cloudflare Turnstile challenge on every attempt. The checkbox verification could not be completed programmatically.

### Strategy 3: Google Cache
- Attempted to access cached version of the HIM page
- **Result:** Google also blocked the cache request (CAPTCHA)

### Strategy 4: Wayback Machine (successful)
- Searched Wayback Machine CDX API for `cottagehospital.org/uploads/files/*`
- Found archived copies of:
  - `AUTHORIZATIONFORDISCLOSURE.pdf` (multiple captures, latest 2024-07-05)
  - `RHC New Patient Packet 11.6.2019.pdf` (multiple captures, latest 2024-07-05)
- The newer `RHC Medical Disclosure Form.pdf` and `RHC New Patient Packet Rev4_24.pdf` were NOT archived
- Also found the "Becoming a Rowe Health Center Patient" page (archived 2025-02-08) which links to both forms
- Successfully downloaded both PDFs using the Wayback Machine `id_` (raw) URL format

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://web.archive.org/web/20240705122454id_/https://cottagehospital.org/uploads/files/AUTHORIZATIONFORDISCLOSURE.pdf`
- **Original URL:** `https://cottagehospital.org/uploads/files/AUTHORIZATIONFORDISCLOSURE.pdf`
- **File size:** 198,347 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Description:** "Authorization for Disclosure of Medical Information" — a standalone one-page authorization form from Cottage Hospital. Includes fields for patient name, DOB, recipient, purpose, record type selection (complete records, psychotherapy notes, mental illness, HIV, drug/alcohol), signature, witness, and expiration date. Created in Microsoft Word 2010 (2014). Has text layer, appears to be a digitally-created document (not a scan). Not fillable (no interactive form fields).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://web.archive.org/web/20240705112806id_/https://cottagehospital.org/uploads/files/RHC%20New%20Patient%20Packet%2011.6.2019.pdf`
- **Original URL:** `https://cottagehospital.org/uploads/files/RHC%20New%20Patient%20Packet%2011.6.2019.pdf`
- **File size:** 601,565 bytes
- **Pages:** 12
- **Description:** "RHC New Patient Packet" for Rowe Health Center (affiliated clinic across from Cottage Hospital). This 12-page packet contains multiple forms including an "Authorization for Disclosure of Medical Records" (a slightly updated version of the standalone form in form-1.pdf, this one explicitly mentions both Cottage Hospital and Rowe Health Center). The packet also includes welcome letter, patient demographics, insurance info, and other intake forms. Created in Microsoft Word 2016 (2019). Has text layer.

## Difficulties Encountered
1. **Cloudflare Turnstile blocking:** The cottagehospital.org website uses Cloudflare's Turnstile challenge, which blocked all automated access (curl, browser with DevTools). Multiple attempts to complete the checkbox verification failed.
2. **Google Cache also blocked:** Google's cache access was also blocked by CAPTCHA.
3. **Wayback Machine HTML wrappers:** Initial attempts to download from Wayback Machine returned HTML wrapper pages instead of raw PDFs. Had to use the `id_` URL modifier to get raw content.
4. **Newer forms not archived:** The current versions of the forms (`RHC Medical Disclosure Form.pdf` and `RHC New Patient Packet Rev4_24.pdf`) were not captured by the Wayback Machine, so we only have the older versions.

## Notes
- The hospital's current website (as seen in the Wayback archive) links to the ROI form from the "Becoming a Rowe Health Center Patient" page under Step 2: "Transfer your medical records by completing the Authorization for Disclosure of Medical Information."
- The hospital has a dedicated Medical Records / HIM department page at `/department/medical-records-health-information-management-him`
- The form appears to be a general authorization for disclosure rather than a patient-access-specific form
- Both forms have text layers (digitally created in Microsoft Word, not scans)

# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Newton-Wellesley Hospital
- **Location**: Newton, MA
- **Website**: https://www.nwh.org/
- **Parent System**: Mass General Brigham (formerly Partners HealthCare)

## Search Strategies

### What worked
1. **Web search** for `Newton-Wellesley Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately returned the direct PDF URL on the Mass General Brigham content delivery network.
2. **Navigating the NWH website** → Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records page (https://www.nwh.org/patients-and-visitors/billing-and-records/medical-records) — links to the parent MGB system's medical records page.
3. **MGB parent system page** (https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/patient-care/patient-visitor-information/medical-records) — has an accordion for Newton-Wellesley Hospital with English, Spanish, and Portuguese versions of the authorization form.

### Retrieval difficulty: Easy
The form was findable via a single web search. The NWH website also clearly links to it through its Medical Records page, which directs to the MGB system-wide medical records page.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/content/dam/mgb-global/en/patient-care/patient-and-visitor-information/medical-records/documents/nwh/medical-records-release-nwh-english.pdf
- **File size**: 574,813 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information
- **Description**: Current official NWH authorization form branded under Mass General Brigham. 2-page PDF with text layer. Includes patient info section, permission/purpose checkboxes (Medical Care, Insurance, Legal, Personal, School, Other), delivery method options (Patient Gateway, Secure Email, Fax, Paper Copy via Mail), detailed record type selection with date fields (clinic visit notes, lab reports, operative reports, radiology, pathology, etc.), and sections for sensitive information authorization (substance use, mental health, HIV, genetics). Form number MGB00087 (06/24). Expires 6 months from date signed.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.nwh.org/media/file/PHS_HIM_RELEASE-ENG.pdf
- **File size**: 102,258 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Older version of ROI / Authorization form
- **Description**: Legacy Partners HealthCare System (PHS) authorization form for release of protected or privileged health information. Older format, smaller file size. Found referenced in web search results as an alternative URL. This appears to be a predecessor version of the current MGB form.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The form was easy to find via web search and through the organization's website navigation.
- NWH's medical records page does not directly host a PDF download link — it instead links to the MGB parent system's page where users must expand the "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" accordion to find the download link.
- An older legacy form still exists at the nwh.org domain under the PHS (Partners HealthCare System) branding.

# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" — returned direct PDF URLs from Advocate Health's website, including EAP forms and the AMG (Advocate Medical Group) authorization form.
2. **Web search** for "Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital medical records release form PDF Downers Grove" — confirmed the medical records page URL at advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records.
3. **Web search** for "site:advocatehealth.com authorization release medical records form" — found additional form variants including AMG-specific and EAP forms.
4. **Navigated** to https://www.advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records via browser — this was the most productive source, revealing the official patient-facing forms with direct download links.

## What Worked Best

Navigating the Advocate Health medical records page directly was the most effective strategy. The page clearly lists two primary forms (Patient Request form and Authorization to Release form) with PDF download links, plus a Spanish version and instructions document. The web searches also surfaced direct PDF links but some were for EAP (Employee Assistance Program) forms rather than the hospital's patient medical records forms.

## Difficulties Encountered

- The organization is part of a large health system (Advocate Health / Advocate Aurora Health), so forms are centralized at the system level rather than hospital-specific.
- Multiple form variants exist across different parts of the organization (EAP vs. hospital vs. AMG), which could confuse patients.
- No difficulties with bot blocking or JavaScript rendering — all PDFs downloaded successfully via curl.

## Downloaded Forms

- **Description**: "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — the general authorization for disclosing PHI to third parties. Covers medical records, imaging, and billing. Includes checkboxes for mutual exchange (behavioral health), record types, and purposes. This is the standard ROI/authorization form used across Advocate Health hospitals including Good Samaritan.

### form-6.pdf

- **form-4.pdf**: Patient-specific records request form (for patients requesting their own records)
- **form-5.pdf**: General authorization to release PHI (for third-party disclosures)

Both are linked prominently from the medical records page. The hospital also has a Spanish-language version (form-6) and an instructions document (form-7). The EAP forms (form-1, form-3) and AMG form (form-2) are separate and serve different organizational functions.

# El Rio Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: El Rio Health (El Rio Community Health Center)
- **Location**: Tucson, AZ
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit
- **Website**: https://elrio.org

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI/authorization form**: Multiple queries including `"El Rio Health" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf`, `"El Rio Health" "medical records" "release form" PDF`, and variations. No direct PDF link to an ROI form was found.

2. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:elrio.org authorization release medical records` — no relevant results.

3. **Website navigation**: Navigated the full El Rio Health website including:
   - Homepage (elrio.org)
   - For Patients section (elrio.org/for-patients/)
   - Patient Information page (elrio.org/for-patients/patient-information/) — only has Welcome Booklet, Compliance Booklet, Sliding Fee Scale, and Surprise Billing notice
   - Contact Us page (elrio.org/contact-us/)
   - Extracted all navigation links from the header — no "Medical Records," "Forms," or "Release of Information" page exists

4. **Sitemap analysis**: Checked `page-sitemap.xml` — no medical records or forms page listed.

5. **WordPress upload directory probing**: Tried ~12 common filename patterns for authorization forms in `/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/` and `/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/` — none found (all returned 404).

6. **MyChart portal**: Checked the El Rio MyChart FAQ page — standard Epic MyChart FAQ with no mention of downloadable ROI forms.

7. **Wayback Machine**: Checked for historical versions of medical records or authorization pages — no archived versions found.

8. **Compliance booklet review**: Downloaded and reviewed the 16-page compliance booklet (their HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices). It describes patient rights to access records but does not contain an actual authorization form.

## What Was Found

El Rio Health does **not** publish a downloadable ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form on their public website. Their approach to medical records access is:
- **MyChart portal** for online record viewing/downloading
- **Phone contact** at (520) 670-3909 to request forms
- **In-person** at clinic locations

The only patient-facing documents available for download are:
- New Patient Welcome Booklet
- New Patient Compliance Booklet (HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices)
- Sliding Fee Scale information
- Surprise Medical Bills notice

## Downloaded Files

| Filename | Source URL | Document Type |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| form-1.pdf | https://elrio.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/compliance-booklet-eng.pdf | HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices / Compliance Booklet (16 pages). Describes patient rights including right to access records, but is NOT an ROI authorization form. |

## Difficulties Encountered

- **No ROI form published online**: Despite extensive searching across the website, web search engines, and the Wayback Machine, El Rio Health does not make an ROI/authorization form available for download.
- **Minimal patient forms section**: The Patient Information page has very few downloadable documents (only booklets and notices, no actionable forms).
- **No medical records page**: Unlike many health systems, El Rio Health has no dedicated "Medical Records" or "Health Information Management" page on their website.
- **Portal-centric approach**: El Rio directs patients to MyChart for records access, but the portal requires authentication and doesn't provide a public-facing ROI form.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard/Impossible

No ROI form is publicly available for download from El Rio Health's website. The compliance booklet was downloaded as the closest relevant document for study purposes.

# Cone Health — ROI Form Collection Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Cone Health
- **Location:** Greensboro, NC
- **Website:** https://www.conehealth.com
- **Type:** Teaching hospital, regional system, nonprofit, South census region

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Cone Health release of information form" and "Cone Health authorization medical records PDF" — identified the main Medical Records page and several direct PDF URLs.
2. **Website navigation** to https://www.conehealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records/ — this is the primary page listing forms for requesting medical records. Found 3 PDFs linked directly.
3. **Web search results** also surfaced a CHMG (Cone Health Medical Group) Release of Information form not linked from the main medical records page.

## Difficulties

- **Bot protection:** Cone Health's website blocks basic `curl` requests with "Access Denied" HTML responses (~500 bytes). Adding full browser-like headers (User-Agent, Sec-Ch-Ua, Sec-Fetch-* headers) resolved this for most URLs. For the initial downloads, browser-based fetch via Chrome DevTools was required.
- **URL redirects:** The Request for Amendment form URL (`/app/files/public/3334/...`) redirects to a UUID-based URL (`/app/files/public/7af00a9b-d7fd-40dc-ba5a-dff91c8192a7/...`).

## Downloaded Forms

- **Size:** 114,330 bytes (2 pages, PDF 1.3)
- **Description:** Spanish-language version of the HIPAA Authorization form (Autorización de HIPAA para el Uso/Divulgación de Información Médica Protegida). Same content as form-1 in Spanish.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.conehealth.com/app/files/public/7af00a9b-d7fd-40dc-ba5a-dff91c8192a7/Request-for-Amendment-of-Health-Information.pdf
- **Size:** 13,430 bytes (1 page, PDF 1.5)
- **Description:** Request for Amendment of Health Information form. Not an ROI form — this is for patients requesting corrections/amendments to their medical records. Included as it was published on the same Medical Records page.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.conehealth.com/app/files/public/5cb84c2e-39ff-4feb-8171-ffcf634002cf/CHMG-Release-of-Information-Form.pdf
- **Size:** 41,504 bytes (PDF 1.6)
- **Description:** Cone Health Medical Group (CHMG) Request & Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information. This is a separate ROI form specifically for CHMG physician practices/outpatient settings. Found via web search but not linked from the main Medical Records page. Contains similar authorization language but is formatted differently from the hospital HIPAA Authorization form.

## Additional Notes

- The Medical Records page notes that behavioral health records require calling the HIM department directly (336-832-8677) due to 42 CFR Part 2 regulations. No separate behavioral health authorization form is published online.
- Cone Health has two distinct ROI forms: one for the hospital system (form-1/form-2) and one for the medical group practices (form-4).
- All forms were verified as valid PDFs with extractable text using `pdftotext`.

# San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center authorization release health information form PDF"** — Immediately found a direct link to the 2024 updated authorization form PDF on their website.
2. **Web search for "San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center medical records release form PDF"** — Found a second, older version of the authorization form at a different URL.
3. **Web search for "site:sanluisvalleyhealth.org authorization release medical records"** — Confirmed both forms and provided additional context about submission process.
4. **Navigated the Medical Records page** at `https://www.sanluisvalleyhealth.org/patient-center/medical-records/` — Found the current English form and a Spanish version linked directly from this page.

## What Worked

The forms were very easy to find. Web search immediately returned direct PDF links. The organization's Medical Records page clearly links to both the English and Spanish authorization forms. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues encountered.

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Ben Taub Hospital Harris Health "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF` — did not return direct PDF links but pointed to Harris Health's website.
2. **Web search** for `site:harrishealth.org authorization release medical records form` — found the main authorization form PDF URL and medical records page. Also surfaced a separate marketing/media authorization form.
3. **Fetched the Medical Records page** at `https://www.harrishealth.org/patients-hh/Pages/medical-records.aspx` — confirmed the authorization form link and documented the request process (mail, fax, email, or in-person drop-off).

- **Source URL:** https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/280342-authorization-for-use-request-and-disclosure-of-phi.pdf
- **File size:** 430,439 bytes
- **Initial impression:** This is the primary ROI form — "Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." It covers all Harris Health facilities including Ben Taub Hospital. Includes patient information fields, recipient details, date range selection, facility selection (Ben Taub, LBJ, clinics), record type checkboxes (complete medical record, billing, ER, operative reports, radiology, lab, etc.), format options (paper), and sensitive information consent (drug/alcohol, psychiatric, HIV/AIDS). Has a text layer (not a scan).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/282758-authorization-for-marketing-and-educational-use-english.pdf
- **File size:** 594,254 bytes
- **Initial impression:** This is a separate "Authorization for Release of Information — Media, Marketing and Educational Use" form. Not an ROI form for patient access to their own records; this is for authorizing Harris Health to use patient information for media, marketing, or educational purposes. Includes consent for recordings (video, photo, audio), sensitive information release, and expiration/withdrawal provisions.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The forms were easy to find through web search and directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, no login walls, no JavaScript rendering issues.
- The medical records page is straightforward and clearly explains the request process.
- Only one ROI form was found (form-1.pdf); the second form (form-2.pdf) is a marketing authorization, not a patient records request form.

2. **Navigated the website** to the Records Request page, which had a direct "Click Here" link to the PDF form.

The form was very easy to find — one click from the Records Request page, which itself is accessible from the main site navigation.

## Downloaded Forms

# Millinocket Regional Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Millinocket Regional Hospital
- **Website**: https://www.mrhme.org
- **Location**: Millinocket, ME
- **Type**: Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search: `"Millinocket Regional Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf`** — No direct results found.
2. **Web search: `"Millinocket Regional Hospital" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`** — No direct results found.
3. **Web search: `site:mrhme.org authorization release medical records`** — **Success.** Found a direct link to the PDF form at `https://www.mrhme.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Release-of-Information-for-Medical-Records.pdf`. The search also surfaced the Patient Resources page and Privacy & Security page.

The third search strategy (site-scoped search) was most effective.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mrhme.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Release-of-Information-for-Medical-Records.pdf
- **File size**: 31,717 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Has text layer**: Yes (3,739 characters extracted via pdftotext)
- **Initial impression**: This is the hospital's official **Authorization to Release Health Care Information** form. It is a general-purpose ROI form (not patient-access-specific). The form includes:
  - Patient identification fields (name, DOB)
  - Sender and recipient institution fields
  - Checklist of record types (a–r) including H&P, lab results, medication list, progress notes, treatment plans, discharge summary, etc.
  - Reason for release (continuing care or other)
  - Special consent sections for drug/alcohol abuse, HIV/AIDS, and psychiatric records
  - Signature lines for patient, representative, and witness
  - Expiration date field
  - Note about minors (ages 14–17) and representative capacity
- **Fillable fields**: Appears to be a flat PDF (no interactive form fields); designed for print and manual completion.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The first two search strategies (non-site-scoped) did not return the form directly, but the site-scoped search found it immediately.
- The form URL contains a 2014 date in the path (`/2014/06/`), suggesting it has been hosted on the site for a long time and may not have been updated recently.
- No difficulties with downloading — curl worked on the first attempt with no bot blocking.

# Community Health Centers of Burlington — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release form PDFs** — searched for CHCB + "authorization" + "release" + "health information" + PDF. First search returned generic results without a direct link.
2. **Site-scoped search** — searched `site:chcb.org medical records release authorization form`. This immediately returned a direct link to the 2024 fillable consent form hosted on their WordPress site.
3. **Follow-up search for additional forms** — searched for other uploads on chcb.org and found a verbal-only consent form and a notice of privacy practices.

## What Worked

The site-scoped web search was the most effective strategy, immediately surfacing the direct PDF URL on the CHCB WordPress site (`/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/`). The forms page at https://www.chcb.org/forms/ did not render content (likely JavaScript-rendered), but direct PDF links were discoverable via search.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.chcb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consent-to-Disclose-Health-Information-2024-FILLABLE.pdf
- **Document type**: ROI / Consent to Disclose Health Information form (2024, fillable)
- **Description**: "Authorization to Send Health Information" — a comprehensive consent form for releasing medical, mental health/psychiatric, and dental records. Includes fields for patient info, reason for release, record types, date ranges, sender/recipient info, expiration, and signature. References HIPAA. Revised November 2023. This is the primary ROI form for CHCB.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.chcb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Verbal-Consent-to-Disclose-Health-Information-FILLABLE.pdf
- **Document type**: Verbal-only consent form (2024, fillable)
- **Description**: "Authorization for Verbal Communication (Only)" — a companion form that authorizes CHCB to share health information verbally with a designated person, but explicitly states no paper records will be sent. Similar structure to form-1 but limited to verbal communication only.

## Difficulties

- The CHCB forms page (https://www.chcb.org/forms/) did not render useful content when fetched — likely requires JavaScript. However, this was not a barrier since the PDFs were directly discoverable via web search.
- No difficulties with download; both PDFs downloaded cleanly via curl and contain extractable text with fillable fields.

## Additional Forms Found (Not Downloaded)

- **Consent-to-Disclose-FINAL.pdf** (2019 version) — older version of the same consent form, superseded by the 2024 version
- **Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-2026_FINAL.pdf** — privacy practices notice, not an ROI form

# The Valley Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** The Valley Hospital
- **Website:** https://www.valleyhealth.com
- **Location:** Paramus, NJ
- **Type:** Community hospital, independent, nonprofit, Northeast

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Valley Hospital" Paramus NJ authorization release health information form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links on valleyhealth.com and mrocorp.com.
2. **Web search** for `"Valley Hospital" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — confirmed the same forms and found the Home Care variant.
3. **Site-specific search** `site:valleyhealth.com medical records authorization release form` — confirmed no additional forms beyond those already found.
4. **Website navigation** — visited https://www.valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records. The page now directs patients to an online records request tool (identity verification via driver's license photo) rather than linking to downloadable PDF forms. However, the PDF files remain accessible at their direct URLs.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.valleyhealth.com/sites/default/files/Patient%20%26%20Visitors/Medical%20Records/Authorization_VMG_FINAL_July%2031%202023.pdf
- **File size:** 208,995 bytes
- **Description:** Authorization for Release of Patient Records & Information — Valley Medical Group (VMG). Dated July 31, 2023. Current version. Multi-section form with patient info, recipient info, delivery method options (fax, paper, CD, encrypted/unencrypted email), purpose of disclosure, record type checkboxes (labs, physicals, notes, imaging, etc.), and sensitive information consent section (HIV, mental health, substance use). Has text layer.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.valleyhealth.com/sites/default/files/Patient%20%26%20Visitors/Medical%20Records/Authorization_VMG%20(FINAL%20MAY%204%202023%20with%20Instructions%20Update).pdf
- **File size:** 199,154 bytes
- **Description:** Authorization for Release of Patient Records & Information — Valley Medical Group (VMG). Dated May 4, 2023. Earlier version with updated instructions. Very similar content to form-1 but slightly different layout. Has text layer.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://mrocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Autho_VHNJ.pdf
- **File size:** 24,059 bytes
- **Description:** Authorization for Release of Patient Records & Information — The Valley Hospital (Ridgewood, NJ). Hospital-specific form (not VMG). Older format hosted on MRO Corp (medical records outsourcing company) website. Includes barcode, mentions $1/page fee for personal use copies, NJ 30-day compliance period, and requires ID for pickup. Has text layer with some barcode artifacts.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.valleyhealth.com/sites/default/files/Patient%20%26%20Visitors/Medical%20Records/Authorization_Home%20Care%20Release%20of%20Information%20(FINAL%20Rev%20April%202023).pdf
- **File size:** 753,227 bytes
- **Description:** Authorization for Release of Patient Records & Information — Valley Home Care. Similar structure to the VMG forms but specific to home care services. Includes delivery method options (fax, paper, USB, encrypted/unencrypted email). Has text layer.

## Difficulties
- **No direct links on the medical records page:** The main medical records page (https://www.valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records) no longer links to downloadable authorization forms. Instead, it directs patients to an online records request tool. The PDFs are still hosted on the site but are not prominently linked.
- **Multiple entities:** Valley Health System encompasses The Valley Hospital, Valley Medical Group (VMG), and Valley Home Care, each with their own authorization form. The VMG form appears to be the most current and comprehensive.
- **MRO Corp form may be outdated:** form-3.pdf is hosted on mrocorp.com (a third-party records management company) and appears to be an older version of The Valley Hospital's form, possibly superseded by the VMG forms.

# Grady Memorial Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Grady Memorial Hospital
- **Website**: https://www.gradyhealth.org
- **Location**: Atlanta, GA
- **System**: Grady Health System (government/public hospital)

## Search Strategy
1. Web search for `Grady Memorial Hospital Atlanta GA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found the main authorization form PDF and the medical records page.
2. Web search for `Grady Memorial Hospital Atlanta "medical records" "release form" request` — confirmed the first result and revealed additional PDF URLs including an older PHI form and a combined instructions+form document.

Both searches were effective on the first try. The forms are directly linked from the Grady Health System website at https://www.gradyhealth.org/medical-records/.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.gradyhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/medicalrecords.pdf
- **File size**: 195,547 bytes
- **Description**: "Patient Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — the current/primary ROI form. Includes patient info fields, from/to disclosure fields, checkboxes for record types (hospital visits, office visits, diagnostic reports), purpose of disclosure, and signature fields. Appears to be the main form currently linked from the medical records page.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.gradyhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Grady-PHI-form.pdf
- **File size**: 144,601 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — an older version of the authorization form (2-page format). Has similar content to form-1 but different layout. The PDF has some structural issues (xref errors reported by pdftotext). Includes a page with documentation requirements for different requester types (patients, representatives, third parties).

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.gradyhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Medical-Records-Requests-combined.pdf
- **File size**: 463,478 bytes
- **Description**: Combined document that includes: (1) a cover page with instructions for medical records requests during COVID-19, including drop-off, mail, and electronic submission options, fees ($6.50 max), and processing times; (2) the Authorization for Disclosure of PHI form (same as form-2); and (3) documentation requirements page. This is the most comprehensive document as it bundles instructions with the form.

## Difficulties
- No significant difficulties. Forms were easy to find via web search and directly downloadable as PDFs without any bot blocking or login requirements.
- form-2.pdf had minor PDF structural issues (xref errors) but text was still extractable.
- The medical records page (https://www.gradyhealth.org/medical-records/) provides clear instructions and direct links to the form.

# Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers (BJKPHC)
- **Website**: https://phcenters.org
- **Location**: St. Louis, MO
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit
- **Parent org**: People's Family of Corporations (https://peoplesfamilystl.org)

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI/authorization form PDFs**: Multiple searches including `"People's Health Centers" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf`, `site:phcenters.org authorization release`, and variations. None returned a downloadable ROI form.

2. **Direct website navigation**: Browsed phcenters.org via Chrome DevTools. The site has pages for About, Services, Locations, Careers, Education, Contact. Found a dedicated "Requests for Release of Health Information" page at https://phcenters.org/release-of-health-information/.

3. **Release of Health Information page**: This page provides only contact information for submitting records requests — no downloadable form:
   - Fax: (314) 367-8009 (Main), (314) 367-2025 (Behavioral Health)
   - Mail: 5701 Delmar Blvd, St. Louis MO 63112
   - Patient Portal: Medfusion/NextGen portal login
   - In-person: Photo ID required

4. **WordPress uploads directory crawl**: Directory listing was enabled on phcenters.org. Systematically crawled all upload directories across sites/2, sites/3, sites/4 for years 2022-2026, all months. Found ~30 PDFs total (newsletters, benefits booklets, scholarship applications, flyers, etc.) but zero ROI/authorization forms.

5. **Parent organization site (peoplesfamilystl.org)**: Checked HIPAA notice page and Patient Rights page. Found links to two PDFs:
   - HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP-2.pdf) — successfully downloaded
   - Patient Rights and Responsibilities (2019) — returns 500 Internal Server Error

6. **Wayback Machine**: Checked CDX API for all PDFs ever archived from phcenters.org. Found ~17 historical PDFs, none of which are ROI/authorization forms. Also checked archived versions of the release-of-health-information page — it has always been text-only instructions with no form link.

7. **Google/Bing searches with various queries**: Multiple attempts with different search terms all confirmed no publicly available ROI form.

## What Was Found

### No ROI Form Available Online
Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers does **not** publish a downloadable ROI/Authorization form on their website. The organization's approach is to handle records requests through:
- In-person visits (photo ID required)
- Fax or mail submissions
- Patient portal (login required)

There is no publicly accessible PDF, Word document, or online form for authorizing release of health information.

### Downloaded Documents

#### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://peoplesfamilystl.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NPP-2.pdf
- **Document type**: HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices
- **Pages**: 10
- **Description**: The organization's Notice of Privacy Practices as required by HIPAA. Describes how PHI may be used/disclosed, patient rights regarding PHI, and organizational obligations. This is NOT an ROI form but is the most closely related publicly available document.

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **No downloadable ROI form exists**: The primary difficulty — the organization simply does not publish this form online.
2. **Patient Rights PDF broken**: The Patient Rights and Responsibilities PDF at peoplesfamilystl.org returns a 500 Internal Server Error, suggesting the file has been deleted or corrupted on the server.
3. **Limited online presence for patient forms**: Despite having a dedicated "Release of Health Information" page, it only provides submission channels (fax, mail, in-person, portal) without a downloadable form.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard/Impossible

No ROI form was found despite exhaustive searching. The organization appears to only distribute the form in-person or through their patient portal (which requires login credentials).

# UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — returned direct PDF URLs from uchealth.org.
2. **Web search** for `UCHealth "medical records" "release form" request records PDF` — returned additional PDF URLs including one from uchealth.com (different org).
3. **Navigated** the UCHealth medical records page at `https://www.uchealth.org/access-my-health-connection/medical-records-uchealth/` — found the current official form linked directly, plus an online request portal (MRO Express).

The medical records page was easy to find and clearly organized with download links, online request option, and contact info for each UCHealth location.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.uchealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PATVIS-Authorization-to-Disclose-Protected-Health-Information.pdf
- **File size**: 483,507 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: Older UCHealth "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" form. Lists University of Colorado Hospital, Poudre Valley Hospital, Medical Center of the Rockies, Memorial Hospital, and Colorado Health Medical Group. Includes checkboxes for record types, purpose of request, and signature requirements. Has text layer. Appears to be a 2017-era version.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.uchealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RSO-Patient-Info-Release.pdf
- **File size**: 234,916 bytes
- **Description**: UCHealth "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Patient Information" form. Specifically references University of Colorado Hospital. Includes fields for obtaining from and releasing to facilities, record type checkboxes, and mentions that once disclosed, information may no longer be protected by UCH. Appears to be a 2018-era form variant, possibly for inter-facility transfers.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.uchealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UCH-ROI-01-Release-of-Information-040621-Final1.pdf
- **File size**: 155,083 bytes (2 pages)
- **Description**: **Wrong organization.** This is from UC Health Cincinnati (University of Cincinnati Medical Center), NOT UCHealth Colorado. The uchealth.com domain belongs to the Cincinnati system, while uchealth.org is the Colorado system. The form references Daniel Drake Center, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, and West Chester Hospital. Downloaded because the web search returned this URL; kept per study protocol.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://uchealth-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21090243/HIM19000.1025-Authorization-to-Disclose-PHI.pdf

Includes electronic delivery options (email, My Health Connection portal, PowerShare for radiology images). Has fillable checkboxes and text fields. This is the most current version, linked from the official medical records request page.

## Difficulties

- **Domain confusion**: uchealth.org (Colorado) vs uchealth.com (Cincinnati) are different health systems. The .com URL returned a form from the wrong organization.
- **No other significant difficulties**: Forms were easy to find via both web search and direct website navigation. The medical records page is clearly organized with direct PDF download links.

## Summary

UCHealth makes their ROI form readily available online. The current form (form-4.pdf) is linked directly from their medical records page and includes modern features like electronic delivery options and a comprehensive facility list. They also offer an online request portal through MRO Express. The form was found within 1-2 clicks from the main website navigation.

# Mercy General Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Mercy General Hospital
- **Location**: Sacramento, CA
- **Parent System**: Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health)
- **Website**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/sacramento/locations/mercy-general-hospital

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search**: `Mercy General Hospital Sacramento "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found direct PDF links for the general authorization form and a medical group patient access form.
2. **Web search**: `Dignity Health "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` — confirmed the above and found additional forms including a hospital-specific patient access form.
3. **Web search**: `site:dignityhealth.org sacramento "medical record requests" "patient access" form` — found a third form (hospital-level patient access request) at a different URL.

The Dignity Health Sacramento medical records page (https://www.dignityhealth.org/sacramento/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/medical-record-requests) is the main landing page for requesting records from Mercy General Hospital and sibling facilities.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/sacramento/pdfs/Use-and-Disclosure-General-Authorization-PHI.pdf
- **File size**: 344,720 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — general ROI/authorization form used across Dignity Health Sacramento facilities (MGH, MHF, MSJ, MTH, SNM, WMH). This is a third-party release authorization form allowing disclosure of PHI to specified recipients. 2 pages, has text layer, includes checkboxes for record types (mental health, substance abuse, HIV, various clinical record types, billing). Not patient-access-specific — designed for releasing records to others.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/medical-groups/sac-patient-access-request-form.pdf
- **File size**: 155,999 bytes
- **Description**: "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — specific to Mercy Medical Group (the physician group affiliated with Dignity Health Sacramento). This is a patient access form (patient requesting their own records). 2 pages, has text layer, offers multiple delivery options (mail, pick up, email, flash drive, fax). Includes fee disclosure and special rules for sensitive records (HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse).

### form-3.pdf

- **File size**: 126,483 bytes
- **Description**: "Patient's Request For Access To Protected Health Information" — hospital-level patient access form for Dignity Health Sacramento facilities. Similar to form-2 but for the hospital (not the medical group). Offers delivery via paper, USB drive, CD, secure email, or unsecured email. Includes record type checkboxes and special provisions for sensitive records. Has text layer.

## Failed Downloads

- **URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/sacramento/-/media/cm/media/documents/patients-and-visitors/patient-access-request-form.ashx — returned 404 Not Found.

## Difficulties
- The organization has two separate tracks for records: hospital records (Mercy General Hospital) and medical group records (Mercy Medical Group). Each has its own patient access form.
- One URL from search results returned a 404, suggesting some forms have been moved or consolidated.
- Forms are reasonably easy to find — linked from the Dignity Health Sacramento medical records page.

## Summary
Three forms were successfully downloaded:
1. A general third-party authorization/ROI form (form-1.pdf)
2. A medical group patient access form (form-2.pdf)
3. A hospital patient access form (form-3.pdf)

Retrieval difficulty: **easy** — forms were findable via web search and directly linked from the organization's website.

The web search for "Emory Healthcare medical records release form authorization PDF" was most effective, directly surfacing the PDF URLs. The medical records page at emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records is well-organized and clearly links to all relevant forms.

## Difficulties
- Minor: The current English ROI form (revised 11-2025) references "Emory Hospital Warner Robins – Clinic" and "Emory Hospital Perry – Clinic" prominently in the text extraction, suggesting it's a unified form covering all Emory Healthcare facilities including recently acquired ones.
- The form-1.pdf text extraction via pdftotext shows somewhat limited content because much of the form is in fillable fields; the actual form has more structure than the plain text extraction reveals.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf

They offer both English and Spanish fillable PDF authorization forms (recently updated November 2025). Notable features include EHI Export as a delivery option and an electronic request platform. The forms cover all Emory Healthcare facilities system-wide.

# Boone County Health Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Boone County Health Center
- **Location:** Albion, NE
- **Website:** https://boonecohealth.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit, Midwest

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `"Boone County Health Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found a direct PDF link to an older (August 2017) version of the ROI form hosted on WordPress uploads.
2. **Web search** for `"Boone County Health Center" Albion Nebraska medical records release form` — confirmed the same PDF URL and identified the General Information page as the forms landing page.
3. **Site-specific search** for `site:boonecohealth.org patient forms medical records` — identified the General Information page URL.
4. **Browsed the website** at `https://boonecohealth.org/patient-resources-2/general-information-3/` using browser — found the "Patient Forms" section with a link to a newer .docx version of the ROI form (uploaded Feb 2026), plus a HIPAA Contact Form.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://boonecohealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Release_of_Health_Information_Form_August_2017.pdf
- **Format:** PDF (native, 1 page)
- **Description:** Older version of the "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, dated August 2017. Includes patient info, release FROM/TO fields, dates of service, purpose checkboxes, specific record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization (substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS), and delivery format options (Paper, Fax, CD, USB). Has text layer. This was the original PDF linked from the site but has since been superseded by a .docx version.

### form-2.pdf (converted from form-2.docx)
- **Source URL:** https://boonecohealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Auth-for-Release-of-PHI.docx
- **Original format:** Microsoft Word .docx (converted to PDF via LibreOffice)
- **Description:** Current version of the "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form, uploaded February 2026. Updated address (1173 South 8th Street), includes email address (Roi@boonecohealth.org), adds encrypted email as a delivery option, has 12-month fixed expiration (vs. blank months in the older version), and uses "Protected Health Information" in the title. This is the version currently linked from the Patient Forms section of the website.

### form-3.pdf (converted from form-3.docx)
- **Source URL:** https://boonecohealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HIPAA-contact-form.docx
- **Original format:** Microsoft Word .docx (converted to PDF via LibreOffice)
- **Description:** "HIPAA Contact Information" form — NOT an ROI form. This form allows patients to designate individuals authorized to receive their medical and/or billing information. It includes a table for listing authorized contacts with their relationships and phone numbers. The form itself states: "This is not a substitute for a Release of Information form to obtain medical records."

## Difficulties
- The current ROI form is published as a .docx file, not a PDF — this is unusual and less accessible for patients who may not have Microsoft Word.
- The older PDF version is still accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the website's Patient Forms page.
- The website's General Information page required JavaScript rendering to see the links (static curl returned no form links).

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The form was findable through basic web search and was prominently listed on the Patient Forms section of their website (Patient Resources > General Information > Patient Forms).

# Desert Valley Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: Desert Valley Hospital
- **Website**: https://dvmc.com
- **Location**: Victorville, CA 92395
- **Parent System**: Prime Healthcare (for-profit)
- **Associated Medical Group**: Desert Valley Medical Group (desertvalleymedicalgroup.com)

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for DVH-specific ROI form**: Searched for `"Desert Valley Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` and similar queries. No DVH-specific downloadable form was found.

2. **Navigated dvmc.com website**: Visited the Medical Records page at https://dvmc.com/patients-visitors/medical-records/. The page describes the ROI process (mail/fax/in-person submission, $15 fee, 14 business day turnaround) but does **not** provide a downloadable authorization form. The only PDFs on dvmc.com are Privacy Policy documents and a mosquito bite prevention flyer.

3. **Checked dvmc.com sitemap**: Crawled `page-sitemap.xml` — confirmed no form download pages exist on the site.

4. **Probed common URL patterns**: Tried multiple guessed URLs for authorization PDFs on dvmc.com (e.g., `/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DVH-Authorization-for-Use-or-Disclosure-of-Health-Information.pdf`). All returned 404.

5. **Checked Desert Valley Medical Group site** (desertvalleymedicalgroup.com): No patient ROI form. Found only an employment services authorization form.

6. **Searched Prime Healthcare parent system**: Checked `ehp.primehealthcare.com` — found a form but it is marked "FOR PRIME EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ENROLLED DEPENDENTS USE ONLY" (form PHSI-320-012).

7. **Checked sister Prime Healthcare hospitals**: Found the standard Prime Healthcare patient ROI form template (PHSI-280-014) on:
   - Chino Valley Medical Center (cvmc.com) — downloaded successfully
   - Centinela Hospital Medical Center (centinelamed.com) — verified same template
   - These forms are identical in structure, differing only in the hospital name/address header and form code suffix.

## What Worked
The form was not available directly from Desert Valley Hospital. The best result came from checking sister hospitals within the Prime Healthcare system, which use an identical standardized form template (PHSI-280-014). Desert Valley Hospital would use the same form with "DVH" designation.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://ehp.primehealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Authorization-for-Use-or-Disclosure-of-Health-Information.pdf
- **What it is**: Prime Healthcare Employee Health Plan authorization for use/disclosure of health information. Marked "FOR PRIME EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ENROLLED DEPENDENTS USE ONLY." Form number PHSI-320-012. 2 pages.
- **Relevance**: This is the employee version, not the general patient ROI form. Downloaded because it appeared in search results as a Prime Healthcare authorization form before the employee-only restriction was apparent.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.cvmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CVMC-Authorization-for-Use-or-Disclosure-of-Health-Information.pdf
- **What it is**: Patient-facing "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" from Chino Valley Medical Center — a sister Prime Healthcare hospital. Form number PHSI-280-014 CVMC (04/20). 2 pages. Includes checkboxes for record types, purpose, electronic format options (CD or paper), expiration, and patient rights. This is the same standardized template Desert Valley Hospital would use (with DVH header/address instead).
- **Relevance**: This is the closest available patient ROI form for Desert Valley Hospital. The template is system-wide across Prime Healthcare facilities.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://desertvalleymedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Authorization-for-Employment-services-8.pdf
- **What it is**: Authorization for Employment Services form from Desert Valley Medical Group. 1 page. For occupational health services (DOT physicals, drug screens, etc.) — not an ROI/medical records release form.
- **Relevance**: Not an ROI form. This was the only downloadable authorization-type form found on the Desert Valley Medical Group website.

## Difficulties Encountered
- **No downloadable ROI form on dvmc.com**: Desert Valley Hospital's medical records page instructs patients to contact the department by phone, fax, or in person to obtain the authorization form, but does not provide it for download.
- **No form on DVMG site either**: The associated medical group site also lacks a patient ROI form.
- **Had to rely on sister hospital**: The actual patient form was only findable on other Prime Healthcare hospital websites (CVMC, Centinela). Desert Valley Hospital uses the same system-wide template but hasn't posted their version online.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard
The form is not available from Desert Valley Hospital's website at all. Finding the correct template required knowing the parent system (Prime Healthcare) and checking sister hospitals.

# Southeast Medical Group — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Southeast Medical Group (SEMG)
- **Website:** https://mysemg.com
- **Location:** Alpharetta, GA
- **Type:** Independent physician practice, for-profit

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web search for authorization/release forms (filetype:pdf)
- Searched: `"Southeast Medical Group" Alpharetta GA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`
- Searched: `site:mysemg.com medical records release authorization form`
- Searched: `"Southeast Medical Group" OR "mysemg" authorization "release of information" filetype:pdf`
- **Result:** No SEMG-specific ROI PDF found. Searches confirmed SEMG does not publish a standalone ROI form on their own website.

### 2. Navigated SEMG website
- Checked https://mysemg.com/resources/forms — lists 10 patient forms (registration, advance directive, health questionnaire, etc.) but **no ROI/authorization for release of records form**.
- Checked https://mysemg.com/resources — "Medical Records" section says patients can request records online or in person, with a "Request Records" link.
- Expanded FAQ "How can I get a copy of my medical record?" — Answer: "The fastest method is clicking here" (link to MediCopy) and email medicalrecords@southeastmedicalgroup.com.

### 3. Followed "Request Records" link
- https://semg.link/med-records redirects to https://www.medicopy.net/patients — **MediCopy**, a third-party Release of Information service.
- MediCopy's ROI page (https://www.medicopy.net/roi) provides authorization forms in PDF and online (HelloSign) formats.
- **This is the form SEMG patients are directed to use for medical records requests.**

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.medicopy.net/sites/default/files/2023-12/MediCopy%20MRO%20Authorization%20%28English%29.pdf
- **What it is:** MediCopy Authorization for the Release of Medical Records (2023 version)
- **Description:** Generic MediCopy ROI authorization form. Includes fields for facility name, patient info, recipient info, record types to release, date range, delivery method, and signature. Not SEMG-specific but is the form SEMG patients are directed to use.
- **File size:** ~1.4 MB
- **Has text layer:** Yes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://medicopy.net/sites/default/files/2020-05/MediCopy%20Authorization%202020.pdf
- **What it is:** MediCopy Authorization for the Release of Medical Records (2020 version)
- **Description:** Older version of the same MediCopy authorization form, still linked on the MediCopy ROI page. Very similar content to form-1.pdf.
- **File size:** ~1.2 MB
- **Has text layer:** Yes

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4pare3i8/production/bd23ef224680293eaafa04ca5303569d6d4952d2.pdf
- **What it is:** SEMG Patient Portal Proxy Authentication Form
- **Description:** A form allowing authorized individuals to access a patient's portal at SEMG. Image-only scan (no extractable text). Related to records access but not an ROI form.
- **File size:** ~198 KB
- **Has text layer:** No (image-only)

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4pare3i8/production/3f40d79aa87a96396ffad4b157f7dcfbea285511.pdf
- **What it is:** SEMG Patient Registration Form (English)
- **Description:** Multi-page patient registration form that includes a "Privacy Practices Acknowledgement and HIPAA Authorization Form" section and a blanket consent to release medical records to specialists associated with the patient's care plan. Not a standalone ROI form, but contains HIPAA-related language and a general consent to release records for treatment purposes.
- **File size:** ~multi-page
- **Has text layer:** Yes

## Key Findings

1. **SEMG does not publish their own standalone ROI/Authorization for Release of Medical Records form.** They outsource release of information to MediCopy, a third-party HIM service.
2. The patient journey for requesting records is: mysemg.com → Resources → Medical Records → "Request Records" → redirected to medicopy.net → fill out MediCopy's generic authorization form.
3. MediCopy offers both an online (HelloSign) authorization form and downloadable PDF versions.
4. The registration form includes HIPAA acknowledgement and general consent to release records for treatment, but this is not a patient-initiated ROI form.

## Difficulties
- No difficulties with downloading. All PDFs were accessible without bot blocking.
- The main challenge was that SEMG doesn't have their own ROI form — it required following the redirect chain to MediCopy to find the actual authorization form patients would use.

# Anaheim Global Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Anaheim Global Medical Center (AGMC)
- **Website**: https://www.anaheimglobalmedicalcenter.com/
- **Location**: 1025 South Anaheim Blvd, Anaheim, CA 92805
- **Parent System**: KPC Health (formerly known as Western Medical Center - Anaheim)
- **Phone**: (714) 533-6220

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI/authorization form PDFs**: Searched for `"Anaheim Global Medical Center" authorization release health information form PDF` and similar queries. Results initially pointed to AHMC Healthcare (Anaheim Regional Medical Center) forms, which is a **different hospital/system** — not AGMC.

2. **Clarified parent system**: Anaheim Global Medical Center is part of **KPC Health**, not AHMC Healthcare. Searched specifically for KPC Health authorization forms — no downloadable PDF forms found for any KPC Health facility.

3. **Website navigation**: Browsed the AGMC website including:
   - Homepage
   - Patient & Family Resources page
   - Notice of Privacy Practices page
   - Billing & Payments page
   - Contact Us page
   - About page
   - Services page
   No ROI/authorization form PDF was found on any page.

4. **Comprehensive PDF scan**: Scraped all PDF links across all major pages of the website. Found only:
   - Notice of Privacy Practices (English/Spanish)
   - Service Modification Notice
   - Financial Assistance / Charity Care / Debt Collection policies
   - Self-Screening Poster
   - Allocation Guidelines
   - Health Equity document
   No ROI/authorization form among any of them.

5. **ChartRequest portal**: The hospital's "Access Medical Records" link on the Patient & Family Resources page directs to **https://app.chartrequest.com/m/KPC-locations**, a third-party web portal. The portal requires account creation (LOGIN/SIGN UP) to submit a medical records request. Anaheim Global Medical Center is listed as a location in the dropdown. No downloadable PDF authorization form is provided through this portal.

6. **Searched sister KPC Health hospitals**: Checked Orange County Global Medical Center, Chapman Global Medical Center, South Coast Global Medical Center — none have downloadable ROI forms either. All KPC Health facilities appear to use ChartRequest.

## What Was Found

### No ROI/Authorization Form Available as Downloadable PDF

Anaheim Global Medical Center does **not** publish a downloadable ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form on their website. Instead, they direct patients to a third-party web portal (ChartRequest by KPC Healthcare, Inc.) which requires account creation to submit medical records requests online.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.anaheimglobalmedicalcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AGMC-NPP-2016-English.pdf
- **Document type**: Notice of Privacy Practices (NOT an ROI form)
- **Description**: 8-page AGMC Notice of Privacy Practices effective January 31, 2016. Describes how medical information may be used and disclosed. While not an ROI form, it is the closest patient-facing privacy document available on the website and describes patients' rights regarding access to their medical information.
- **File size**: 303,793 bytes
- **Has text layer**: Yes (23,205 characters extracted)

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **Confusion with similarly-named hospital**: Initial searches returned forms for AHMC Anaheim Regional Medical Center, which is a completely different hospital system. Care was needed to distinguish between AHMC Healthcare and KPC Health.

2. **No downloadable form available**: The hospital relies entirely on the ChartRequest third-party portal for medical records requests. No PDF authorization form is published on their website.

3. **ChartRequest requires account creation**: The ChartRequest portal (https://app.chartrequest.com/m/KPC-locations) requires users to create an account before they can submit a medical records request, making it impossible to evaluate the authorization form without registering.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard

The ROI form is effectively not available as a downloadable document. Patients must use the ChartRequest web portal with account creation, which represents a barrier to accessing the authorization process.

## Organization
- **Name:** Heartland Community Health Center
- **Website:** https://heartlandhealth.org
- **Location:** Lawrence, KS
- **Type:** FQHC, independent, nonprofit, Midwest

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF with authorization/release keywords** — Did not return direct results.
2. **Web search for medical records release form** — Did not return direct results.
3. **Web search scoped to site:heartlandhealth.org** — Successfully identified the form URL directly from the site's WordPress uploads directory.

The third search strategy was the one that worked, returning the direct PDF link hosted on their WordPress site.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://heartlandhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FINAL-Updated-Release-of-Information-Form-2021.pdf
- **File size:** 237,164 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Has text layer:** Yes
- **Initial impression:** This is the official "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" form for Heartland Community Health Center. It is a single-page form with fields for patient name, DOB, address, date range, record types (medical, dental, immunization, x-ray, pathology/lab, mental health), delivery method (pick up, email, fax, mail), records from/to sections, and purpose of request. It includes HIPAA language, re-disclosure warnings, and signature lines. The form mentions their HIM department contact (785-842-4477 Option 5) and provides return instructions (email, fax, or mail).

## Difficulties
- None. The form was readily available as a direct PDF download on their website. The search was straightforward.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `MUSC Health "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — immediately found the direct PDF URL on muschealth.org.
2. **Web search for medical records release**: Searched `MUSC Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found the main authorization form, a MyChart instruction PDF, and a Spanish version.
3. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:muschealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records page at `muschealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`.
4. **Medical records page review**: Visited the MUSC medical records page, which offers multiple pathways: MyChart portal, eRequest (Ciox/Swellbox online tool), and manual PDF form submission.
5. **Spanish form search**: Searched for Spanish version and found it linked from the same domain.

## What Worked

The direct web search was highly effective. MUSC Health publishes their authorization form at a clean, predictable URL under their main domain. The form was easy to find — no bot blocking, no login walls, no JavaScript-rendered pages.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf
- **File size**: 158,878 bytes
- **Description**: The primary "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (English). This is the main ROI form. It includes fields for patient information, records source/destination, types of records, purpose of release, date range, release method (Mail, MyChart, Fax, Encrypted E-mail), and signature/authorization sections. It covers sensitive records (mental health, HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder under 42 CFR Part 2). Multi-purpose form usable for both patient access and third-party release.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://mychart.muschealth.com/mychart/en-us/docs/Med%20Rec%20Request.pdf
- **File size**: 524,775 bytes (5 pages)
- **Description**: Instructional document about how to request medical records via MyChart patient portal. Not an authorization form itself — it's a step-by-step guide with screenshots explaining how patients can use MyChart to request records electronically. Notes that fees apply and some older records may only be available via US Mail.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/spanish-auth-to-release-phi.pdf
- **File size**: 169,216 bytes
- **Description**: Spanish-language version of the Authorization to Release Protected Health Information form ("Autorización para Divulgar Información de Salud Protegida"). Same structure and content as form-1.pdf but in Spanish with bilingual headers.

## Difficulties Encountered

- None significant. MUSC Health makes their forms readily available at stable URLs with no access barriers.
- The organization also offers an online eRequest tool (via Ciox/Swellbox) as an alternative to the PDF form, but that requires identity verification via webcam/smartphone photo of driver's license.

## Additional Notes

- MUSC Health provides three pathways for medical records requests: (1) MyChart portal, (2) Ciox eRequest online tool, and (3) manual PDF authorization form.
- The PDF form supports multiple delivery methods including encrypted email and MyChart.

# Intermountain Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Intermountain Medical Center
- **Location**: Murray, UT
- **Parent System**: Intermountain Health (formerly Intermountain Healthcare)
- **Website**: https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/intermountain-medical-center

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Intermountain Medical Center authorization release health information filetype:pdf"** — Found references to Intermountain Health's authorization forms and their Notice of Privacy Practices.
2. **Web search for "Intermountain Healthcare medical records release form authorization PDF"** — Found direct download links to two forms on intermountainhealthcare.org.
3. **Web search for "site:intermountainhealthcare.org authorization release medical records"** — Found the medical records request pages for Utah/Idaho and other states, plus links to three distinct forms.

All forms were found through the parent system (Intermountain Health) website. Intermountain Medical Center does not have its own separate ROI form — it uses system-wide forms. The forms were directly downloadable as PDFs without any login or portal requirement.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://intermountainhealthcare.org/-/media/files/patient-tools/authorization-for-release-of-health-info-form.pdf
- **File size**: 100,038 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — A general-purpose ROI form for releasing PHI to a third party. Includes fields for patient info, recipient, delivery method, facility/provider releasing the info, type of information, purpose, and authorization terms. Dated 5/2017 (IHC CMP870). References HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524. Appears to be the older/legacy form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://intermountainhealthcare.org/-/media/files/intermountain-health/for-patients/medical-records/auth-to-use-and-disclose-phi-request-records-be-sent-to-someone-else.ashx
- **File size**: 84,424 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — A newer fillable form specifically for requesting records be sent to someone else (third-party release). Includes interactive form fields (Print/Clear buttons visible). Dated 06/2025. Branded as Intermountain Health (post-rebrand). Has checkboxes for purpose (Continuity of Care, Insurance/WC, Legal, Personal, etc.) and record types.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://prod.intermountainhealth.org/-/media/files/intermountain-health/for-patients/medical-records/request-records-for-yourself.ashx
- **File size**: 93,025 bytes
- **Description**: "Patient Request for Health Information" — A fillable form specifically for patients requesting their own records (patient access form, not third-party release). Dated 06/2025. Includes checkboxes for record types (Clinic Visit, History & Physical, Laboratory, Imaging, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, Billing, Substance Use, etc.) and delivery format options. References HIPAA right of access. This is the most patient-centered of the three forms.

## Difficulties Encountered
- **None significant**. Forms were easy to find via web search and directly downloadable. No bot blocking, no login walls, no JavaScript-rendered pages.
- The organization uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones, which is typical for large health systems.
- There are two distinct domains: `intermountainhealthcare.org` (legacy) and `prod.intermountainhealth.org` (current), both hosting forms.

## Summary
Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) uses Intermountain Health's system-wide ROI forms. Three forms were found and downloaded: one legacy general authorization form, one newer third-party disclosure form, and one patient self-request form. All are real PDFs with text layers and appear to have fillable fields (forms 2 and 3 are clearly fillable with Print/Clear buttons). Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

# Massachusetts General Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search**: Searched for "Massachusetts General Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" and "Massachusetts General Hospital medical records release form PDF download". Both immediately returned direct links to the PDF forms.
2. **Parent system check**: MGH is part of Mass General Brigham (formerly Partners HealthCare). The current form is hosted on the Mass General Brigham website (massgeneralbrigham.org) with MGH-specific branding and contact info. A search on the parent system site confirmed the same forms.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/content/dam/mgb-global/en/patient-care/patient-and-visitor-information/medical-records/documents/mgh/medical-records-release-mgh-english.pdf
- **File size**: 569,504 bytes
- **Document**: "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" — MGH-specific ROI form, 2 pages
- **Version**: MGB00087 (06/24) — appears to be the current version (June 2024)
- **Impression**: Current, official MGH ROI/authorization form hosted on the Mass General Brigham parent system website. Includes sections for patient info, permission to share, record types, sensitive information consent (HIV, genetics, substance use, mental health), and terms. Offers electronic delivery options (Patient Gateway, secure email, fax, paper mail).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.massgeneral.org/assets/mgh/pdf/imaging/forms/medical-records-release-mgh-english.pdf
- **File size**: 104,262 bytes
- **Document**: "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" — same title, appears to be an older or alternate version hosted under the imaging section of massgeneral.org
- **Impression**: Similar content to form-1 but smaller file size and slightly different formatting. Likely an older version of the same form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.massgeneral.org/assets/mgh/pdf/notices/roiauthorizationform-1-17.pdf
- **File size**: 600,806 bytes
- **Document**: "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" — older version from the notices section
- **Impression**: Older version of the MGH ROI form (filename suggests January 2017 vintage). Still uses "Mass General Brigham" references but layout differs from the current version.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **None significant**. The form was easy to find via web search. Multiple versions exist at different URLs, all accessible without any bot blocking or login requirements.
- The current authoritative version (form-1.pdf) is hosted on the Mass General Brigham parent system domain rather than massgeneral.org directly, which is consistent with the system consolidation.

## Summary

MGH's ROI form is readily available online with no barriers. The current version (form-1.pdf, MGB00087 06/24) is a well-structured 2-page form offering multiple delivery methods including electronic options. Three versions were found at different URLs representing the form's evolution over time.

# UF Health Shands Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** UF Health Shands Hospital
- **Website:** https://ufhealth.org
- **Location:** Gainesville, FL
- **Type:** Teaching hospital, major system, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"UF Health Shands Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — returned general pointers to ufhealth.org but no direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for `"UF Health Shands Hospital" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found multiple direct PDF URLs including forms hosted at ufhealth.org.
3. **Web search** for `site:ufhealth.org authorization release medical records form` — confirmed the primary form URL and found additional variants.
4. **Fetched the medical records page** at https://ufhealth.org/medical-records — this is the canonical patient-facing page. It links directly to the primary form (form-2.pdf) and describes submission methods (mail, fax, in-person pickup).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://ufhealth.org/sites/default/files/media/Locations/forms/Medical-Record-Release-Form.pdf
- **File size:** 612,570 bytes
- **Description:** Comprehensive "Record Request: Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information (PHI) Maintained by UF Health" form. Multi-section layout with identity verification fields (driver license, personally known, etc.), representative authorization section, and facility selection checkboxes for UF Health Shands Hospital and Shands Rehab Hospital. Appears to be a more detailed/newer version of the ROI form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://ufhealth.org/assets/media/forms/46283_F.pdf
- **File size:** 94,652 bytes
- **Description:** "Record Request: Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information (PHI) Maintained by UF Health." This is the **primary form linked from the official medical records page** (ufhealth.org/medical-records). Simpler layout than form-1; includes from/to fields, facility checkboxes, and instructions to mail or fax completed forms to UF Health HIM Dept – ROI.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://ufhealth.org/sites/default/files/media/PDF/ROI.pdf
- **File size:** 88,083 bytes

Lists more specific facility checkboxes (Shands Hospital, Rehab Hospital, Psychiatric Hospital, HomeCare, Radiology, UF clinics).

- **File size:** 181,454 bytes
- **Description:** "Record Request: Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information (PHI) Maintained by UF Health." A specialized variant with pre-filled provider information for "All our Providers & UF C.A.R.D" (Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment). Same general structure as form-2 but tailored to a specific clinic/program.

## Difficulties Encountered
- **None significant.** The forms were straightforward to find via web search. The medical records page (ufhealth.org/medical-records) is well-organized and clearly links to the primary form.
- Multiple versions of the form exist at different URLs on the same site, likely reflecting different revisions or location-specific variants.
- All PDFs downloaded successfully with curl (no bot blocking or JavaScript requirements).
- All forms have text layers (not image-only scans).

## Summary
UF Health Shands makes its ROI forms readily available online. The primary form (form-2.pdf) is linked directly from the medical records page. Multiple versions exist on the site — an older/more detailed version (form-3.pdf), a comprehensive version with identity verification (form-1.pdf), and a clinic-specific variant (form-4.pdf). Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

# Piedmont Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Piedmont Medical Center
- **Location:** Rock Hill, SC
- **Website:** https://www.piedmontmedicalcenter.com
- **System Affiliation:** Tenet Healthcare (for-profit)
- **Type:** Community hospital

## Search Strategies

### What worked
- **Web search** for "Piedmont Medical Center Rock Hill SC authorization release health information form PDF" immediately returned direct PDF links and the medical records request page URL.
- The organization has a clear **"Request Medical Records"** page at https://www.piedmontmedicalcenter.com/patients/request-medical-records with a direct link to the authorization form.
- A second form was found on the **Piedmont Physician Network** website (affiliated physician practices).

### Difficulties
- **Cloudflare bot protection** blocked direct `curl` downloads — both PDFs returned HTML challenge pages instead of actual PDFs.
- Used **Chrome DevTools browser** to navigate to the pages, which passed the Cloudflare challenge, then extracted the PDFs via JavaScript `fetch()` from within the browser context.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.piedmontmedicalcenter.com/docs/librariesproviderpiedmont/pdfs/authorization-to-use-and-disclose-protected-health-information-form.pdf?sfvrsn=8ea4433c_0
- **File size:** 167,018 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Document type:** ROI / Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information
- **Description:** Hospital-specific authorization form for Piedmont Medical Center. Single page, has text layer, includes checkboxes for record types (discharge summary, H&P, lab results, consultations, ER report, operative report, pathology report). Includes fields for patient info, information requested, and recipient designation. Form revision date R03/2013.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.piedmontphysiciannetwork.com/docs/pmcphysiciannetworklibraries/default-document-library/auth-disclose-medical-record.pdf?sfvrsn=df6c4f7b_2
- **File size:** 380,157 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Document type:** Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information (Physician Network version)
- **Description:** A more detailed 2-page authorization form used by the PMC Physician Network. Includes sections for highly confidential information (mental health, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, psychotherapy notes), purpose of disclosure, expiration, and revocation rights. More comprehensive than form-1 with specific HIPAA-related language.

## Summary
- **Retrieval difficulty:** Easy (form linked directly from medical records page; minor technical hurdle with Cloudflare)
- The hospital has two related forms — one for the hospital itself (form-1) and one for its physician network (form-2). The physician network form is more detailed and HIPAA-compliant in its language.
- The medical records page also mentions Datavant as the contracted vendor for handling release of medical information, and provides online portals (Swellbox) for both patient and provider record requests.

# Abbeville Area Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Abbeville Area Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not directly return the form in top results.
2. **Web search** for `"Abbeville Area Medical Center" "medical records" "release form" South Carolina` — found the medical records page URL and a direct link to the PDF.
3. **Web search** for `site:abbevilleareamc.com authorization release medical records` — returned a direct URL to the 2019 version of the PDF form.
4. **Website navigation** — fetched the Medical Records page at `https://www.abbevilleareamc.com/abbeville-area-medical-center/patients-visitors/medical-records/` and extracted all PDF links from the HTML.

**What worked best**: The site-specific web search (strategy 3) returned a direct PDF URL. Scraping the medical records page HTML (strategy 4) revealed both a newer version of the authorization form (uploaded Jan 2023) and a HIPAA privacy brochure.

## Downloaded Documents

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.abbevilleareamc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HIM-1022-authorization.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Release Protected Health Information (ROI form)

Includes patient name/DOB fields, recipient fields, checkboxes for record types (H&P, discharge summary, operative reports, labs, radiology, etc.), date of service fields, purpose field, and signature lines. Contains sensitive-info release language (psych, substance abuse, HIV). States authorization valid for 90 days. Form number HIM 1022. This is the current version linked from the medical records page (uploaded 2023-01, replacing a 2019 version).
- **File size**: 230,134 bytes

- **Has text layer**: Yes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: http://www.abbevilleareamc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HIPAA-Brochure-AAMC-Rev-07-2017-legal.pdf
- **Document type**: HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (brochure)
- **Description**: Two-page PDF titled "SUMMARY OF YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS". This is a HIPAA privacy practices brochure, not an ROI form. It describes how AAMC uses and discloses protected health information, patient rights, and how to file complaints. Revised July 2017.
- **File size**: 666,717 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Has text layer**: Yes

## Difficulties Encountered

- **None significant**. The form was easy to find — it is directly linked from the Medical Records page, which is accessible via Patients & Visitors navigation. The website is a straightforward WordPress site with no bot blocking or login requirements.
- An older version of the same form (from 2019) was found via web search; the current website links to a 2023-uploaded version with minor updates (added purpose field, updated revocation language).

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy

The form was findable within 2-3 clicks from the homepage (Home → Patients & Visitors → Medical Records) and was directly downloadable as a PDF.

# Franklin Primary Health Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Franklin Primary Health Center
- **Location:** Mobile, AL
- **Type:** FQHC, independent, nonprofit
- **Website:** https://franklinprimary.org/
- **Patient Portal:** EPIC/MyChart via OCHIN (https://mychart.ochin.org/MyChartFPHC/Authentication/Login)

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI form (multiple queries):**
   - `"Franklin Primary Health Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No results
   - `"Franklin Primary Health Center" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — No results
   - `site:franklinprimary.org authorization release medical records` — No results
   - `franklinprimary.org "release of information" OR "authorization" OR "medical records request" filetype:pdf` — Only found Notice of Privacy Practices
   - `"Franklin Primary Health Center" HIPAA authorization form consent release records` — No results

2. **Website navigation:**
   - Visited homepage, Patient Information page, Patient Rights & Responsibilities page
   - Examined "For Patients" menu — no medical records or ROI-specific page found
   - Checked all PDF links across all major pages (homepage, patient-information, health-care-services, patient-rights-responsibilities, new-patient-packet, school-based-health-center)

3. **Sitemap analysis:**
   - Retrieved and examined full WordPress sitemap — no medical records or release-of-information pages exist

4. **URL guessing:**
   - Tried 14 common ROI form filename patterns across 8 upload date directories — no matches found

5. **Wayback Machine:**
   - Checked complete archive of all PDFs ever hosted at `franklinprimary.org/wp-content/uploads/` — no ROI form has ever been published on this site

## Result

**No dedicated ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form was found online.** Franklin Primary Health Center does not appear to publish a standalone ROI form on their website. The New Patient Packet contains a brief "Assignment and Release" clause authorizing release of information for insurance/billing purposes only, but this is not a general medical records release form.

## Downloaded Documents

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://franklinprimary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/New-Patient-Packet.pdf
- **Document type:** New Patient Registration Packet (multi-page)
- **Contents:** Patient information form, sliding fee scale self-declaration, privacy notice acknowledgement, patient questionnaire, patient satisfaction survey, patient bill of rights and responsibilities
- **ROI relevance:** Contains a brief "Assignment and Release" clause authorizing FPHC to "release all information necessary to secure payment of benefits" — limited to insurance billing, not a general ROI form

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://franklinprimary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf
- **Document type:** Notice of Privacy Practices (HIPAA NPP)
- **Contents:** Standard HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices describing patient rights to access medical records, how health information is used/shared, and how to file complaints
- **ROI relevance:** Describes patients' right to "get a copy of your paper or electronic medical record" but does not include an actual authorization form

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://franklinprimary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FPHC-Patient-Bill-of-Rights-and-Responsibilities.pdf
- **Document type:** Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities
- **Contents:** Lists patient rights (including right to authorize release of health information and to review/copy medical records) and patient responsibilities
- **ROI relevance:** References the right to authorize release but does not include an actual form

## Difficulties Encountered
- No dedicated ROI form exists on the website — the organization does not make one available for download
- The "For Patients" navigation menu could not be clicked/hovered in the browser (likely a JavaScript-dependent dropdown), but the full sitemap was examined instead
- The HMIS Privacy Notice PDF (Appendix_I_HMISPrivacyNotice.pdf) returned HTML instead of a valid PDF — appears to be a broken/removed link
- Patients would need to contact the center directly at (251) 432-4117 or visit in person to obtain an ROI form, or potentially use the EPIC/MyChart patient portal

# HopeHealth (Florence, SC) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** HopeHealth, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.hope-health.org/
- **Location:** Florence, SC (360 North Irby St, Florence, SC 29501)
- **Type:** FQHC (Federally Qualified Health Center), independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web searches** for `"HopeHealth" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no HopeHealth-specific PDF form found.
2. **Web searches** for `"HopeHealth" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — results pointed to a JotForm (see below) and generic HIPAA forms, but no HopeHealth-branded PDF.
3. **Site-specific search** (`site:hope-health.org authorization release medical records`) — found the Medical Records page at https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/, which directs patients to HealthMark Group's online portal.
4. **Website navigation** — browsed Patient Resources, Become a Patient, Health Professionals, and Medical Records pages. No downloadable ROI/authorization form PDF found anywhere on the site.
5. **HTML source inspection** — scraped the medical records page and homepage for links containing "release", "authorization", "roi", "form", or "pdf". Found only the Notice of Privacy Practices, Patient Handbook, and HealthMark portal link.
6. **Wayback Machine** — checked archived versions from 2020–2024. The medical records page has consistently directed patients to HealthMark Group throughout this period; no earlier version with a downloadable form was found.
7. **JotForm investigation** — a JotForm at https://form.jotform.com/222895392471061 appeared in search results claiming to be for HopeHealth. However, the JotForm account name is "hopeclinicellisco" (Hope Clinic Ellis County), and the form is NOT linked from anywhere on hope-health.org. This form belongs to Hope Health Ellis County, TX (hopehealthtx.org), a completely different organization.
8. **HealthMark Group portal** — checked https://medrelease.healthmark-group.com/ (login-only for clients/employees) and https://requestmanager.healthmark-group.com/register (requires email verification to proceed). No downloadable form accessible without completing the full request flow.
9. **HealthMark generic form** — found a generic HealthMark Medical Records Release Authorization form at https://www.hmutx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HealthMark-Medical-Record-Release-Auth.pdf. Downloaded as form-2.pdf.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.hope-health.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices_26.pdf
- **Document type:** Notice of Privacy Practices (NOT an ROI form)
- **Description:** HopeHealth's HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, effective September 23, 2013, amended February 16, 2026. Describes how medical information may be used and disclosed. This is a privacy notice document, not an authorization/release form.
- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 237,690 bytes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.hmutx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HealthMark-Medical-Record-Release-Auth.pdf
- **Document type:** Generic HealthMark Group Medical Records Release Authorization form (NOT HopeHealth-specific)
- **Description:** A generic authorization form from HealthMark Group (HopeHealth's medical records partner). This is NOT branded to HopeHealth and is not linked from the HopeHealth website. It is a general-purpose authorization form that HealthMark provides for any of their client facilities. Includes fields for recipient, patient info, dates of service, records to release, purpose, and HIPAA acknowledgments. Expires 180 days from signature.
- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 49,115 bytes

## Key Findings

1. **No HopeHealth-specific ROI/authorization form PDF exists online.** The organization does not publish a downloadable authorization form on their website.
2. **HopeHealth uses HealthMark Group** as their third-party medical records release partner. All medical records requests are directed through HealthMark's online Request Manager portal (https://requestmanager.healthmark-group.com/register).
3. **The request process is entirely online** — patients enter their email, receive a secure link, and complete the request digitally through HealthMark's system.
4. **The JotForm result was a false lead** — it belongs to a different organization (Hope Health Ellis County, TX) and is not associated with HopeHealth Florence, SC.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **No downloadable form:** HopeHealth has fully outsourced their medical records release process to HealthMark Group. There is no standalone PDF form that patients can download, print, and submit.
- **Confusing search results:** Multiple web search results conflated HopeHealth Florence SC (hope-health.org) with Hope Health Ellis County TX (hopehealthtx.org), leading to false positives for the JotForm.
- **HealthMark portal behind authentication:** The HealthMark Request Manager requires email verification to proceed, making it impossible to access the actual authorization workflow or any forms within it.
- **Consistent across all archive snapshots:** The Wayback Machine showed that HopeHealth has been using the HealthMark portal approach since at least 2020, so there doesn't appear to have been a recent transition from downloadable forms.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard

No HopeHealth-branded ROI form PDF is publicly available for download. The organization has fully delegated medical records requests to a third-party portal (HealthMark Group), which requires email verification to initiate.

# Phelps Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Phelps Hospital
- **Location:** Sleepy Hollow, NY
- **Website:** https://phelps.northwell.edu/
- **Parent System:** Northwell Health (https://www.northwell.edu/)

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for "Phelps Hospital Northwell Health authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately identified that Phelps Hospital uses the Northwell Health system-wide forms available at https://www.northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records.
2. **Web search** for "Phelps Hospital Sleepy Hollow NY medical records release form" — confirmed the same Northwell Health forms page and provided direct PDF URLs.
3. **Web search** for "site:northwell.edu authorization release medical records form" — found additional form URLs.
4. **Navigated the Northwell Health medical records page** via browser to confirm all available forms and get exact download URLs.

## What Worked
The Northwell Health medical records page (https://www.northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records) is well-organized and clearly lists all forms. Phelps Hospital, as part of the Northwell system, uses the system-wide forms. The page has two distinct sections:
- **Request for Access to Health Information** — specifically for patients requesting their own records (cites HIPAA 45 CFR 164.524)
- **Authorization for Release of Health Information** — general third-party release authorization

## Difficulties
- One initial download attempt for the Spanish authorization form returned HTML instead of PDF (the URL `authorization-for-release-health-information-form-spanish.pdf` redirected to an HTML page). Browser inspection revealed that both the "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)" links on the website point to the same URL (`request-for-access-to-health-info-form-spanish.pdf`), which appears to be a website bug.
- Two different URLs (`authorization-for-release-health-information-form-english.pdf` and `release-of-health-information-form-english.pdf`) both contain the same Authorization for Release form content, though the files differ at the binary level (different PDF metadata/creation tools possibly).

## Downloaded Files

|------|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| form-1.pdf | https://www.northwell.edu/sites/northwell.edu/files/2022-03/authorization-for-release-health-information-form-english.pdf | 3 | 86 KB | **Authorization for Release of Health Information (English)** — General third-party release authorization form. Covers release of health information from one entity to another. Includes checkboxes for delivery manner (mail, pick up, electronic), format (paper, USB, CD), and specific information types. |

Note: On the website, this same URL is linked under both "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)". |
| form-6.pdf | https://www.northwell.edu/sites/northwell.edu/files/2022-03/request-for-access-to-health-form-instructions.pdf | 2 | 435 KB | **Instructions for Completing the Request for Access to Health Information Form** — Step-by-step guide with annotated examples for filling out the patient access request form. |

## Key Observations
- Northwell Health distinguishes between **patient self-access** (Request for Access) and **third-party release** (Authorization for Release), which is a good practice.
- The patient access form (form-2.pdf) explicitly cites HIPAA 45 CFR 164.524 (Right of Access).
- All forms are system-wide Northwell Health forms, not Phelps Hospital–specific.
- Forms are easily findable — directly linked from the main medical records page with clear section headings.
- The Spanish form situation appears to have a bug on the website (both Spanish links point to the same authorization form, with no separate Spanish patient access form available).
