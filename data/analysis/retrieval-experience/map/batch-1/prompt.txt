# Arizona Community Physicians — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `"Arizona Community Physicians" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — didn't return direct links but confirmed forms exist.
2. **Web search for medical records release**: Searched `"Arizona Community Physicians" "medical records" "release form" Tucson` — returned direct URLs to multiple forms on azacp.com.
3. **Site-specific search**: `site:azacp.com authorization release medical records` — returned detailed results with multiple form URLs and descriptions.
4. **Direct website navigation**: Visited https://www.azacp.com/forms/ to confirm all available forms and get correct URLs.

**What worked best**: The second and third web searches returned direct PDF URLs. The forms page at azacp.com/forms/ was easily accessible (linked from main nav as "Patient Forms") and listed all forms clearly.

## Downloaded Forms

| File | Source URL | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| form-1.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Medical_Records_Release_Form.pdf | **General Authorization to Release Medical Information** — Standard ACP ROI form. Includes patient info, release from/to fields, purpose checkboxes, record type selection (general vs. protected records like HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse). Offers paper, disc (PDF), and email delivery options. 1-year expiration (60 days for drug/alcohol records). |
| form-2.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/AFP-Records-Release.pdf | **Authorization to Disclose Medical Information (Associates in Family Practice)** — Pre-filled variant of the ROI form with "Associates in Family Practice" (a specific ACP practice location at 6565 E. Carondelet Dr, Tucson) as the receiving party. Same structure as form-1. |
| form-3.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Adult-Release-of-Information-Form-116.pdf | **Adult Release of Information Form** — Designates who can access patient's medical records (appointments, billing, test results). Lists authorized persons by name/relationship. Includes voicemail permission and "do not release" section. More of a standing consent/access designation than a one-time records request. |
| form-4.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Records-Release-Imaging.pdf | **Authorization to Release Medical Information (Imaging/Radiology)** — Specific to ACP Northwest Imaging and ACP Eastside Imaging. Allows requesting reports only or digital images. Delivery options: mail, pick up, email, fax. |
| form-5.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Minor-Release-of-Information-Form-116.pdf | **Minor Release of Information Form** — Designates who can access a child's medical records. Lists authorized persons (parents/guardians, other adults). Includes appointment transport permission. |
| form-6.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Minor-Release-of-Information-Form-116-Spanish.pdf | **Minor Release of Information Form (Spanish)** — Spanish-language version of form-5. |
| form-7.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/HIPAA-Amendment-Request.pdf | **HIPAA Amendment Request Form** — For patients to request corrections to their medical records. Not an ROI form but related to HIPAA patient rights. |

## Additional Notes

- The forms page also links to a **"Medical Records Electronic Self Request"** via https://www.swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html — an online wizard for electronic records requests (not a downloadable PDF).
- All forms are flat PDFs (no fillable fields visible) with text layers — they appear designed for printing and hand-filling.
- form-1.pdf is the primary general-purpose ROI form. form-2.pdf is a practice-specific variant. form-3.pdf and form-5.pdf are standing access designation forms rather than one-time release authorizations.
- No difficulties encountered — forms were easy to find and download directly.
- An initial attempt to download a minor release form from a different URL (tucsoncentralpediatrics.com, returned by search) yielded an HTML page instead of a PDF; the correct URL was found on the azacp.com forms page.

# Desert Regional Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: Desert Regional Medical Center
- **Website**: https://www.desertcarenetwork.com
- **Location**: Palm Springs, CA
- **Parent System**: Desert Care Network (part of Tenet Healthcare)

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `"Desert Regional Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct PDF results.
2. **Web search for site-specific content**: Searched `site:desertcarenetwork.com authorization release medical records` — found the dedicated medical records request page at https://www.desertcarenetwork.com/patients/request-medical-records.
3. **Navigated the website**: The medical records page clearly lists download links for ROI forms for each hospital in the Desert Care Network, including Desert Regional Medical Center in both English and Spanish.

## What Worked
The site search (`site:desertcarenetwork.com`) immediately found the medical records page. The page is well-organized with direct download links labeled by hospital and language.

## Difficulties
- **Cloudflare bot protection**: Direct `curl` downloads were blocked by Cloudflare's "Just a moment..." challenge page. Had to use Chrome DevTools browser to bypass the protection and download the PDFs via in-page JavaScript `fetch()`.
- **Chrome PDF viewer wrapper**: The browser's network request capture saved the Chrome PDF viewer HTML wrapper instead of the actual PDF content. Worked around this by using `fetch()` within the page context to get the raw PDF bytes as base64.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.desertcarenetwork.com/docs/desertcarenetworklibraries/default-document-library/desert-regional-medical-center-roi-form-2025f689a0d6-a5bc-4d09-8b16-dfa7c3c87cbd.pdf?sfvrsn=6159096f_1

# Canton-Potsdam Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Canton-Potsdam Hospital (CPH)
- **Location**: 50 Leroy St, Potsdam, NY 13676
- **Website**: https://www.rochesterregional.org (parent system)
- **Parent System**: St. Lawrence Health (SLH), which is part of Rochester Regional Health (RRH)
- **Type**: Community hospital, nonprofit, northeast

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web searches (multiple queries)
- `"Canton-Potsdam Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form`
- `Rochester Regional Health "release of information" "authorization" form filetype:pdf`
- `"St. Lawrence Health" medical records authorization release form`
- `site:rochesterregional.org "release of information" OR "medical records"`
- Various other keyword combinations — none returned a direct downloadable PDF form.

### 2. Rochester Regional Health website navigation
- Visited https://www.rochesterregional.org/patients-visitors/medical-records — the medical records page uses an online tool (Swellbox/Datavant) for record requests but **explicitly states**: "St. Lawrence Health is not currently available through this application, for information on requesting these records call (315) 769-4386."
- Visited https://www.rochesterregional.org/policies — Policies & Forms page lists various patient forms but no ROI/authorization form download.
- Visited https://www.rochesterregional.org/locations/hospitals/potsdam — Canton-Potsdam Hospital page has general info and MyCare portal link but no forms.

### 3. St. Lawrence Health System website (stlawrencehealthsystem.org)
- This domain now redirects to rochesterregional.org.
- Used the Wayback Machine CDX API to search all archived PDFs from the old SLH site.
- Found the archived "Patient Forms and Notices" page — it listed patient rights documents but NOT a general ROI form.
- Found two relevant authorization forms in the archived files:
  - A COVID-specific pre-filled OCA-960 form (in the COVID toolkit section)
  - A blank OCA-960 form (in the patients-and-visitors section)

### 4. What worked
- The **Wayback Machine CDX API** was the most productive tool, allowing systematic discovery of all PDFs ever hosted on the old stlawrencehealthsystem.org domain. This revealed the OCA-960 forms that were the only authorization forms published by the organization.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://web.archive.org/web/2022/https://www.stlawrencehealthsystem.org/-/media/slh/files/covid-toolkit/authorization-for-release-of-health-information--covid19-as-of-81820.pdf`
- **Original URL**: `https://www.stlawrencehealthsystem.org/-/media/slh/files/covid-toolkit/authorization-for-release-of-health-information--covid19-as-of-81820.pdf`
- **What it is**: OCA Official Form No. 960 — "Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA" — pre-filled with "COVID-19 Test Result" in the records section. This is a scanned (image-only) copy of the NY State standard form, used specifically for COVID test result release authorization.
- **Pages**: 1
- **File size**: 113,357 bytes
- **Technical notes**: Image-only scan from RICOH MP C4504 copier, no text layer, no fillable fields, landscape orientation rotated.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://web.archive.org/web/2022/https://www.stlawrencehealthsystem.org/-/media/slh/patients-and-visitors/oca-960-form.pdf`
- **Original URL**: `https://www.stlawrencehealthsystem.org/-/media/slh/patients-and-visitors/oca-960-form.pdf`
- **What it is**: Blank OCA Official Form No. 960 — "Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA." This is the general-purpose NY State HIPAA authorization form. Page 2 contains instructions for use. This is the general ROI form that St. Lawrence Health published for patients.
- **Pages**: 2
- **File size**: 127,880 bytes
- **Technical notes**: Has text layer (though garbled in pdftotext due to font encoding issues), no fillable fields. Not a scan — digitally produced from PScript5.dll/Acrobat Distiller.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://web.archive.org/web/2024/https://www.stlawrencehealthsystem.org/-/media/slh/patients-and-visitors/slhs-notice-of-privacy-practices-11921.pdf`
- **Original URL**: `https://www.stlawrencehealthsystem.org/-/media/slh/patients-and-visitors/slhs-notice-of-privacy-practices-11921.pdf`
- **What it is**: Notice of Privacy Practices for St. Lawrence Health System, effective July 11, 2016. Explains how medical information can be used and disclosed, and how patients can access their records.
- **Pages**: Multiple
- **Technical notes**: Has text layer, clean text extraction.

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **Website transition**: St. Lawrence Health's website (stlawrencehealthsystem.org) has been absorbed into Rochester Regional Health's main site (rochesterregional.org). The old domain now redirects. This means previously published forms are no longer directly accessible.

2. **No general ROI form published online**: Neither the current Rochester Regional Health site nor the archived St. Lawrence Health site published a custom, organization-specific ROI/authorization form. The only authorization form available was the generic NY State OCA-960 form.

3. **Online records tool excludes St. Lawrence Health**: Rochester Regional's Swellbox/Datavant online records request tool explicitly excludes St. Lawrence Health facilities, directing patients to call (315) 769-4386 instead.

4. **No Wayback Machine capture of medical records page**: The old SLH website apparently never had a dedicated "medical records" page — the CDX API returned zero results for any URL containing "medical" or "record" under the stlawrencehealthsystem.org domain.

5. **Image-only scan**: The COVID authorization form (form-1) is a scanned copy with no text layer, making it impossible to fill digitally.

## Summary

Canton-Potsdam Hospital / St. Lawrence Health does not appear to have ever published a custom ROI form online. They relied on the standard NY State OCA-960 form, which was available on their old website. The current process directs patients to call for medical records requests. The organization is in a transitional state between the old St. Lawrence Health System infrastructure and the Rochester Regional Health platform.

# Garfield Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Garfield Medical Center
- **Website:** https://www.ahmchealth.com/gmc/
- **Location:** Monterey Park, CA
- **Parent System:** AHMC Healthcare Inc.

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Garfield Medical Center authorization release health information filetype:pdf"** — did not return direct hits but confirmed the organization exists.
2. **Web search for "Garfield Medical Center Monterey Park medical records release form filetype:pdf"** — found a direct link to the PHI authorization form at `ahmchealth.com/gmc/documents/`.
3. **Web search for "site:ahmchealth.com authorization release medical records"** — found both a GMC-specific form and a patient authorization form under a different path (`/gmc/docs/`). Also confirmed AHMC uses similar forms across its hospital system.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ahmchealth.com/gmc/documents/GMC-AUTHORIZATION-FOR-USE-OR-DISCLOSURE-OF-PHI.pdf
- **HTTP Status:** 200
- **File Size:** 271,120 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **PDF Version:** 1.4
- **Document Type:** ROI / Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information
- **Description:** Two-page authorization form specific to Garfield Medical Center. Includes patient information, release-to section, purpose checkboxes (insurance, personal use, continuing care, legal, other), detailed record type selection (H&P, discharge summary, operative report, lab, radiology, etc.), special authorization for sensitive information (mental health), signature/date fields, and California Health and Safety Code fee references. Has text layer; appears to be a digitally-created form rather than a scan.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ahmchealth.com/gmc/docs/Patient_Authorization_Form_for_Medical_Records.pdf
- **HTTP Status:** 200
- **File Size:** 92,735 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **PDF Version:** 1.5
- **Document Type:** ROI / Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information
- **Description:** Very similar to form-1.pdf — same general structure and content, with minor layout differences (field ordering, spacing). Also a Garfield Medical Center-specific authorization form. Smaller file size, slightly different PDF version. Likely an older or alternate version of the same form hosted at a different URL path (`/docs/` vs `/documents/`).

## Difficulties
- None significant. Both forms were easily found via web search and downloaded without issues (no bot blocking, no login required).
- The two forms are very similar but not identical — minor layout differences suggest they may be different versions maintained at different URL paths.

## Summary
Two versions of Garfield Medical Center's ROI authorization form were found and downloaded. Both are digitally-created PDFs with text layers, specific to GMC, and cover standard authorization fields including record type selection, purpose, and California fee disclosures.

# Tioga Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies
1. **Web search** for `Tioga Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found the HIM page at https://www.tiogahealth.org/him
2. **Site-specific search** for `site:tiogahealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed same HIM page
3. **Direct navigation** to the HIM page to locate download links

## What Worked
The web search was sufficient. The form is directly linked from the Health Information Management page (https://www.tiogahealth.org/him), which is accessible from the site navigation under TMC. Both Word and PDF versions are offered.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.tiogahealth.org/_files/ugd/51e5d7_89494c330746455abd75cb844132f681.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Medical/Confidential Information
- **Description**: Single-page scanned form titled "Tioga Medical Center Hospital/Clinic — Authorization for Release of Medical/Confidential Information." Includes fields for patient name, DOB, address, release-from/release-to facility info, dates of service, purpose checkboxes (continuation of services, follow-up treatment, establishing care, referral, legal proceedings, other), type of information checkboxes (emergency room record, history & physical, discharge summary, consultation reports, physician orders, laboratory reports, radiology reports, EKG/EEG reports, nurses notes, progress notes, clinic notes, other — with a "Records from / to" and "Number of Pages" field). Also includes authorization for sensitive records (alcohol/drug, mental health, HIV/AIDS). Has signature lines for patient, parent/guardian, and witness. States authorization remains in effect for 6 months.
- **Format**: Image-only scan (CCITT fax encoding, 1704×2199 pixels, 200 DPI grayscale). No text layer, no fillable fields, no embedded fonts.
- **File size**: 52,290 bytes
- **Pages**: 1

## Difficulties
- The PDF is an image-only scan with no text layer, making it impossible to extract text via pdftotext. The form content was confirmed visually via screenshot.
- The form appears to be a scan of a paper form rather than a digitally-created document.

## Other Documents Available on HIM Page
The HIM page also links to:
- Release of Information Form (Word format) — same form in .docx
- HIPAA / Notice of Privacy Practices (.doc and .pdf versions)
- Various other documents (Advance Directive, ACO info, Community Health Needs Assessment, etc.)

# Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers
- **Website:** https://www.ironwoodcrc.com
- **Location:** Chandler, AZ
- **Type:** Physician practice, independent, for-profit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Ironwood Cancer Research Centers" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — initial search did not return direct links.
2. **Web search** for `"Ironwood Cancer Research Centers" "medical records" "release form" PDF` — found direct link to fillable medical records request form on ironwoodcrc.com.
3. **Web search** for `site:ironwoodcrc.com authorization release medical records` — found both the fillable request form and an older authorization to release form (2019).
4. **Web search** for `site:ironwoodcrc.com filetype:pdf medical records` — confirmed the two forms above and also found a new patient forms packet on ironwoodwomenscenters.com (related site).
5. **Browsed** https://www.ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/ — page exists but had no direct PDF links visible in the fetched content.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ironwoodcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Medical-Records-RequestForm-to-request-from-other-facilities_FILLABLE.pdf
- **File size:** 435,431 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information TO Ironwood" — This is a fillable PDF form for patients to authorize OTHER facilities to send records TO Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers (i.e., incoming records for continuing care). Lists all Ironwood physicians. It's an incoming records request form rather than a patient-access ROI form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ironwoodcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Authorization-to-release-protected-health-information.pdf
- **File size:** 156,959 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — This is the main ROI form authorizing Ironwood Physicians, PC to release a patient's protected health information. Includes fields for patient info, recipient info, requested information types (physician's notes, lab reports, radiology reports, biopsy reports, prescriptions, radiology imaging), date range, purpose (personal use, continued care, legal, insurance, disability), and method of delivery (fax, secure email, mail, pick up, patient portal). Has text layer.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ironwoodwomenscenters.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/New-Patient-Forms.pdf
- **File size:** 2,375,931 bytes
- **Description:** New patient forms packet (multi-page). Includes patient demographics, patient history, medication/allergy list, "Consent to Release Protected Health Information Contact List" (HIPAA contact list — authorizes Ironwood to share info with specific named individuals involved in care), financial policy/assignment of benefits, and other onboarding forms. The consent form within is a HIPAA contact list, not a traditional ROI form.

## Difficulties
- The patient forms page (https://www.ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/) did not have visible links to downloadable forms when fetched — may require JavaScript rendering or the forms were removed.
- The new patient forms packet was hosted on ironwoodwomenscenters.com (a related/sister site) rather than the main ironwoodcrc.com domain.
- No difficulties with downloading — all URLs returned valid PDFs without bot blocking.

## Summary
Found the primary ROI form (form-2.pdf) which is a straightforward authorization to release protected health information with multiple delivery method options including patient portal and secure email. Form-1 is the reverse direction (requesting records from other facilities into Ironwood). Form-3 is a new patient packet containing a HIPAA contact list consent form.

- **Name**: Schweiger Dermatology Group
- **Website**: https://www.schweigerderm.com
- **Location**: New York, NY (multi-state practice with hundreds of locations)

## Search Strategies Tried

### 1. Web Searches (multiple queries)
- `"Schweiger Dermatology Group" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No results
- `"Schweiger Dermatology Group" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — No results
- `site:schweigerderm.com authorization release medical records` — No direct form found

- `"Schweiger Dermatology" records request MediCopy OR Ciox OR Verisma OR ShareCare` — No third-party ROI vendor found
- `schweigerderm.com wp-content uploads form authorization` — No results

### 2. Website Navigation
- **Homepage**: Checked "Patient Resources" section — only links to Patient Portal, Insurances Accepted, Financial Responsibility, Pay Bill, Safety Protocols, and Shop
- **FAQ page** (schweigerderm.com/frequently-asked-questions/): No mention of medical records requests or release forms
- **Contact Us page**: Generic contact form, no mention of medical records
- **Privacy Policy page**: Standard website privacy policy; mentions HIPAA data is covered under a separate policy but doesn't link to a form
- **Patient Financial Responsibility page**: No mention of records or forms
- **"Patient Information" expandable buttons**: Present on multiple pages but did not reveal forms content

### 3. Sitemap Analysis
- Downloaded and analyzed both page sitemaps (241 pages total)
- Searched for URLs containing: record, release, authorization, form, hipaa, privacy, patient, request, notice, consent, register, portal, health-information, patient-rights
- Found only: clinical-research-studies-form, marketing-support-form, video-submission-form, acquisition-intake-form — none related to medical records
- Also checked post sitemaps — only press releases and skin care articles

### 4. Common URL Patterns
Tested the following URLs (all returned 404):
- /medical-records/
- /patient-forms/
- /forms/
- /hipaa/
- /notice-of-privacy-practices/
- /records-request/
- /release-of-information/

### 5. Direct PDF URL Guessing
Tried common wp-content/uploads paths with variations of medical-records-release, authorization-form, HIPAA-authorization, release-of-information, roi-form, patient-forms, notice-of-privacy — all returned 404.

## Result

**No ROI / Authorization for Medical Records form was found online.**

Schweiger Dermatology Group does not publish a downloadable ROI or medical records release form on their public website. All search strategies (web searches, website navigation, sitemap analysis, direct URL guessing) confirmed this finding.

The organization directs patients to:
1. **Patient Portal** (https://schweigerderm.ema.md/ema/PatientLogin.action) — login required
2. **Phone**: 844-DERM-DOC or 212-283-3000
3. **Text**: (646) 558-6696

No Notice of Privacy Practices document was found published on the website either, though the privacy policy mentions that HIPAA-covered information is handled under a separate policy.

## Downloaded Forms
None — no forms were available for download.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The organization has a large web presence (hundreds of location pages, many providers) but very limited patient resources/forms available publicly
- Google search was blocked (CAPTCHA) when attempted through the browser
- No third-party medical records release vendor (MediCopy, Ciox, etc.) appears to be used
- Forms appear to be exclusively available through the patient portal (behind login) or by contacting the office directly

# EyeSouth Partners — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a **practice management organization (PMO)** headquartered in Atlanta, GA. It is not a direct clinical practice but rather a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. The main website (eyesouthpartners.com) is corporate/partnership-focused with no patient-facing forms or medical records pages.

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **EyeSouth Partners is a PMO, not a clinical practice** — The main website has no patient-facing content, no forms, no medical records request process. This is a significant barrier for patients who may not know which specific affiliated practice to contact.

2. **No centralized ROI form** — Despite being a HIPAA covered entity with a Privacy Officer, EyeSouth Partners does not provide a downloadable authorization form. Patients must write to the Privacy Officer or go through individual affiliated practices.

3. **Inconsistent approach across affiliates** — Some practices use Sharecare online portals (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye), while others offer downloadable PDFs (Georgia Retina, Center for Sight). This fragmented approach makes it difficult for patients to know how to request their records.

4. **Georgia Retina initial download attempt returned HTML** — The first URL tried (from an older WordPress upload path) redirected to an HTML page. The correct URL was found by navigating the practice website directly.

5. **Georgia Eye Partners forms page 404** — The founding practice's patient forms page no longer exists, suggesting a recent website change.

# Wayne County Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Wayne County Hospital
- **Location:** Monticello, KY 42633
- **Website:** https://waynehospital.org/
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms:** Searched for `"Wayne County Hospital" Monticello KY "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — found a direct PDF link at `waynehospital.org/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf`.
2. **Web search for medical records release:** Searched for `"Wayne County Hospital" Monticello Kentucky medical records release form` — found the hospital has both an online web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` and the downloadable PDF.
3. **Website navigation:** Browsed the hospital website's homepage, Departments page, and Health Information Management page. The HIM page provides contact info (606-340-3227) but does not link directly to the downloadable PDF form. The homepage does not have a direct link to medical records forms either.
4. **Checked for other Wayne County Hospital sites:** Confirmed that `waynecountyhospital.org` is a different hospital in Corydon, Iowa — not related to this organization.

## What Worked
- The direct web search for PDF forms on waynehospital.org was the most effective approach, immediately surfacing the downloadable PDF.
- The hospital also offers an online web-based release form at https://waynehospital.org/Release-of-Health-Form (not a PDF — it's an HTML form on their website).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://waynehospital.org/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf
- **File size:** 71,933 bytes (~70 KB)
- **Pages:** 1
- **Document type:** Request to Review/Receive Medical Information form
- **Description:** A single-page PDF titled "WAYNE COUNTY HOSPITAL — REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." It includes fields for patient identification (name, DOB, address, phone), delivery method (fax, email, mail, pick-up), record type (self, child, other), dates of service, specific information requested (discharge summary, H&P, operative report, lab, radiology, etc.), reason for request, and identification presented. References KRS 422.317 regarding free first copy. Has text layer (not an image-only scan). Appears to be a flat PDF (no fillable fields visible from pdftotext output). Form is designed for patients requesting their own records or those of their children.

## Difficulties
- The HIM department page on the website does not link directly to the downloadable PDF form — the form was found only through web search finding the direct URL in the `/files/galleries/` directory.
- The hospital's website is relatively simple and lacks a dedicated "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section.
- The online web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` is a separate mechanism from the PDF — it captures the same information but as an HTML form submission rather than a downloadable document.

## Additional Notes
- The hospital also offers an online Release of Health Form (web-based, not PDF) at https://waynehospital.org/Release-of-Health-Form. This is a web form that collects patient info, delivery preference, record type, dates, specific information requested, and reason — functionally equivalent to the PDF but submitted electronically.
- Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed critical access facility in rural Kentucky.

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"JPS Health Network" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for `"JPS Health Network" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found the main ROI form URL and HIE-related forms.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://jpshealthnet.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/roi_english_revised_2018_10.pdf

## Difficulties
- The main ROI form (form-1.pdf) is an **image-only scan** from 2018 with no text layer and no fillable fields. This is a significant accessibility barrier.
- The page states "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time" — patients must print, fill, and mail/fax.
- The page also notes that patients must present government-issued photo ID at pickup.
- Fee schedule is disclosed: $30 for first 10 pages, then per-page charges. Electronic/digital delivery costs a flat $75.

## Retrieval Difficulty
**Easy** — The form is findable on the Patient Records page within 2 clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records). Web search also returned the direct PDF URL.

# AdventHealth Central Texas — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "AdventHealth Central Texas authorization release health information medical records form PDF" — immediately surfaced two direct PDF links from adventhealth.com.
2. **Web search** for AdventHealth system-wide ROI forms — confirmed the same URLs and identified the parent system's medical records page at adventhealth.com/medical-records.
3. **Site-specific search** for adventhealth.com medical records — confirmed records request process and contact information.

The first web search was sufficient; both forms were directly linked from AdventHealth's CDN.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.adventhealth.com/sites/default/files/assets/ADV-8000003A_Authorization_for_Release_of_Patient_Health_Information.pdf
- **File size**: 271,086 bytes (2 pages)
- **Document type**: System-wide AdventHealth Authorization for Release of Patient Health Information (form ADV-800003A, rev 4/2022)

Includes 12 sections: patient info, disclosure details, purpose, record types (with behavioral health and substance abuse sections), authorization expiration, and signatures. References Illinois Mental Health and Development Disabilities Confidentiality Act, suggesting it's a system-wide template not tailored to Texas. Has text layer, appears to be a digitally-created PDF.

References HIPAA (45 CFR 164.501). Has text layer, digitally-created PDF.

## Difficulties

- None. Both forms were easily discoverable via web search and downloaded without issues (no bot blocking, no login walls).
- The system-wide form (form-1) references Illinois law despite being served in a Texas context, which is a notable finding for the evaluation stage.

## Organization
- **Name**: Southwell (Tift Regional Health System)

4. **HTML scraping** of `https://mysouthwell.com/medical-release/` — extracted all PDF links on the page, revealing additional forms.

The medical release page is found under **Home → Patient & Visitors → Medical Release** on the website.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf

- **Document type**: Release of Information form (image-only scan)
- **Description**: A newer (July 2025 upload date) single-page form that is an image-only scan with no extractable text. 75KB file. Cannot determine exact content without OCR, but title suggests it is a Release of Information form. This may be a more recent version of the ROI form or a different variant.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://mysouthwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SWA-Authorization-for-Release-of-Records-Clean.pdf

- Form-2.pdf is an image-only scan with no text layer, making content analysis impossible without OCR.

# Valley Medical Group — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Valley Medical Group
- **Website:** https://www.vmgma.com
- **Location:** Amherst, MA (also Easthampton, Greenfield, Northampton)
- **Type:** Independent physician practice, for-profit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Valley Medical Group Amherst MA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — no direct VMG-specific form found.
2. **Web search** for `site:vmgma.com medical records release authorization` — no ROI form on vmgma.com.
3. **Web search** for `vmgma.com filetype:pdf` — found community resource PDFs, brochures, and health info PDFs, but no ROI/authorization form.
4. **Website navigation** — visited vmgma.com homepage, Resources page, Welcome Letter page, and Patient Information section. No downloadable ROI form found on the site.
5. **Key discovery on homepage:** VMG has a prominent "REQUEST RECORDS" link pointing to **https://medicopy.net/patients** — a third-party Release of Information service (MediCopy).
6. **MediCopy ROI page** (https://medicopy.net/landing/roi) — found downloadable PDF authorization forms in English and Spanish, plus online HelloSign forms.

## What Was Found

Valley Medical Group does **not** publish its own ROI/authorization form. Instead, they outsource medical records release to **MediCopy**, a third-party Health Information Management company based in Nashville, TN. The vmgma.com website links directly to MediCopy's patient portal from both the homepage header and the footer "REQUEST RECORDS" link.

MediCopy provides:
- An online authorization form via HelloSign (https://app.hellosign.com/s/01LCH5zj)
- Downloadable PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish)

**Note:** One web search result confused this Valley Medical Group (Amherst, MA — vmgma.com) with Valley Medical Group (part of Valley Health System in NJ — valleyhealth.com). These are completely different organizations. The valleyhealth.com authorization form is NOT for this practice.

- **File size:** ~278 KB
- **Has text layer:** Yes
- **Notes:** Spanish-language version of the same MediCopy authorization form.

## Difficulties
- VMG does not host any ROI form on their own website — they fully delegate to MediCopy.
- The forms are generic MediCopy forms, not customized for Valley Medical Group.
- Multiple "Valley Medical Group" organizations exist nationally, creating potential confusion in search results.
- The vmgma.com website is built on Wix and is primarily informational — patient forms and records are handled through external services (Athena patient portal, MediCopy).

## Retrieval Difficulty
**Moderate** — The form is not on vmgma.com itself, but the "REQUEST RECORDS" link to MediCopy is visible on the homepage. From MediCopy's site, the PDF authorization form is 2 clicks away.

# Huntington Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Huntington Hospital
- **Website**: https://huntington.northwell.edu/
- **Location**: Huntington, NY
- **Parent System**: Northwell Health

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for Huntington Hospital + authorization + release + health information + PDF**: Initial results conflated with Huntington Hospital in California (Huntington Health). Clarified by adding "Northwell" to searches.

2. **Web search for Northwell Health ROI form**: Found direct PDF links on northwell.edu. Northwell publishes system-wide forms used across all their facilities including Huntington Hospital.

3. **Web search for site:huntington.northwell.edu medical records**: Found that Huntington Hospital directs patients to the Northwell Health system-level forms. Also discovered a separate "Request for Access" form specifically for patient self-requests (distinct from the general third-party ROI form).

## What Worked
Searching for the parent system (Northwell Health) forms was the most effective strategy. Huntington Hospital does not publish its own facility-specific forms — it uses Northwell's system-wide forms hosted at northwell.edu.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.northwell.edu/sites/northwell.edu/files/2022-03/release-of-health-information-form-english.pdf
- **Document**: Authorization for Release of Health Information (VD001, dated 9/28/21)
- **Description**: General third-party ROI form. 3 pages. Allows specifying from/to entities, delivery method (mail, pickup, email, fax), record types, date ranges, and sensitive information opt-outs (substance abuse, mental health, HIV). Includes signature and witness sections.
- **Impression**: Standard ROI/authorization form for releasing records to third parties.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.northwell.edu/sites/northwell.edu/files/2022-03/release-of-health-information-form-instructions.pdf
- **Document**: Instructions for Completing the Authorization for Release of Health Information Form
- **Description**: 3-page instruction document explaining how to fill out form-1. Includes annotated examples with "X" marks showing where to fill in fields.
- **Impression**: Companion instructions document for the ROI form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.northwell.edu/sites/northwell.edu/files/2022-03/request-for-access-to-health-information-form-english-2022.pdf
- **Document**: Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative (VD087, dated 9/28/21)
- **Description**: 2 pages. Patient-specific access form that explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524. Allows patients to request their own records or direct them to another person/entity. Same delivery options as form-1 (mail, pickup, email, fax, USB, CD). Includes sections for substance use disorder and HIV/AIDS information with required purpose and expiration date.
- **Impression**: This is the patient-access-specific form — distinct from the general ROI form. Notably references HIPAA right of access directly.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.northwell.edu/sites/northwell.edu/files/2022-03/request-for-access-to-health-form-instructions.pdf
- **Document**: Instructions for Completing the Request for Access to Health Information by the Patient or Personal Representative
- **Description**: 2-page instruction document with annotated examples for completing form-3.
- **Impression**: Companion instructions for the patient access form.

## Difficulties
- Initial search results confused Huntington Hospital (NY/Northwell) with Huntington Hospital (CA/Huntington Health). Resolved by including "Northwell" in queries.
- No facility-specific forms exist — all forms are system-level Northwell Health documents.

## Key Observations
- Northwell Health maintains two distinct form types: a general "Authorization for Release" (third-party) and a patient-specific "Request for Access" form.
- The patient access form (form-3) explicitly cites HIPAA 45 CFR 164.524, which is a positive compliance signal.
- Both forms offer multiple delivery formats including electronic options (secure/unsecure email, USB, CD, fax).
- Forms appear to be fillable PDFs with checkboxes and text fields.
- Retrieval difficulty: **easy** — forms are directly linked from the Northwell Health medical records page.

# Colquitt Regional Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Colquitt Regional Medical Center
- **Website**: https://colquittregional.com
- **Location**: Moultrie, GA
- **Type**: Community hospital, independent, government-owned

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Colquitt Regional Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — did not return a direct PDF link but pointed to the Health Records page on their website.
2. **Web search** for `site:colquittregional.com medical records release authorization` — successfully identified the page https://colquittregional.com/patients-visitors/health-records-patient-portal/ as the location for the form.
3. **Website navigation** — navigated to the Health Records & Patient Portal page using the browser to find the direct PDF download link, which was embedded as a "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button.

**What worked**: The site-scoped web search quickly identified the correct page. The form link was clearly labeled on the Health Records & Patient Portal page under "Request for Medical Records."

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://colquittregional.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Authorization-to-Use-or-Disclose-Health-Information-Form-04-23-2021.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information (ROI form)
- **Pages**: 1
- **File size**: 285,895 bytes (~286 KB)
- **Has text layer**: No (image-only scan)
- **Fillable fields**: None
- **Description**: A single-page scanned form titled "AUTHORIZATION TO USE OR DISCLOSE HEALTH INFORMATION." Includes fields for patient name, health record #, DOB, and label. Contains checkboxes for record types (Discharge Summary, History & Physical, Operative Report, Lab Work, X-Rays, EKG/Echo, Pathology Reports, E.R. Report, Progress Notes, Physician's Orders, Nurses Notes, Face Sheet). Includes sections for: disclosure recipient, purpose of disclosure, revocation rights (referencing CRMC Privacy Officer), authorization expiration, re-disclosure warning, and signature lines for patient/legal representative and witness. Branded with Colquitt Regional Medical Center logo and barcode.

## Difficulties
- The form is an **image-only scan** with essentially no extractable text layer, making it inaccessible to screen readers and not fillable digitally.
- The form was created on April 23, 2021, and appears to be a scan of a paper form rather than a digitally-designed document.
- Finding the form was straightforward — it was 2 clicks deep (Patients & Visitors → Health Records & Patient Portal → Download link).

## Retrieval Difficulty
**Easy** — The form was clearly linked from the Health Records page with a descriptive download button label.

Notably offers electronic delivery options including email and removable media with password protection options.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.merithealthcentral.com/Uploads/Public/Documents/all-new-documents/HIM-1406S.pdf
- **File size:** 284,813 bytes
- **Document type:** Authorization for Release of Health Information (Spanish version)
- **Initial impression:** Spanish translation of the same ROI form (HIM-1406S). Contains identical structure and fields as the English version. Larger file size may indicate different font embedding for Spanish characters.

## Difficulties
- None. The forms were prominently linked on the medical records request page and downloaded without any issues.

## Additional Observations
- The website also offers an online request process via Swellbox (https://www.swellbox.com/merit-health-jackson-wizard.html) as an alternative to the downloadable PDF form.
- The page distinguishes between patient/patient representative requests and provider requests.
- FAQ section on the page addresses authorization expiration, charges, and who can request records.

# Western Washington Medical Group — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG)
- **Website**: https://www.wwmedgroup.com
- **Location**: Everett, WA
- **Type**: Independent physician practice (for-profit)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release form PDF**: Searched for `Western Washington Medical Group Everett WA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`. Did not return direct PDF links but pointed toward the WWMG website.

2. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:wwmedgroup.com "medical records" "release form"`. This was highly effective — returned direct links to two PDF forms on wwmedgroup.com and identified their medical records request page.

3. **Follow-up search for additional forms**: Found a third form hosted on PatientPop (sa1s3.patientpop.com), likely from a prior version of their website or a different practice within the group.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.wwmedgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/WWMG-Medical-Records-release-form-fillable-PDF-0824.pdf
- **File size**: 142,705 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization for Western Washington Medical Group to RELEASE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION" — the main WWMG medical records release form. Fillable PDF (dated 0824, likely August 2024). Allows patients to specify records by condition, date range, or mutual exchange. Includes checkboxes for excluding sensitive information (HIV, STDs, psychiatric, substance abuse). Lists purposes including attorney, insurance, personal, continuing care, and disability. Addresses: 1728 W. Marine View Dr., Suite 110, Everett, WA 98201.
- **Initial impression**: Primary ROI/authorization form for the organization. Appears to be a well-structured fillable PDF.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.wwmedgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/Authorization-for-Release-of-Information-Medical-Records-WWMG-GI.pdf
- **File size**: 122,028 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization for Release of Information" — a GI (Gastroenterology) department-specific release form for WWMG. Pre-filled with GI department address (4225 Hoyt Ave, Ste A, Everett, WA 98203). Includes sensitive information opt-in checkboxes, 90-day expiration policy, and detailed HIPAA rights language. Dated 01/01/2023.
- **Initial impression**: Specialty-specific ROI form (Gastroenterology). More detailed HIPAA compliance language than form-1. Notable 90-day expiration restriction.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/223399.pdf
- **File size**: 24,164 bytes
- **Description**: "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS" — a simpler, more generic release form. No WWMG branding visible in the text. Hosted on PatientPop (a practice management/marketing platform). Very basic form with free-text fields for patient info, information requested, purpose, and recipient.
- **Initial impression**: Generic/older authorization form, possibly from a PatientPop-managed page for WWMG. Much simpler than the other two forms and lacks WWMG-specific branding.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The forms were readily available on the WWMG website. The site-specific search was effective and returned direct PDF links. No bot blocking or login walls encountered.

## Key URLs
- Medical Records Request page: https://www.wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/

# Vanderbilt University Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Vanderbilt University Medical Center authorization release health information form PDF" — returned multiple direct PDF links from vumc.org subdomains (student health, information-privacy-security) and third-party form sites.
2. **Web search** for "Vanderbilt University Medical Center medical records release form PDF" — confirmed same URLs plus the official vanderbilthealth.com medical records page.
3. **Web search** for "site:vanderbilthealth.com authorization release medical records" — identified the main patient-facing page and online request portals (Swellbox, ChartSwap).
4. **Navigated to** https://www.vanderbilthealth.com/information/medical-record-information — the official medical records page. Found the current authorization form links under "Request Records by Authorization Form" section, in both English and Spanish.

**What worked best**: The official vanderbilthealth.com medical records page had the current forms clearly linked. Web searches also surfaced older versions from VUMC subdomains that are still publicly accessible.

## Online Request Options

Vanderbilt also offers three online portals (not PDF-based):
- **Patient Medical Records Request**: https://www.swellbox.com/vanderbilt-umc-wizard.html
- **Provider Medical Records Request**: https://www.swellbox.com/vanderbilt-umc-provider-wizard.html
- **Third-Party Medical Records Request**: https://chartswap.com/

## Downloaded Forms

- **Source URL**: https://www.vumc.org/student-health/sites/default/files/Authorization%20for%20Release%20of%20Medical%20Information%20from%20VUMC-VMR%203017.pdf
- **Document**: "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (VMR 3017, dated 02/2022)

- **Pages**: 4
- **Description**: Even older version of the same release form. Includes separate return address options for Vanderbilt University Hospital vs. Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital. Has a "Medical Record Includes Records From" section listing specific facilities. Image-only scan, no usable text layer.

- **Document**: "Authorization for Release of Medical Information TO VUMC" (VMR 3022, dated 02/2022)
- **Pages**: 2
- **Description**: Form for authorizing release of records FROM another provider TO Vanderbilt (incoming records). Different form number (3022 vs 3017). Old VUMC branding. Image-only scan.

### form-4.pdf ⭐ (Current official English form)
- **Source URL**: https://files.vanderbilthealth.com/sites/default/files/2024-03/authorization-for-release-of-medical-information-eng.pdf
- **Document**: "Vanderbilt Health — Authorization for the Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (VMR 3017, dated 10/2023)

Has delivery options: Mail, Electronic ("View, print, or download as PDF through request portal"), or Other. Includes a fee schedule table.

- **Document**: Spanish language version of the current authorization form
- **Pages**: 2
- **Description**: Spanish translation of form-4. Same layout and structure. Image-only scan.

## Difficulties

- **All forms are image-only scans**: Every downloaded PDF is a scanned image at 96 DPI with essentially no text layer (only "Patient Label or Patient Identifiers" as extractable text). This means they are not fillable electronically and are not accessible for screen readers.
- **Multiple outdated versions still publicly accessible**: The VUMC student health and privacy/security subdomains still host older versions (2017, 2022) of the authorization form, which could confuse patients searching online.
- **No issues with download**: All PDFs downloaded successfully with curl; no bot blocking or login walls encountered.

# Pocahontas Memorial Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Pocahontas Memorial Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — returned generic template sites, no direct hospital link.
2. **Web search** for `site:pmhwv.org authorization release medical records` — successfully identified the direct PDF URL (`Authorization-to-release-PHI.pdf`) and the Medical Records page.
3. **Website navigation** — Confirmed the Medical Records page at `https://www.pmhwv.org/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/` which links to two downloadable PDFs.

## Difficulties

- **Bot blocking / redirect**: Direct `curl` download of the PDF returned HTML instead of the actual PDF. The site appears to have some form of bot protection (possibly via reCAPTCHA or similar). Successfully worked around this by using a browser environment to fetch the PDF content.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf

# SSM Health DePaul Hospital - St. Louis: ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** SSM Health DePaul Hospital - St. Louis
- **Location:** Bridgeton, MO
- **Website:** https://www.ssmhealth.com/locations/st-louis/depaul-hospital-st-louis
- **Parent System:** SSM Health (major nonprofit health system)

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web search for SSM Health authorization/release forms
- Searched for `SSM Health medical records release form authorization PDF`
- Found direct links to system-wide SSM Health ROI forms, including a general form and a St. Louis metro-specific form

### 2. Navigating SSM Health medical records page
- Visited https://www.ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records
- Page has location-dependent content; mentions that St. Louis metro area facilities have specific forms
- Also offers electronic request via MRO Express portal (mroexpress.mrocorp.com) for Missouri

### 3. DePaul Hospital location page
- Visited https://www.ssmhealth.com/locations/st-louis/depaul-hospital-st-louis
- The "Get Medical Records" link points to the same system-wide medical records page
- No DePaul-specific ROI form exists; the hospital uses SSM Health's system-wide forms

### 4. Direct URL guessing for DePaul-specific form
- Tried URL pattern `…/st-louis-metro/depaul-hospital-medical-records-request-form.pdf` — returned 302 to error page
- Confirmed no facility-specific form exists

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ssmhealth.com/getmedia/626ff70a-39ec-49a8-8f3f-903d077ae27d/medical-record-release-form.pdf
- **File size:** 86,620 bytes (1 page)
- **Document type:** ROI/Authorization form
- **Title:** SSMHC "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information"
- **Notes:** Older version of the SSM Health system-wide authorization form. Uses "SSMHC" (SSM Health Care) branding. Single page, flat PDF with text layer. Includes checkboxes for type of access (inspection, hard copy, electronic copy), specific record types, purpose of disclosure, and acknowledgement section with HIPAA-related language. Has fields for both disclosure-from and disclosure-to parties.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ssmhealth.com/SSMHealth/media/Documents/patients-and-visitors/get-medical-records/st-louis-metro/medical-records-request-form-stl.pdf
- **File size:** 293,571 bytes
- **Document type:** ROI/Authorization form (St. Louis metro area version)
- **Title:** SSM Health "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information"
- **Notes:** Updated version using current "SSM Health" branding, specifically for St. Louis metro area facilities including DePaul Hospital. Similar content to form-1 but with some additions (e.g., psychotherapy notes option, email delivery option). This is the form DePaul Hospital patients would be directed to use. Includes text layer; appears to have form fields based on larger file size.

## Difficulties
- The SSM Health medical records page uses location-based dynamic content loading, but the location selector's autocomplete didn't populate options when tested via browser
- No DePaul-specific form exists; the hospital relies on SSM Health's system-wide forms
- The earlier web_fetch of the raw HTML showed that facility-specific tabs may exist for St. Louis metro area, but they load the same STL metro form

## Summary
SSM Health uses system-wide ROI forms rather than facility-specific ones. For DePaul Hospital in the St. Louis metro area, form-2.pdf (the STL metro version) is the applicable form. Form-1.pdf is an older/general version of the same authorization form. Both are legitimate ROI/authorization forms with text layers.

- Checked all pages in sitemap — no forms/patient-forms page exists
- Privacy Policy page is an HTML page (not PDF), contains standard HIPAA NPP text

### 3. Wayback Machine / archived PDFs
- Searched Wayback Machine CDX API for all PDFs on mhhs.healthcare
- Found 12 PDFs total — none are ROI/authorization forms
- Old domain (minniehamilton.com) only had an employment application PDF

### 4. ChartRequest platform
- Navigated to https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville
- This is a third-party electronic records request portal
- Patients must create an account to request records
- The release form is integrated into the ChartRequest online workflow — not available as a standalone download
- No downloadable PDF form is provided through ChartRequest

### 5. Parent system (Mon Health)
- MHHS is an affiliate of Mon Health (Morgantown, WV)
- Mon Health Medical Center has a downloadable PDF authorization form
- The Mon Health form is specifically branded for "Mon Health Medical Center (MHMC)" — not for MHHS
- Downloaded as form-2.pdf for reference

- **File size**: 4,108,670 bytes

## Difficulties Encountered
- **No standalone downloadable ROI form exists** for Minnie Hamilton Health System
- MHHS has fully outsourced their medical records request process to ChartRequest, a third-party platform
- The ChartRequest platform requires account creation to access any forms — the authorization form is embedded in the online workflow
- The MHHS website has no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section
- The Mon Health authorization form (form-2.pdf) is specifically branded for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — it is NOT the form used by MHHS

## Summary
Minnie Hamilton Health System does not publish a downloadable ROI/authorization form on their website. They direct all medical records requests through ChartRequest (https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville), where the release form is part of the electronic workflow. The only related downloadable form found was from their affiliate system, Mon Health Medical Center, which is a separate facility in Morgantown, WV.

- **Note:** The original .doc file is preserved as form-1.doc.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://storage.googleapis.com/cardsetter-tmp-user-assets/fallon-medical/health-information-management/FMCCAH-ReleaseofInformationVerbal%2001012021%20sls.pdf
- **Format:** PDF (1 page)
- **Description:** "Verbal Release of Information" — A companion form for authorizing verbal (phone) release of health information to specified individuals. Covers lab reports, x-ray/EKG, clinic visits, ER visits, observation stays, and inpatient stays. Limited to a one-year period. Explicitly notes it does not authorize release of copies (requires the separate form-1).

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://storage.googleapis.com/cardsetter-tmp-user-assets/fallon-medical/FMCCAH%20%20NoticeOfPrivacyPractices%2002.16.2026%20sls.pdf
- **Format:** PDF (3 pages)
- **Description:** "Notice of Privacy Practices" — Standard HIPAA notice describing how medical information may be used and disclosed, and patient rights regarding their health information. Not an ROI form, but a related compliance document.

## Difficulties
- The primary release form (form-1) is published as a .doc file rather than PDF. It was converted to PDF using LibreOffice for consistency with the study format. The original .doc is also retained.
- No difficulties with access — all forms were publicly available without bot blocking or login walls.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The forms were found within 2 searches and were directly linked from the organization's Information Management page.

# Yale New Haven Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Yale New Haven Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately found the official fillable PDF on the parent system (Yale New Haven Health System / YNHHS) website.
2. **Web search** for "site:ynhhs.org request medical records release of information form" — confirmed the main form and discovered a separate form for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital (another YNHHS facility).

The forms were easy to find. The parent system website (ynhhs.org) has a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page with direct links to downloadable PDFs.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.ynhhs.org/-/media/files/ynhhs/pdf/medical-records/f4918eng_fillable_0719.pdf?la=en&hash=044B8954FB6FFD5078F8000BCF196B6DACA3FE8A
- **Document title**: "Authorization for Access/Release of Information"
- **Description**: The primary YNHHS ROI form (Form F4918Eng, dated 07/19). Covers Yale New Haven Hospital (York Street & St. Raphael's campuses), Bridgeport Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, NEMG, and Yale Medicine. 2 pages, fillable PDF with text layer. Includes options for MyChart delivery, mail, fax, secure email, and pick-up. Allows selecting specific record types (abstract, H&P, labs, radiology, etc.) and date ranges. Has checkboxes for sensitive information categories (HIV, substance abuse, psychiatric, genetic, STD).
- **File size**: ~565 KB

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.ynhhs.org/-/media/Files/YNHHS/PDF/medical-records/LH000013_Release_of_Information_Form_Fillable_031924.ashx
- **Document title**: "Authorization for Release of Information"
- **Description**: A separate ROI form for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital (also part of YNHHS). Fillable PDF, 2 pages. Similar structure to form-1 but specific to L+M Hospital. Offers MyChart, mail, fax, secure email, and pick-up delivery. Dated 03/19/24. Includes CD-ROM format option.
- **File size**: ~1.1 MB

## Difficulties

- **None significant.** Both forms were directly linked from the YNHHS "Request Medical Records" page and downloaded without any bot blocking or access issues.
- The forms are hosted on the parent system website (ynhhs.org) rather than the individual hospital site (ynhh.org), which makes sense given YNHH is part of the larger Yale New Haven Health System.

## Key Observations

- Yale New Haven Hospital uses a system-wide authorization form that covers multiple YNHHS facilities
- The form is fillable (interactive PDF fields) and offers electronic delivery via MyChart
- Lawrence + Memorial Hospital has its own separate form, suggesting some facility-level variation within the system
- Contact for submission: releaseofinfo-Hosp@ynhh.org, fax 203-688-4645, or mail to PO Box 9565, New Haven, CT 06535
- Routine requests processed within 10 business days

# St. Charles Redmond — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** St. Charles Redmond
- **Website:** https://stcharleshealthcare.org/locations/st-charles-redmond
- **Parent System:** St. Charles Health System (regional system, 4 hospitals in Central Oregon)
- **Location:** Redmond, OR

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `St. Charles Redmond Oregon "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately surfaced the St. Charles Health System release of information page and direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for `St. Charles Health System Oregon "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same page and additional older PDF URLs.
3. **Web search** for `site:stcharleshealthcare.org authorization release medical records` — provided further confirmation and additional form versions.
4. **Direct navigation** to https://stcharleshealthcare.org/patients/release-information — found the canonical release of information page with the currently-linked 2025 forms.

The form was easy to find. The release of information page is clearly linked and provides both English and Spanish versions of the authorization form. St. Charles uses a single ROI form across the entire health system (covering Bend, Redmond, Madras, and Prineville hospitals).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://stcharleshealthcare.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/ROIAuthorizationForm_42816_ENGLISH.pdf
- **File size:** 192,017 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** Older version of the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. Appears to be from an earlier revision cycle (filename references 4/28/16). Has text layer. This is a legacy version no longer linked from the current website.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://stcharleshealthcare.org/sites/default/files/Documents/ROI/3740AuthorizedRecordReleaseFILLABLE-102022.pdf
- **File size:** 379,816 bytes
- **Pages:** 2 (estimated)
- **Description:** 2022 fillable version of the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. Lists all St. Charles locations including Redmond. Has text layer and fillable form fields.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://stcharleshealthcare.org/sites/default/files/Documents/ROI/AuthorizationUseDisclosurePHI(ROI)-English%203740_2025-fillable.pdf
- **File size:** 335,801 bytes
- **Pages:** 2 (estimated)
- **Description:** **Current 2025 English version** of the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. This is the form currently linked from the release of information page. Fillable, lists all St. Charles locations including Redmond, Center for Orthopedics and Neurosurgery. Includes a note that faxes over 30 pages will be mailed.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://stcharleshealthcare.org/sites/default/files/Documents/ROI/AuthorizationUseDisclosurePHI%20(ROI)%20-%20Spanish2025-fillable.pdf
- **File size:** 344,105 bytes
- **Pages:** 2 (estimated)
- **Description:** **Current 2025 Spanish version** of the same authorization form. Equivalent content to form-3.pdf in Spanish.

## Difficulties
- None significant. One older URL (from 2020) returned a 404, but the current forms downloaded without issues.
- St. Charles does not have a Redmond-specific ROI form — the system-wide form covers all locations with checkboxes for each hospital.

## Key Observations
- St. Charles provides a unified ROI form across all hospital locations in the system.
- The form is available in both English and Spanish.
- Forms are described as "fillable" in their filenames, indicating interactive PDF fields.
- Patients can also request records via MyChart (patient portal) for records from April 7, 2018 onward.
- The release of information page is well-organized with clear instructions for self-requests and third-party requests.

# Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital
- **Location:** Miller, SD
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, part of Avera Health regional system (nonprofit)
- **Website:** https://www.avera.org/locations/profile/avera-hand-county-memorial-hospital/

## Search Strategies

### What was tried
1. **Web search for facility-specific form:** Searched for "Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital authorization release health information filetype:pdf" — no facility-specific form found.
2. **Web search for parent system (Avera) form:** Searched for "Avera medical records release form authorization PDF" — found multiple Avera system-level forms.
3. **Site-scoped search:** Searched "site:avera.org authorization release medical records form" — found the main Avera medical records request page.
4. **Navigated Avera medical records page:** https://www.avera.org/patients-visitors/patient-information/request-medical-records/ — found the primary HIPAA Authorization form and several facility-specific variants (for Heart Hospital, Access Health Worthington, Windom, Spencer, Lakes Regional, Osceola). No Hand County–specific form was listed.
5. **Checked facility profile page:** The Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital profile page has no direct link to an ROI form — patients would use the system-wide form.

### What worked
The parent system's medical records page (Avera Health) provides the general ROI form applicable to all Avera facilities, including Hand County Memorial Hospital. The form was found via web search and confirmed by navigating the Avera website.

## Difficulties
- **Bot blocking:** Avera's website blocks curl/wget requests entirely (returns "Access Denied" HTML). All PDF downloads had to be performed through the browser (Chrome DevTools), fetching the file via JavaScript `fetch()`, extracting base64, and decoding locally.
- **No facility-specific form:** Hand County Memorial Hospital does not have its own ROI form. The Avera system provides a single unified form used across most facilities, with a few exceptions (Heart Hospital, Worthington, Windom, Spencer, Lakes Regional, Osceola).

# Hendrick Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Hendrick Health Abilene TX "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately surfaced the Medical Records page and direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for `Hendrick Health "medical records" "release form" Abilene Texas` — confirmed two separate PDF forms (one for the hospital, one for the clinic).

No need to navigate the website directly or use browser automation — the forms were easily discoverable via web search and had direct, stable PDF URLs.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.hendrickhealth.org/documents/ROI-Form-Hendrick-Health-2024.pdf
- **File size:** 341,642 bytes
- **Document type:** Authorization to Release Health Information (ROI form) — Hendrick Health (hospital system)
- **Description:** 2024 version of the hospital's ROI form. "AUTHORIZATION TO OBTAIN PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI)". Includes patient info fields, record type checkboxes (H&P, meds, discharge summary, billing, radiology, etc.), delivery method options (personal pickup, mail, fax, email), reason for disclosure, and sensitive record categories requiring initials (mental health, substance abuse, genetic info, HIV/AIDS). References facility codes HMC/HMCB/HMCS. Has a text layer. Appears to be a flat (non-fillable) PDF.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.hendrickhealth.org/documents/hendrick%20clinic/Hendrick-Clinic-Authorization-to-Obtain-or-Release-PHI.pdf
- **File size:** 83,670 bytes
- **Document type:** Authorization to Obtain or Release PHI — Hendrick Clinic
- **Description:** Separate ROI form for the clinic arm of the system. Very similar structure and content to form-1 but specific to Hendrick Clinic. Single-page form with patient info, record type checkboxes, delivery options, reason for disclosure, and sensitive record categories requiring initials. Has a text layer. Appears to be a flat (non-fillable) PDF.

## Difficulties

- **None.** Both forms were readily available as direct PDF downloads from the Hendrick Health website. The Medical Records page (https://www.hendrickhealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/) links to both forms with clear descriptions.

## Summary

Hendrick Health provides two separate ROI forms — one for the hospital (Hendrick Medical Center) and one for the clinic (Hendrick Clinic). Both are downloadable PDFs with text layers. The forms are similar in structure but tailored to their respective entities. Retrieval was straightforward.

# Lexington Clinic — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Lexington Clinic
- **Website:** https://lexingtonclinic.com
- **Location:** Lexington, KY
- **Type:** Independent physician practice (for-profit)

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search** for `Lexington Clinic Lexington KY "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links and the patient forms page.
2. **Site-scoped search** for `site:lexingtonclinic.com authorization release medical records` — confirmed the same URLs.

The forms were very easy to find. The web search returned direct PDF download links on the first try, and the patient forms page (https://lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms) clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://lexingtonclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ROI-Auth-Updated-2024_May23-update.pdf
- **File size:** 136,313 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization for the Release of Medical Records — Lexington Clinic/Vital Chart" — this is the current (2024-updated) ROI form. It includes sections for patient info, delivery options (mail, email, fax), record type selection (specific providers, date ranges, conditions), and signature. References VitalChart as the ROI processing partner. Has text layer (fillable or at least extractable text).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://lexingtonclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2014_AuthorizationToReleaseMedicalInfoForm.pdf
- **File size:** 37,913 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information — Lexington Clinic and Lexington Clinic Associate Practices" — this is an older (2014-era) version of the ROI form.

## Difficulties
- None. Both forms were publicly accessible with direct download links. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering required. curl worked on the first attempt for both.

## Summary
Lexington Clinic makes their ROI form readily available. They have both a current 2024 version (processed via VitalChart) and an older 2014 version still hosted on their site. The current form is linked from their Patient Forms page. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

# Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital
- **Location:** Murfreesboro, TN
- **Website:** https://healthcare.ascension.org/locations/tennessee/tnnas/murfreesboro-ascension-saint-thomas-rutherford-hospital
- **Parent System:** Ascension (major nonprofit health system)

## Search Strategies

### What I tried
1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `"Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return a direct hit.
2. **Web search for medical records release form**: Searched for `"Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — **found direct link** to the Authorization for Disclosure of PHI PDF on Ascension's website.
3. **Site-scoped search**: Searched `site:healthcare.ascension.org authorization release medical records` — returned general Ascension results with links to forms from various markets (Illinois, Texas, Florida, etc.).
4. **Patient portal page**: Navigated to https://healthcare.ascension.org/patient-portal/tennessee-ascension-saint-thomas — found the "Medical records request" section which links to an online Swellbox-based records request wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/ascension-stthomas-wizard.html) rather than a downloadable form.
5. **Searched for patient-specific access form**: Searched for Ascension Saint Thomas "request my records" or "patient access" form PDF — no separate patient access form found; the Authorization for Disclosure of PHI is the single form used.

### What worked
The second web search directly returned a citation to the PDF URL on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://healthcare.ascension.org/-/media/project/ascension/healthcare/legacy/markets/tennessee/st-thomas/documents/sths409-authorization-for-disclosure-of-phi-1.pdf
- **File size:** 744,156 bytes (744 KB)
- **Pages:** 1
- **Document type:** Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)
- **Description:** A single-page authorization form covering all Ascension Saint Thomas facilities (DeKalb, Hickman, River Park, Rutherford, Medical Partners, Highlands, Stones River, Midtown, West). The form includes checkboxes for selecting the facility, fields for patient name/SSN/DOB/phone, recipient information, purpose of disclosure, type and date range of records, and signature. It explicitly lists Saint Thomas Rutherford with its HIM department phone number (615-396-4130). The form has a text layer (not a scan) and mentions options for mail or email delivery. Form number STHS490, revised 02/04/20.
- **Initial impression:** This is a general ROI/authorization form — it handles both patient access and third-party release in one form. It's not specifically a "patient access" form but rather a general authorization for disclosure.

## Additional Notes
- The Ascension Saint Thomas patient portal page offers an online medical records request through Swellbox (a third-party vendor), which is a web-based wizard rather than a downloadable PDF form.
- No separate patient-specific "right of access" form was found — the single Authorization for Disclosure of PHI form serves all purposes.
- The form is hosted on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure (`-/media/project/ascension/healthcare/legacy/markets/tennessee/`), suggesting it predates Ascension's current website architecture.
- The form is relatively large (744 KB) for a single-page document, likely due to embedded images/logos.

## Difficulties
- No significant difficulties. The form was found via a direct web search on the second query. The PDF downloaded without issues (no bot blocking or JavaScript requirements).

# Gritman Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Gritman Medical Center
- **Location**: Moscow, ID
- **Website**: https://www.gritman.org
- **Type**: Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Gritman Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return a direct hit.
2. **Web search** for `Gritman Medical Center "medical records" "release form" OR "authorization form"` — returned the direct PDF URL and the medical records page.
3. **Website navigation**: The form is linked from the "My Health Records" page at https://www.gritman.org/patients-visitors/my-health-records/ under the "Requesting Your Medical Records" section.

## Downloads

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.gritman.org/wp-content/uploads/Authorization-to-Release-Protected-Health-Information_clinics.pdf
- **File size**: 252,109 bytes
- **Document type**: Authorization to Release Protected Health Information (ROI form)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Single-page ROI form with fields for patient information, release-to/release-from parties, delivery method (standard mail, fax, email, pickup, certified mail), purpose (continuation of care, personal, legal, insurance, other), treatment dates, and information types to disclose (billing record, discharge summary, immunization record, ED reports, cardiac studies, laboratory, pertinent info, radiology reports, and more). Includes an "I Understand That" section with authorization language and a 90-day auto-expiration clause. Revised 4/1/2024.

## Difficulties

- **Bot blocking on direct curl download**: The initial `curl` attempt to download the PDF returned HTML instead of the actual PDF file. The server appears to require a browser-like session or cookies. Successfully downloaded via Chrome DevTools browser environment by fetching the PDF content from within the page context and base64-decoding it.

## Summary

The form was easy to find — directly linked from the medical records page (2 clicks from homepage: Patients & Visitors → My Health Records). Gritman provides a single general-purpose ROI form covering both patient access and third-party release scenarios. The form is a fillable PDF (version 1.6) with a text layer.

# East Georgia Healthcare Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** East Georgia Healthcare Center (EGHC)
- **Website:** https://eghc.org/
- **Location:** Swainsboro, GA
- **Type:** FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for direct PDF links:** Searched for `"East Georgia Healthcare Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` and `"East Georgia Healthcare Center" "medical records" "release form" PDF`. Found references to old PDF URLs at `eghc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Medical-Records-Release.pdf` and a Spanish version, but these URLs now return 404 (page not found).

2. **Site search:** Searched `site:eghc.org authorization release medical records`. Results confirmed the forms page at https://eghc.org/forms/ is the main hub.

3. **Direct website navigation:** Navigated to https://eghc.org/forms/. Found the forms page lists several patient forms. The Medical Records Release forms (English and Spanish) are now hosted on **RightSignature** (an e-signature platform at secure.rightsignature.com) rather than as direct PDF downloads. The old WordPress-hosted PDFs have been removed.

## What Was Found

EGHC's forms page (https://eghc.org/forms/) contains:
- Child Demographic forms (English/Spanish) — via RightSignature
- Adult Demographic forms (English/Spanish) — via RightSignature
- **Medical Records Release forms (English/Spanish) — via RightSignature**
- Sliding Scale Packet (English/Spanish) — via RightSignature
- Notice of Privacy Practice (English/Spanish) — direct PDF downloads

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://secure.rightsignature.com/templates/280e0c9b-58a0-4965-a8f2-ada6269d8b00/template-signer-link/5be1e11e4a02b05742f2b4c6340bbe24
- **Original format:** RightSignature interactive e-signature form; underlying document image extracted from S3 and converted PNG→PDF
- **Description:** Medical Records Release form (English). Single page. Titled "Medical Records Release" with EGHC letterhead. The form is oriented toward **incoming records** — it authorizes release of records FROM other providers TO EGHC ("I hereby request copies of all [my] health history and medical care released to: EAST GEORGIA HEALTHCARE CENTER, 215 NORTH COLEMAN STREET, SWAINSBORO, GA 30401"). Includes checkboxes for record types (All Medical Records, HIV Records, Hospital Records, Immunization Records, Lab Data, X-ray Reports, etc.), options for one-time release vs. coordination of care, and standard HIPAA authorization language.
- **Text layer:** No (image-only, converted from PNG)
- **Fillable fields:** The RightSignature version has interactive fields, but the captured PDF does not

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://secure.rightsignature.com/templates/93fb2d59-3fbd-40cf-b250-d54294d83270/template-signer-link/3ce2efc060c8a2c6b15bf53ebdc97574
- **Original format:** RightSignature interactive e-signature form; underlying document image extracted from S3 and converted PNG→PDF
- **Description:** Formulario de Autorización Médica / Medical Records Release form (Spanish). Single page. Spanish-language version of form-1. Titled "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA EL USO Y DIVULGACIÓN DE SU INFORMACIÓN DE SALUD PROTEGIDA."
- **Text layer:** No (image-only, converted from PNG)
- **Fillable fields:** The RightSignature version has interactive fields, but the captured PDF does not

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://eghc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EGHC-Notice-of-Privacy.pdf
- **Original format:** Direct PDF download from EGHC website
- **Description:** Notice of Privacy Practices. Multi-page document describing how EGHC uses and discloses medical information. This is NOT an ROI form — it's the HIPAA-required privacy notice.
- **Text layer:** Yes (full text extractable)
- **Fillable fields:** None (informational document)

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **Old PDF links are broken:** The 2019-era WordPress-hosted PDF URLs (e.g., `/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Medical-Records-Release.pdf`) now return 404 pages. Web search results still reference these dead links.

2. **Forms behind RightSignature:** The medical records release forms are now hosted on RightSignature's e-signature platform, which requires entering name and email to interact with the form. The underlying document is rendered as a PNG image, not a downloadable PDF. To capture the form, I had to:
   - Navigate to the RightSignature URL in a browser
   - Extract the S3-hosted document image URL from the page's DOM
   - Download the PNG image
   - Convert PNG to PDF using ImageMagick

3. **No patient-access-specific form:** The Medical Records Release form is oriented toward incoming records (from other providers to EGHC), not outgoing records (patient requesting their own records from EGHC). No separate form for patient access requests was found on the website.

4. **Image-only capture:** Because the forms were captured as rendered PNG images from the RightSignature platform, the resulting PDFs have no text layer and no fillable fields, even though the original RightSignature forms did have interactive fields.

# GI Alliance — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** GI Alliance
- **Website:** https://gialliance.com
- **Location:** Southlake, TX
- **Type:** Physician practice, for-profit, major system affiliation, South census region

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release forms with filetype:pdf** — The first search did not return direct PDF links but confirmed the organization uses such forms. The second search returned links to affiliate practice forms (University GI, GI Associates).
2. **Site-specific search on gialliance.com** — Successfully found the main GI Alliance authorization form hosted directly at `gialliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/authorization-health-form.pdf`.
3. **Additional web search for patient forms pages** — Confirmed the main form URL and also found a HealthMark Group digital portal reference and affiliate-specific forms.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://gialliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/authorization-health-form.pdf
- **File size:** 96,670 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Initial impression:** This is the primary GI Alliance "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" form. It is a text-based PDF created in Microsoft Word (not a scan). It includes fields for patient name, birth date, recipient info, record type selection (all records or specific types), sensitive information categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance use, genetic info), purpose, authorization duration (1 year), revocation instructions, and signature. It is a general-purpose ROI form — not specifically a patient-access form, but usable for patient requests (has a "at Patient's request" purpose checkbox). No fillable form fields (flat PDF).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.granitepeaksgi.com/wp-content/uploads/Release-of-Records-GI-Alliance.pdf
- **File size:** 256,151 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Initial impression:** This is a GI Alliance-branded "Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party" form from Granite Peaks GI (a GI Alliance affiliate). It is an image-only scan (no extractable text layer). The pdftotext output is garbled OCR artifacts. Created with PDFCreator/Ghostscript in January 2025. Being a 2-page scanned form, it likely contains more detailed release instructions but is not digitally accessible.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.universitygi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Medical-Release-Form.pdf
- **File size:** 301,396 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Initial impression:** This is a scanned medical release form from University GI (a GI Alliance affiliate). Title metadata says "Scanned Image" and it was created with NAPS2 scanning software. Image-only PDF with no text layer. It contains a single full-page scan of a medical release form.

## Difficulties
- The main gialliance.com form (form-1) was relatively easy to find — directly linked from the website's uploads directory and surfaced by web search.
- Affiliate practices (Granite Peaks GI, University GI) have their own versions of the form, but these are image-only scans rather than text-based PDFs.
- No forms appeared to be behind a login wall or patient portal.
- The GI Alliance patient forms page (gialliance.com/patient-forms-and-prep/) exists but is organized by local brand/location, making it somewhat complex to navigate.

## Summary
Found 3 forms total: 1 text-based authorization form from the main GI Alliance website, and 2 image-only scanned forms from affiliate practices. The primary form (form-1.pdf) is the canonical GI Alliance ROI/authorization form. Retrieval difficulty: **easy** for the main form.

# West Tennessee Healthcare — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `West Tennessee Healthcare "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form` — immediately returned direct PDF links and the medical records page URL.
2. **Site-scoped search** for `site:wth.org authorization release medical records form` — confirmed the same results.
3. **Website navigation** — visited https://www.wth.org/request-medical-records/ to confirm all available forms and understand context.

The first web search was sufficient; the forms were easy to find.

## Forms Downloaded

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.wth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Medical_Release_Authorization.pdf
- **Document title:** "MEDICAL RELEASE AUTHORIZATION"
- **Description:** Allows a physician/provider/nurse or staff to discuss care or selected items with appointed individuals. Appears to be an older (2019) version of a general medical release form, specifically for West Tennessee Medical Group Clinics. Includes checkboxes for types of records to release (lab, radiology, discharge summary, etc.). Single page, has text layer.
- **File size:** 124,077 bytes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.wth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AUTH-2020.pdf
- **Document title:** "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION"
- **Description:** Third-party release authorization form (2020 version). Used when someone other than the patient initiates a records request (e.g., attorney). Includes method of disclosure options (paper, fax, CD/DVD, email with encrypted/unencrypted options), record type selection, and HIPAA-related language. Has text layer.
- **File size:** 23,126 bytes

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.wth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ACCESS-REQUEST-2020.pdf

Explicitly noted as "to be used when patient wants to access their own medical record or allow a personal representative to do so." Includes method of disclosure options (paper, fax, CD/DVD, portal, email with encrypted/unencrypted options). This is the most relevant form for HIPAA Right of Access purposes. Has text layer.
- **File size:** 22,991 bytes

## Additional Notes

- The medical records page (https://www.wth.org/request-medical-records/) also links to Spanish versions of form-2 and form-3, and an online request portal via ScanStat (https://www.scanstat.com/patient-record-request/) for hospital records only.
- West Tennessee Healthcare distinguishes between patient access (form-3) and third-party release (form-2), which is a good practice.
- Form-1 appears to be an older/separate form specific to the medical group clinics.
- All three forms have extractable text layers (not image-only scans).
- Retrieval difficulty: **easy** — forms were directly linked from a clearly labeled medical records page.

# A.O. Fox Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: A.O. Fox Hospital
- **Location**: Oneonta, NY
- **Parent System**: Bassett Healthcare Network
- **Website**: https://www.bassett.org

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search for A.O. Fox Hospital authorization form**: Searched for `A.O. Fox Hospital Oneonta NY "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`. No direct results for a Fox-specific form.
2. **Web search for Bassett Healthcare Network form**: Searched for `Bassett Healthcare Network "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF`. This immediately returned a direct link to the Bassett Healthcare Network's authorization form PDF, which covers all Bassett facilities including A.O. Fox Hospital.

The parent system search was the successful strategy. A.O. Fox Hospital uses the Bassett Healthcare Network system-wide form.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.bassett.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/Authorization-for-Medical-Records-Release-eform-2025.pdf
- **File size**: 240,401 bytes (235 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **PDF version**: 1.6
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Form fields**: Yes (AcroForm — fillable PDF)
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization for Medical Record Release
- **Initial impression**: This is a comprehensive, network-wide authorization form for medical record release used across all Bassett Healthcare Network facilities. The form header lists A.O. Fox Hospital (Oneonta, NY) as one of five facilities with checkboxes. It includes sections for patient information, recipient details, verbal communication authorization, disclosure format options (including MyBassett Portal), record type selection, purpose of disclosure, and signature. The form references 42 CFR Part 2 protections and includes detailed language about HIV/AIDS information, mental health, and substance abuse records. It was created with Acrobat PDFMaker and appears to be a digital-first fillable form.

## Difficulties
- None. The form was easy to find via web search for the parent health system (Bassett Healthcare Network). The direct PDF URL was returned in search results.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy

# Natividad Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Natividad Medical Center
- **Location**: Salinas, CA
- **Website**: https://www.natividad.com
- **Type**: Community hospital, independent, government-owned

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `"Natividad Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — initial search was not productive.
2. **Web search for medical records release form**: Searched for `"Natividad Medical Center" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found both PDF forms directly.
3. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:natividad.com authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records page at https://www.natividad.com/medical-records/ and both PDF links.

**What worked**: The second web search immediately surfaced both PDF download URLs from the Natividad website.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.natividad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Auth-to-Release-Health-Info_English.pdf
- **File size**: 53,245 bytes
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Authorization to Release Health Information (English). This is an image-only scan (grayscale CCITT-compressed, 1704×2200 pixels at 200 DPI). Created with Calibre in 2019. No text layer — pdftotext produces no output. No fillable fields. Appears to be a newer version of the ROI form but stored as a scanned image.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.natividad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Auth_ROI_e.pdf
- **File size**: 26,523 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Description**: "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" — Natividad Medical Center. This is a text-based PDF (created from Microsoft Word via Acrobat Distiller in 2007). Has full text layer but no fillable form fields. Covers standard ROI elements: patient info, recipient info, scope of records, special categories (mental health, HIV, substance abuse), purpose, expiration, patient rights, and revocation. The form is encrypted (copy-protected but printable).

## Difficulties
- Form-1 is an image-only scan with no text layer, making it less accessible.
- Form-2 is copy-protected (encrypted with RC4, copy disabled).
- Neither form has fillable fields — both must be printed and filled by hand.
- The forms appear to be two different versions/generations of the same authorization form, both still hosted on the website.
- No Spanish version was found as a direct PDF link, though the Spanish medical records page exists.

# La Clínica de La Raza — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: La Clínica de La Raza
- **Website**: https://laclinica.org
- **Location**: Oakland, CA (multiple locations in East Bay)
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web searches (multiple queries)
- `"La Clínica de La Raza" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf`
- `"La Clínica de La Raza" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`
- `site:laclinica.org authorization release medical records`
- `"La Clinica de La Raza" OR laclinica.org "release of information" form PDF Oakland`
- `laclinica.org filetype:pdf`
- `"La Clinica de La Raza" HIPAA "right of access" request records form`

**Result**: Web searches consistently returned forms from **laclinicahealth.org**, which is a *different organization* — La Clinica Health Centers in Medford, Oregon. Search engines frequently confused the two similarly-named organizations. No ROI form was found hosted on laclinica.org.

### 2. Website navigation (browser)
- Navigated to https://laclinica.org/patient-information/ — no medical records or ROI form link
- Checked "Rights and Responsibilities" page — general patient rights, no forms
- Checked "Notice of Privacy Practices" page — links to NPP PDFs (English, Spanish, Chinese)
- No "Medical Records", "Forms", or "Release of Information" section exists on the website

### 3. URL guessing
Tried common PDF URL patterns on laclinica.org/wp-content/uploads/:
- authorization-release-information.pdf, release-of-information.pdf, Authorization-to-Release-Information.pdf, etc.
- All returned 404

### 4. Other strategies
- Checked laclinica.projectahost.com — confirmed this is La Clinica Health (Oregon), not La Clínica de La Raza
- Searched for OCHIN-standard ROI forms (La Clínica uses OCHIN's MyChart) — OCHIN doesn't publish standard forms
- Checked Wayback Machine — no ROI forms found in archived pages

## Findings

**La Clínica de La Raza does NOT publish an ROI form on their public website.**

Their Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3.pdf) instructs patients to request records by writing to:
> La Clínica de La Raza, Inc.  
> Attention: Privacy Officer  
> P.O. Box 22210, Oakland, CA 94623

The NPP confirms the right to access/copy PHI and mentions the right to receive PHI in electronic format, but provides no downloadable authorization form.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://laclinicahealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Authorization-to-Release-Information-english.pdf
- **What it is**: Authorization to Release/Disclose Information (2015 Revision)
- **Organization**: ⚠️ **WRONG ORGANIZATION** — La Clinica del Valle, Medford, OR 97501 (not La Clínica de La Raza, Oakland, CA)
- **Notes**: Found via web search that confused the two similarly-named organizations. The form explicitly references "La Clinica del Valle at 3617 S. Pacific Hwy., Medford, OR 97501."

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://laclinicahealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Release-of-Information-0822-English.pdf
- **What it is**: Authorization to Release Information (August 2022 revision)
- **Organization**: ⚠️ **WRONG ORGANIZATION** — La Clinica Health Centers, Oregon (marked "OR PCD" at top)
- **Notes**: Also from laclinicahealth.org (Oregon). Updated version of their ROI form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://laclinica.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LC_8092-Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-English.pdf
- **What it is**: Notice of Privacy Practices (FORM 8092, 10/12 revision)
- **Organization**: ✅ La Clínica de La Raza, Inc., Oakland, CA (correct organization)
- **Notes**: Not an ROI form, but the only patient-facing privacy/records document published online by this organization. Contains the process description for requesting records.

## Difficulties
1. **Name confusion**: Two unrelated organizations share the "La Clinica" name — La Clínica de La Raza (Oakland, CA, laclinica.org) and La Clinica Health Centers (Medford, OR, laclinicahealth.org). Search engines consistently conflate them.
2. **No online form**: La Clínica de La Raza appears to handle medical records requests only in-person or by mail, with no downloadable ROI form on their website.
3. **Minimal web presence for patient forms**: The laclinica.org website has limited patient-facing documents — only the Notice of Privacy Practices, Rights and Responsibilities, and a sliding fee matrix are published as PDFs.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard / No form found online
The organization does not appear to make their ROI form available for download on their public website. Patients likely need to call (510-535-4000) or visit a clinic location to obtain the form.

# Duly Health and Care — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Duly Health and Care
- **Location**: Downers Grove, IL
- **Website**: https://www.dulyhealthandcare.com
- **Type**: Physician practice, independent, for-profit, Midwest

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Duly Health and Care authorization release health information filetype:pdf"** — No direct PDF links in results.
2. **Web search for "Duly Health and Care medical records release form filetype:pdf"** — Found multiple PDF URLs including Duly's own form hosted on Azure blob storage and MediCopy partner forms. This was the most productive search.
3. **Web search for "site:dulyhealthandcare.com authorization release medical records"** — Confirmed the medical records request page at dulyhealthandcare.com/services/medical-records-requests and surfaced additional form URLs.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://dmgwebprodstorage.blob.core.windows.net/dmgprodweb/files/@assetBasePath/files/Release-of-Information-Authorization-Updated-062023.pdf
- **File size**: 214,315 bytes
- **Description**: Duly Health and Care's own "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, processed by ScanSTAT Technologies. Contains sections for patient info, information requested (radiology, cardiac, labs, progress notes, etc.), recipient, delivery method (fax, mail, MyChart, secure e-delivery, pick up), purpose of disclosure, and signature. References 45 CFR § 171.204(a)(2) regarding sensitive information segmentation. Updated June 2023. This is the primary ROI form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://medicopy.net/sites/default/files/2025-01/Duly%20and%20MediCopy%20Authorization.pdf
- **File size**: 231,731 bytes
- **Description**: MediCopy "Authorization for the Release of Medical Records" — a multi-facility form that covers Duly Health and Care, The South Bend Clinic, and Quincy Medical Group. This is a partner/vendor form for releasing records through MediCopy's service.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://dmgwebprodstorage.blob.core.windows.net/dmgprodweb/files/%40assetBasePath/files/Duly-MediCopy-MRO-Intake-Form-Authorization.pdf
- **File size**: 81,363 bytes
- **Description**: MediCopy Disability/FMLA Intake Form and Authorization. Not a standard ROI form — this is specifically for disability/FMLA paperwork requests. Includes authorization for release of records needed for form completion.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://dmgwebprodstorage.blob.core.windows.net/dmgprodweb/files/%40assetBasePath/files/Duly-MRO-MediCopy-Authorization.pdf
- **File size**: 239,671 bytes
- **Description**: Another MediCopy "Authorization for the Release of Medical Records" form. Generic version with facility name fields (not pre-filled for specific organizations). Similar structure to form-2 but appears to be a more general template.

## Difficulties
- None significant. Forms were readily discoverable via web search. Duly hosts forms on Azure blob storage (dmgwebprodstorage.blob.core.windows.net) — the "dmg" in the URL reflects their former name "DuPage Medical Group."
- The organization uses MediCopy/MRO as their third-party release of information vendor, which means multiple authorization forms exist (Duly's own and MediCopy's).
- All downloads succeeded on first attempt with no bot blocking.

## Summary
Retrieval difficulty: **easy**. Four forms found and downloaded. The primary ROI form is form-1.pdf (Duly's own authorization). Forms 2 and 4 are MediCopy partner authorization forms, and form-3 is a specialized FMLA/disability form.

# Olmsted Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Olmsted Medical Center
- **Website:** https://www.olmmed.org
- **Location:** Rochester, MN
- **Type:** Independent nonprofit physician practice

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Olmsted Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — returned direct PDF links and identified the "Manage Your Health Information" page.
2. **Web search** for `"Olmsted Medical Center" "medical records" "release form" Rochester MN` — confirmed the main ROI form URL and page location.
3. **Web search** for `site:olmmed.org authorization release medical records` — provided additional context and form URLs.
4. **Direct website navigation** to https://www.olmmed.org/patients-visitors/your-care-visit/manage/ — the main page listing all consent/authorization forms.

## Difficulties
- **Bot blocking (Akamai CDN):** Direct `curl` downloads were blocked with "Access Denied" responses. Had to use browser (Chrome DevTools) to fetch the PDFs and extract them via base64 encoding.
- Forms were easy to find on the website (Patients & Visitors > Your Care & Visit > Manage Your Health Information), clearly organized with multiple language options.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.olmmed.org/app/files/public/4c1a4ac3-ee2d-4c4e-9475-80528a070c34/Patients%20and%20Visitors/Consent%20-%20Authorization%20for%20Release%20of%20Health%20Information.pdf
- **File size:** 205,357 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization for Release of Health Information" — the primary ROI form. Includes fields for patient name, DOB, address, release from/to details, method of disclosure (mail, pick up, fax, patient portal), specific information to be released (clinic visit notes, operative reports, lab, radiology, immunizations, etc.), purpose of release, and authorization/signature section. This is the main form patients use to request their medical records.
- **Initial impression:** Standard ROI/authorization form — appears to be a fillable PDF (version 1.7 with AcroForm). Well-organized single-page form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.olmmed.org/app/files/public/6ac63789-b7eb-489d-b147-e62879400dd0/Patients%20and%20Visitors/Consent---Authorization-for-Allowing-Verbal-Communication-of-PHI.pdf
- **File size:** 105,001 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization for Allowing Verbal Communication of Protected Health Information" — a separate authorization form that permits OMC staff to verbally discuss a patient's health information with a designated person. Limited to verbal discussions only, does not permit release of written health information. Valid for one year or specified time period.
- **Initial impression:** Companion authorization form, not a traditional ROI form but related to health information disclosure. Narrower scope (verbal only).

## Other Forms Available (Not Downloaded)
The "Manage Your Health Information" page also lists:
- Spanish and Somali translations of both forms above
- "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Patient Health Information for Publicity Purposes" (English only)
- MyChart Adult Proxy Access and Authorization forms (on a separate proxy access page)

## Summary
Olmsted Medical Center makes their ROI forms readily available on a dedicated "Manage Your Health Information" page. The primary form (form-1.pdf) is the standard authorization for release of health information. The website is well-organized with clear navigation, and forms are offered in multiple languages. The main barrier was CDN-level bot blocking requiring browser-based download.

# Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — general results, no direct PDF links found.
2. **Web search** for `site:addabbo.org authorization release medical records` — successfully identified the Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`) and Patient Forms page (`/for-patients/patient-forms/`).
3. **Website navigation** — navigated directly to the Medical Records page and Patient Forms page to find form links.

## What Worked

The organization's website has a dedicated **Medical Records** page (`https://www.addabbo.org/for-patients/medical-records/`) with clear links to the HIPAA authorization form. There is also a **Patient Forms** page (`https://www.addabbo.org/for-patients/patient-forms/`) listing all patient registration forms including a separate HIPAA Consent form.

Forms are hosted on a third-party platform (`pbformsonline.com` / Practice Builders) using a custom JavaScript-based PDF viewer. Direct `curl` downloads of the viewer URLs return HTML, not PDFs. The actual PDF files are served from a different path (`/pdv-view-merge/pdfviewer/data/fed/...`) which was discovered by inspecting network requests in the browser.

## Difficulties

- **Third-party form hosting**: Forms are not hosted directly on addabbo.org but on `pbformsonline.com` via a JavaScript-rendered PDF viewer. This required using browser DevTools to inspect network traffic and find the actual PDF download URLs.
- **No direct PDF download links**: The website links to the viewer, not the raw PDF files.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.pbformsonline.com/pdv-view-merge/pdfviewer/data/fed/1566545098hipaa___fillable_form_07-10-18.pdf`
- **Linked from**: `https://www.addabbo.org/for-patients/medical-records/` (labeled "HIPAA-compliant request form")
- **What it is**: OCA Official Form No. 960 — "Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA" — approved by the New York State Department of Health. This is the primary ROI/authorization form used for requesting medical records. It is a fillable PDF with fields for patient info, provider info, recipient info, scope of records, sensitive information authorization (alcohol/drug treatment, mental health, HIV), reason for release, and expiration date.
- **File size**: 135,089 bytes

- **Linked from**: `https://www.addabbo.org/for-patients/medical-records/` (labeled "We're Listening form") and `https://www.addabbo.org/for-patients/patient-forms/`
- **What it is**: "We're Listening" form — a bilingual (English/Spanish) patient survey/transfer form. Asks patients why they are seeking a transfer from Addabbo, with checkboxes for seeking another provider, moving, or requesting records for personal needs. Not an ROI form per se, but related to the records transfer process.
- **File size**: 963,019 bytes

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.pbformsonline.com/pdv-view-merge/pdfviewer/data/fed/1563365959addabbo-hipaa-release-english.pdf`
- **Linked from**: `https://www.addabbo.org/for-patients/patient-forms/` (labeled "HIPAA Consent to Release Information — English")
- **What it is**: "HIPAA Consent to Release Information Form" — a consent form for use and disclosure of Protected Health Information and acknowledgment of receipt of Notice of Privacy Practices. This is a general consent form signed during patient registration, not a specific records request authorization. It authorizes routine use/disclosure of PHI as described in the Notice of Privacy Practices.
- **File size**: 395,328 bytes

## Summary

The primary ROI form is **form-1.pdf** (OCA Form 960), which is the New York State standard authorization form for release of health information. The organization uses this state-standard form rather than a custom one. It was found on the Medical Records page, which is easily accessible from the main navigation under "For Patients > Medical Records." The form is fillable and can be submitted online through the Practice Builders platform, faxed, mailed, or delivered in person.

# Nemaha Valley Community Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Nemaha Valley Community Hospital
- **Location**: Seneca, KS
- **Website**: https://nemvch.com
- **Type**: Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit, Midwest

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF**: Searched `"Nemaha Valley Community Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct results.
2. **Web search for release form**: Searched `"Nemaha Valley Community Hospital" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — no direct PDF link but pointed to the hospital website.
3. **Site-scoped search**: Searched `site:nemvch.com authorization release medical records` — this was the most effective. The AI search response identified the form on the Resources page and provided the direct URL.
4. **Website navigation**: Navigated to https://nemvch.com/resources/ — found the "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form linked under "Documents and Resources" section.

## What Worked
The site-scoped web search was most effective, quickly identifying the Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) as the location for the authorization form. The form was easy to find — listed clearly on the Resources page with a descriptive link title.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://nemvch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Authorization-for-Release.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Health Information (ROI form)
- **Pages**: 2
- **File size**: 268,656 bytes
- **Text layer**: No — image-only scan (two grayscale CCITT-encoded images at 300 DPI)
- **Notes**: This is the primary ROI form. It is a scanned paper form with no extractable text and no fillable fields. A Spanish version is also available on the site.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://nemvch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-021626.pdf
- **Document type**: Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)
- **Pages**: 12
- **File size**: ~large
- **Text layer**: Yes — full text extractable
- **Notes**: This is the hospital's HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, effective February 16, 2026. It describes patient rights including the right to access medical records. Not an ROI form itself, but a related compliance document that explains patient rights under HIPAA. Downloaded because it was referenced in search results and provides context for the ROI process.

## Difficulties
- The ROI form (form-1.pdf) is an image-only scan with no text layer, meaning it cannot be filled electronically and text cannot be extracted for analysis without OCR.
- The form was uploaded in October 2019 and appears to be an older scanned document.
- No issues with bot blocking or access restrictions — straightforward curl download worked.

## Additional Observations
- The hospital also offers a Spanish version of the authorization form at: https://nemvch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Release-of-information.-revision-2.2022-ES.pdf
- The Resources page is well-organized with clear document labels.
- The form was findable within 2 clicks from the homepage (Resources link in header → Authorization for Release of Health Information link).

# Adena Regional Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Adena Regional Medical Center
- **Website:** https://www.adena.org
- **Location:** Chillicothe, OH
- **Parent System:** Adena Health System

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Adena Regional Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return a direct PDF hit.
2. **Web search** for `"Adena Regional Medical Center" Chillicothe Ohio "medical records" "release form"` — found the medical records request page at `https://www.adena.org/patients-and-visitors/patient-rights/medical-records-request`.
3. **Web search** for `site:adena.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records request page and found a direct link to the PDF form.
4. **Navigated the medical records request page** — found two separate authorization form PDFs and a fee schedule PDF linked from the page.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.adena.org/docs/default-source/billing-and-financial/medical-release-form.pdf?sfvrsn=2caf85b8_0`
- **File size:** 131,031 bytes
- **Description:** "AUTHORIZATION: RELEASE OF INFORMATION FORM" (CLI.1777, Rev. 10/25). This appears to be the current/updated version of the ROI form. It is a text-based PDF with standard authorization fields including patient info, record types, purpose of disclosure, and signature areas. Notably includes an option to request records in electronic format via email.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.adena.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/authorization-for-roi-final---2020-09-02.pdf?sfvrsn=9e3ecc80_3`
- **File size:** 580,303 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization: Release of Information Form" — an older version of the ROI form (dated 2020-09-02 in the filename). Linked from the "Option 3 - By Mail or Fax" section of the medical records request page. Similar content to form-1 but slightly different layout and address (272 Hospital Road vs. 110 Vaughn Lane). Single page.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.adena.org/docs/default-source/billing-and-financial/2025-release-of-information-pay-schedule_adena-patient-letter.pdf?sfvrsn=176dbece_1`
- **File size:** 638,906 bytes
- **Description:** 2025 Release of Information fee schedule / patient letter. Image-only scan (no text layer, no embedded fonts). Linked from the top of the medical records request page under "Medical Records Fees."

## Difficulties
- None significant. The forms were straightforward to find via web search and were directly downloadable as PDFs without bot blocking or JavaScript rendering issues.
- The medical records page links two different versions of the authorization form — one from the billing/financial section (form-1, newer revision 10/25) and one from the default document library (form-2, dated 2020). It's unclear which one the organization considers current.
- The fee schedule (form-3) is an image-only scan with no text layer.

## Retrieval Difficulty
Easy — forms were found on the first search and downloadable directly.

# Rhode Island Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Rhode Island Hospital
- **Website**: https://www.brownhealth.org
- **Location**: Providence, RI
- **Parent System**: Brown University Health (formerly Lifespan)

## Search Strategy
1. Web search for `Rhode Island Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF` — immediately found the main system-wide authorization form and department-specific variants.
2. Web search for `site:brownhealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the main form URL and found the updated 2024 version, plus the medical records request page at https://www.brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.brownhealth.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/Authorization-Release-PHI-Brown-Health-10152024-V2.pdf
- **Description**: Main "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" form for Brown University Health system. Covers Rhode Island Hospital/Hasbro Children's, The Miriam Hospital, Newport Hospital, and Brown Health Medical Group. Updated October 2024 version.
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **File size**: ~186 KB
- **Initial impression**: This is the primary ROI form applicable to Rhode Island Hospital. It includes checkboxes for selecting which facility, fields for recipient, dates of treatment, purpose of disclosure, types of records, and signature/authorization sections with expiration terms.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.brownhealth.org/sites/default/files/2023-04/DI-Authorization-to-Release-Protected-Health-Information-FORM-approved-Medical-records-Cmt_11162020.pdf
- **Description**: Department-specific "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" form for Lifespan Medical Imaging. Covers release of imaging reports and CDs.
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **File size**: ~46 KB
- **Initial impression**: Specialized ROI form for medical imaging records (reports, CDs). Includes sensitive information exclusions (sexual abuse, mental health, STIs, HIV, substance use). Also lists method of release options (patient pickup, courier, mail, FedEx).

## Difficulties
- None. Forms were easily discoverable via web search and directly downloadable as PDFs without any bot blocking or login requirements.

## Additional Notes
- The system recently rebranded from "Lifespan" to "Brown University Health" / "Brown Health". The 2024 form reflects the new branding while the imaging form still uses "Lifespan" branding.
- A dedicated medical records page exists at https://www.brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records with instructions and contact information.
- There is also a Neuropsych-specific release form and a Brown Medicine (physician group) form, but those are for distinct affiliated entities rather than Rhode Island Hospital proper.

# King's Daughters Medical Center (Brookhaven, MS) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: King's Daughters Medical Center
- **Website**: https://www.kdmc.org
- **Location**: Brookhaven, MS 39601
- **Type**: Independent nonprofit community hospital

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web searches (multiple queries)
- `"King's Daughters Medical Center" Brookhaven MS authorization release health information form PDF`
- `site:kdmc.org authorization release medical records form`
- `"kdmc.org" medical records release form download Brookhaven Mississippi`
- `"King's Daughters Medical Center" Brookhaven "release of information" OR "authorization for release" filetype:pdf`
- `site:kdmc.org filetype:pdf`

**Result**: No ROI/authorization form PDF found. Multiple search engines consistently confirmed that no downloadable release of information form is publicly available on kdmc.org.

### 2. Website navigation
- Navigated to Patients & Visitors section
- Checked "Online Medical Record Request" page → redirects to Datavant/Swellbox online wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/kings-daughters-mc-wizard.html)
- Checked "My Patient Access" page → patient portal login only (myportal.kdmc.org)
- Checked "Notice of Privacy Practices" page → links to the NPP PDF
- Checked Admissions, Billing, Patient Rights pages
- Reviewed full site map at kdmc.org/site-map/
- Scanned all pages for PDF links

**Result**: The website does not link to any downloadable ROI form. Medical records requests are handled entirely through the Datavant/Swellbox online wizard.

### 3. PDF inventory on kdmc.org
Exhaustive search found these PDFs hosted on the domain:
- `KDMC-Joint-Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf` — Notice of Privacy Practices
- `KDMC-Occ-Health-Authorization-Form-Revised.pdf` — Employer/Occupational Health Authorization
- `KDMC-Financial-Assistance-Policy-Plain-Language-Summary.pdf` — Financial assistance
- `KDMC-Financial-Assistance-Policy.pdf` — Full financial assistance policy
- `Kings-Daughters-Medical-Center-2021-CHNA-Report.pdf` — Community Health Needs Assessment
- `KDMC-Prayer-Walk-Book-2025.pdf` — Prayer walk book

None of these are patient-facing ROI/authorization for release of health information forms.

### 4. Disambiguation note
Search results frequently confused this facility with **King's Daughters Health System** in Ashland, KY (kingsdaughtershealth.com), which is an entirely different organization. That Kentucky system does have a downloadable authorization form, but it is not related to this Brookhaven, MS facility.

## Medical Records Request Process
KDMC Brookhaven uses **Datavant (formerly Swellbox)** for medical records requests via an online wizard at:
- https://www.swellbox.com/kings-daughters-mc-wizard.html
- Cost: $6.50 flat fee + $0.12 per page
- Records fulfilled by Datavant; patient receives invoice from Datavant
- Requires photo ID for pickup
- Phone contact: 601-835-9276 (Datavant customer service) or 601-835-9282 (Health Information Records dept)

There is no downloadable PDF form — the process is entirely online through the Datavant wizard.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.kdmc.org/documents/KDMC-Joint-Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf
- **Document type**: Joint Notice of Privacy Practices (NOT an ROI form)
- **Description**: Standard HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices covering patient rights, organizational uses/disclosures, and complaint procedures. 1 page.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.kdmc.org/documents/KDMC-Occ-Health-Authorization-Form-Revised.pdf
- **Document type**: Employer/Occupational Health Authorization Form (NOT an ROI form)
- **Description**: Form for employers to authorize occupational health services (DOT physicals, pre-employment physicals, drug/alcohol testing, etc.) for their employees. Not a patient-facing medical records release form.

## Difficulties Encountered
1. **No ROI form available online**: KDMC Brookhaven does not publish a downloadable authorization for release of health information form. They have fully outsourced the records request process to Datavant's online wizard.
2. **Name confusion**: The name "King's Daughters Medical Center" / "KDMC" is shared with an entirely separate health system in Kentucky, which caused search engines to return irrelevant results from kingsdaughtershealth.com.
3. **Limited PDF resources**: The website has very few downloadable patient forms of any kind.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard
No ROI form exists as a downloadable PDF on the organization's website. The records request process is exclusively handled through a third-party online platform (Datavant/Swellbox).

# Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `"Mosaic Life Care" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` and similar queries. Initial results pointed to a .docx file on the site and several unrelated "Mosaic" organizations (Mosaic Health in NY, Mosaic Community Health in OR).

2. **Site-specific search**: `site:mymlc.com authorization release medical records` — found the Health Information Management page and a HIPAA Authorization Form page.

3. **Website navigation**: Navigated to the HIM page (`/Main/Service/health-information-management/`) which had an "Authorizations and Forms" section with direct links to:
   - Authorization For Release of Protected Health Information (PDF)
   - Restriction Request (web form)
   - Medical Records Amendment Request (web form)

4. **HIPAA Authorization Form page**: Found a second link under Privacy Policy > HIPAA Authorization Form (`/General/Privacy-Policy/HIPAA-Authorization-Form/`) pointing to a different PDF.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mymlc.com/contentassets/a22d8e2c70614860b8feea5e488cdd16/authorization-for-release-of-phi.pdf
- **Found on**: Health Information Management page → "Authorizations and Forms" section
- **File size**: 601,526 bytes (602 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request to Another Agency
- **Notes**: This appears to be the current/updated version of the ROI form. It lists specific Mosaic Life Care facilities (Medical Center - Albany, Maryville, Saint Joseph, LTACH). Form # 3014, dated 03.28.19. Includes multi-language notice section on page 2. Has text layer (not a scan). Mentions "Heartland Regional Medical Center" in the legal disclaimer text (the organization's former name). Includes options for types of records, date ranges, and purpose for release.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mymlc.com/contentassets/4fcfecbcab604b579303760a042cacf5/auth-from-hipaa3014.pdf
- **Found on**: HIPAA Authorization Form page (`/General/Privacy-Policy/HIPAA-Authorization-Form/`)
- **File size**: 90,539 bytes (91 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request from Mosaic Life Care to Another Agency
- **Notes**: Similar form to form-1 but appears to be an older or alternate version. Uses "Mosaic Life Care" as the facility name (not broken out by location). Smaller file size suggests different formatting/fewer embedded images. Also references "Heartland Regional Medical Center" in the legal fine print. Same form number (3014).

## Additional Observations

- Mosaic Life Care was formerly known as Heartland Health / Heartland Regional Medical Center; both form versions still reference this old name in legal disclaimers.
- The organization also provides a .docx version of the form at `https://www.mymlc.com/globalassets/authorization-for-release-of-information-3014-066-1.docx` — this is the oldest version still using "Heartland Health" branding throughout.
- Forms can be submitted via email to ROI@myMLC.com, or by mail/fax to the HIM office at 105 Far West Drive, Suite 202, St. Joseph, MO 64506.
- The site uses Epic MyChart for online patient record access.
- Both forms are general ROI/release-to-third-party forms, not specific to patient self-access under HIPAA Right of Access.

## Difficulties

- No significant difficulties. Forms were relatively easy to find (2-3 clicks from homepage).
- The organization has two slightly different versions of the same form linked from different pages, which could be confusing for patients.
- The .docx version found via search was an older version with outdated branding.

# Riverwood Healthcare Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Riverwood Healthcare Center
- **Location:** Aitkin, MN 56431
- **Website:** https://riverwoodhealthcare.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit, Midwest

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms** — Searched for `"Riverwood Healthcare Center" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`. This immediately surfaced two PDF URLs hosted on the organization's WordPress site.
2. **Site-scoped search** — Searched `site:riverwoodhealthcare.org authorization release medical records`. Found the same PDFs plus references to JotForm online versions and the patient forms page.
3. **Patient Forms page** — Navigated to https://riverwoodhealthcare.org/patient-forms/ which is the canonical listing. Found a third, newer PDF link plus two JotForm online equivalents.

## What Worked
The web search strategy was very effective — the first PDF search returned a direct link. The organization hosts forms on their WordPress site and makes them straightforward to find from the Patient Forms page (1 click from main navigation).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://riverwoodhealthcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RIVERWOOD-ROI-2018.pdf
- **File size:** 368,811 bytes
- **Description:** "RIVERWOOD HEALTHCARE CENTER AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE AND DISCLOSE PATIENT INFORMATION" — This appears to be the 2018 version of their ROI form. It includes fields for patient info, release from/to, purpose, date range, record type checkboxes, restrictions for chemical dependency/behavioral health, and standard HIPAA authorization language. Appears to be an image-heavy or scanned form (large file size for a single-page form).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://riverwoodhealthcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Release-of-Information-Form-2015.pdf
- **File size:** 15,455 bytes

Includes sections for release from/to, purpose checkboxes, record type selections, HIV/AIDS/mental health/substance abuse disclosures, and standard HIPAA authorization language. Has extractable text layer.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://riverwoodhealthcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Patient-Information-Disclosure-Authorization-1.pdf
- **File size:** 100,371 bytes
- **Description:** "AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE AND DISCLOSE PATIENT INFORMATION" — This appears to be the most current version (uploaded 2025). Currently linked from the Patient Forms page as the "Authorization to Release and Disclose Information Printable Form." Contains the same general structure as the earlier versions with patient info, release from/to, purpose, record types, chemical dependency/behavioral health restrictions, and HIPAA authorization language. Appears to have form fields (fillable PDF).

## Additional Notes
- Riverwood also offers **online JotForm versions** of their release forms:
  - Information Release Form: https://hipaa.jotform.com/222405586410046
  - Consent for Release of Information: https://form.jotform.com/240436611244044
  - Permission to Verbally Discuss PHI: https://form.jotform.com/240435233247046
- The organization uses **MyChart (OCHIN)** for patient portal access.
- **Retrieval difficulty:** Easy — forms are prominently linked from the Patient Forms page and easily found via web search. Multiple versions (old and new) are available.
- All three downloaded PDFs are confirmed to be ROI/authorization forms (not privacy notices or other document types).

2. **Web search for medical records release form** — Confirmed the same URL.

  - Specific record type options (summary of care, dental records, all records, lab results, mental health records, etc.)

## Additional Notes

- Sea Mar also offers a patient portal (MyChart) at https://www.seamar.org/ohr/index.php for electronic record access.
- The form appears to be a general-purpose ROI form (third-party release), not specifically a patient-access form. It covers both sending records to other providers and patient requests.
- The form references Title 42 for sensitive substance use disorder information.

# Labette Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Labette Health
- **Location**: Parsons, KS
- **Website**: https://www.labettehealth.com
- **Type**: Community hospital, independent, nonprofit, Midwest

## Search Strategies

### Web searches tried
1. `"Labette Health" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No direct Labette Health PDF found; returned a generic PatientPop template
2. `"Labette Health" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — No results
3. `site:labettehealth.com authorization release medical records` — Found references to the Formstack online form and the Contact Us page
4. `"Labette Health" "release of information" OR "authorization for release" form PDF` — Found WyHealth.net reference mentioning faxing release forms

### Website navigation
- Navigated to https://www.labettehealth.com and explored the navigation menu
- **Patients & visitors** submenu contained a direct link: **"Medical records request form"** → `https://labetteheatlh.formstack.com/forms/medical_records_request` (note: typo in subdomain "labetteheatlh" — missing an "h")
- **Contact Us** page (https://www.labettehealth.com/contact-us/) says: "If you are needing copies of medical records, please complete the form below or visit our office located by the main entrance." Links to same Formstack form.
- **Resources** page was empty
- **Patient information** page had no ROI-related links
- **Notice of Privacy Practices** page mentioned patients' right to inspect/copy records and linked to a PDF version

## Key Finding

Labette Health does **not** provide a downloadable PDF authorization/release form. Instead, they use an **online Formstack form** at:
`https://labetteheatlh.formstack.com/forms/medical_records_request`

This is a comprehensive digital form with:
- Patient identification fields (name, DOB, address, phone)
- Authorization source selection (Hospital, Clinics, or Both)
- Release direction (to Patient/Self or Other; also a "receive from" option)
- Detailed record type checkboxes (COVID-19, Abstract, Clinic Note, Consultation Report, Discharge Summary, EKG/Stress Test, ER Record, H&P, Lab Results, Operative Report, PFT, Radiology CD, Radiology Report, Sleep Study, Vaccination History, Other)
- Date(s) of service
- Reason for request (Continued Care, Disability, Insurance, Legal, Personal, Other)
- Sensitive information exclusion options (mental health, communicable diseases, drug/alcohol)
- Electronic signature pad
- Relationship to patient (Patient/Self, DPOA, Executor, Guardian, Parent, Other)
- Photo ID upload
- Email delivery option field

The form includes standard HIPAA authorization language: authorization valid for 1 year, right to revoke, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warning.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/223399.pdf
- **What it is**: Generic "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS" template from PatientPop (a healthcare marketing platform). 1 page, simple fill-in-the-blank form. Does NOT mention Labette Health anywhere — this is a generic template that appeared in search results but is not Labette Health's own form.
- **File size**: 24,164 bytes
- **Pages**: 1

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.labettehealth.com/media/fc6f03662a5e4b14bfb881ecb89bc2f9/notice-of-privacy-practices-effective-november-17.pdf
- **What it is**: Labette Health's Notice of Privacy Practices, effective November 17, 2021. This is NOT an ROI form but is relevant context — it describes patients' rights regarding health information access and references the process for requesting records.
- **File size**: 95,150 bytes
- **Pages**: 4

### formstack-screenshot.png
- **Source**: Full-page screenshot of the Formstack online medical records request form
- **What it is**: Visual capture of Labette Health's actual ROI form (online-only, no PDF version available)

## Difficulties Encountered
1. **No downloadable PDF ROI form exists** — Labette Health has moved to an online-only Formstack form for medical records requests
2. **Website blocks simple HTTP fetches** — labettehealth.com returns 403 for basic web_fetch requests; required browser navigation
3. **Typo in Formstack URL** — The subdomain is `labetteheatlh` (missing an "h" in "health"), which is a notable quirk
4. **Generic PatientPop form in search results** — Search results returned a generic authorization form template that is not actually from Labette Health

## Assessment
Labette Health has a modern, digital-first approach to medical records requests via their Formstack online form. The form is well-organized with comprehensive options for record types, electronic signature, and email delivery. However, there is no downloadable PDF alternative for patients who prefer or need a paper form (the Contact Us page mentions visiting the office as an alternative). The form is accessible from the main navigation under Patients & visitors → Medical records request form.

# Shannon Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `Shannon Health San Angelo TX "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — returned results pointing to the medical records page and suggested PDF URLs.
2. The initially suggested PDF URLs (`/documents/medical-record-authorization.pdf`) returned **404 errors** — the filenames had been updated for 2025.
3. **Navigated the website** via Chrome DevTools to `https://www.shannonhealth.com/patients-visitors/request-medical-records/` — found the correct, current download links.
4. The page clearly links to both English and Spanish versions of the ROI form, labeled "Medical Record Authorization Form."

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.shannonhealth.com/documents/ROI-Form-2025-English.pdf
- **File size:** 115,825 bytes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.shannonhealth.com/documents/ROI-Form-2025-Spanish.pdf

- **Document type:** Authorization for Release of Information (Spanish)
- **Description:** Spanish-language version of the same ROI form. Titled "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA LA DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN." Same structure and fields as the English version.

## Difficulties
- The PDF URLs returned by the web search were outdated (returned 404). The filenames had been updated from `medical-record-authorization.pdf` to `ROI-Form-2025-English.pdf` / `ROI-Form-2025-Spanish.pdf`. Navigating the actual website page resolved this.

## Findability Assessment
- The form is easy to find: **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** (2 clicks from homepage). The page clearly explains the process and links directly to downloadable PDFs. Both English and Spanish versions are provided. Submission options include email and mail.

3. **Web search** for `site:mainlinehealth.org authorization release medical records` — found the medical records patient services page and both PDF URLs.

The form was easy to find. Main Line Health publishes it prominently and it appeared in the first search result. The parent system (Main Line Health) manages the form centrally for all its facilities including Lankenau.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mainlinehealth.org/-/media/files/pdf/basic-content/patient-services/authorizationdisclosurehealthinfo.pdf?la=en
- **File size**: 1,493,489 bytes (1.5 MB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **PDF version**: 1.6
- **Description**: Main Line Health "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form. Lists all Main Line Health facilities (Bryn Mawr Hospital, Lankenau Hospital, Riddle Hospital, Bryn Mawr Rehabilitation, Paoli Hospital, MLHC Physician Office). Includes checkboxes for record types, sensitive information consent, delivery options (encrypted USB, MyChart, paper, fax, encrypted email), and 12-month expiration. Has text layer with extractable text. Larger file — likely includes embedded images/logos.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mainlinehealth.org/-/media/files/pdf/basic-content/patient-services/authorization-for-disclosure-of-health-information.pdf
- **File size**: 164,998 bytes (165 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **PDF version**: 1.6
- **Description**: Appears to be the same or a very similar version of the Main Line Health "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form. Same content and structure as form-1.pdf but significantly smaller file size, suggesting a different export/optimization. Same text content extracted by pdftotext.

## Difficulties
- **None significant**. The form was straightforward to find via web search. Both URLs worked without bot blocking or authentication requirements.
- The two URLs appear to host the same (or nearly identical) form content, possibly different versions or optimizations of the same document.

## Key Observations
- This is a **system-level form** used across all Main Line Health facilities, not specific to Lankenau Medical Center alone.
- The form supports **patient personal use** as a purpose option and offers multiple **electronic delivery options** (encrypted USB, MyChart, encrypted email).
- Authorization expires in **12 months** unless otherwise specified.
- The form references **PA state law** and acknowledges potential fees for record copies.

- **Website**: https://crenshawcommunityhospital.com
- **Type**: Independent community hospital (for-profit), Critical Access facility, 25 licensed beds (49 staffed beds per CMS data)
- **Owner/Management**: Frey Medical Management (acquired early 2026)

## Search Strategies Tried

### 1. Web Searches
- `"Crenshaw Community Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No results
- `"Crenshaw Community Hospital" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — No results
- `site:crenshawcommunityhospital.com medical records release authorization` — No results
- `"crenshawcommunityhospital.com" filetype:pdf` — Found only regulatory/legal documents, not ROI forms
- `Crenshaw Community Hospital Luverne AL HIPAA authorization release information form` — No form found
- `"Crenshaw Community Hospital" "release of information" OR "medical records" OR "authorization" form` — No form found
- `Frey Medical Management Alabama hospital medical records release form` — No form found

### 2. Website Navigation
- Visited homepage — no "Medical Records" or "Patient Forms" link in navigation
- Checked **Patient Portal** page — only MyCareCorner login link, no downloadable forms
- Checked **About** page — found "VIEW DISCLOSURES" link, but the disclosures page returns 404
- Navigation only has: About, Our Services, Careers, Contact, Patient Portal, Data Breach Incident, Price Transparency

### 3. WordPress REST API Enumeration
- **Pages API** (`/wp-json/wp/v2/pages`): Listed 25 pages — none related to medical records, forms, or ROI
- **Media API** (`/wp-json/wp/v2/media`): Listed ~100+ media items across 2 pages
  - Only 4 PDFs found, none are ROI forms:
    - Visitation Policy (3 versions)
    - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment
  - All other media items are images (.jpg, .png)

### 4. Sitemap Check
- `sitemap.xml` and `page-sitemap.xml` — only 24 pages listed, no forms pages

### 5. Parent Company Check
- Frey Medical Management (freymm.com) is a simple marketing site with no patient-facing forms
- No centralized form portal for managed hospitals

### 6. MedicalRecords.com
- Third-party records request service only — no downloadable hospital-specific form

## Result

**No ROI / Authorization for Medical Records form was found online.**

Crenshaw Community Hospital does not appear to publish any patient forms on their website. The site is minimal, focused on basic information about services, providers, and contact details. Patients would need to call (334) 335-3374 or visit in person to obtain a medical records release form.

## Difficulties Encountered
- Very small website with limited pages (25 total)
- No "Patient Forms" or "Medical Records" section exists
- Disclosures page (linked from About page) returns 404
- Recent ownership change (Frey Medical Management, Jan 2026) may mean the website is in transition
- Hospital experienced a data breach in 2025, which may have affected their online presence

## Downloaded PDFs
None — no ROI or authorization forms were found to download.

# Broward Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Broward Health "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found the direct PDF URL and the medical records request page.
2. **Website navigation** — visited https://www.browardhealth.org/patients-and-visitors/information-request/medical-records-request which is the dedicated Medical Records Request page. Found links to ROI forms in 4 languages (English, Spanish, Creole, Portuguese).
3. **curl download** — Failed due to Cloudflare bot protection ("Just a moment..." challenge page). Had to use browser-based download instead.
4. **Browser-based download** — Used Chrome DevTools to fetch PDFs via JavaScript `fetch()` from the authenticated browser session. Note: the lowercase URL for the English form failed even in the browser; the case-sensitive URL (`ROI-English-032620.ashx`) succeeded.

## Difficulties

- **Cloudflare protection**: Direct curl requests (even with realistic User-Agent and Referer headers) were blocked by Cloudflare's bot detection, returning an HTML challenge page instead of the PDF.
- **Case-sensitive URLs**: The English form URL linked in the page (`roi-english-032620.ashx`) failed with a `fetch()` error when lowercase. The original case-sensitive URL (`ROI-English-032620.ashx`) from the CDN subdomain worked.
- **Image-only English form**: The English version is a scanned image with no text layer, while the Spanish, Creole, and Portuguese versions have extractable text — suggesting the English form is an older scan that was never OCR'd or recreated digitally.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.browardhealth.org/-/media/Broward-Health/Files/Patients-and-Visitors/ROI-English-032620.ashx`

- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Broward Health Authorization for Release of Health Information — English version. This is an image-only scan (single grayscale JPEG, 1700×2200 px at 200 DPI). No extractable text layer. Dated 03/26/20 based on filename.

- **Pages**: 1 (based on text content)
- **Description**: Broward Health Authorization for Release of Health Information — Portuguese version. Has extractable text. Same ROI form translated to Portuguese.

## Additional Notes

- Broward Health also offers an **online request option** via a third-party service (Swellbox) at `https://www.swellbox.com/broward-health-wizard.html` — this is a web-based wizard for requesting medical records without needing to download/print/scan the PDF form.
- The Medical Records Request page is well-organized and easy to find (Patients and Visitors > Information Request > Medical Records Request — 3 clicks from homepage).
- The page lists submission instructions for multiple Broward Health facilities (Medical Center, North, Coral Springs, Imperial Point, East Imaging Center, Weston) with fax numbers for each.
- Processing time noted as approximately 3 business days.

# Duke University Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for filetype:pdf** — `Duke University Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — found direct PDF URLs from dukehealth.org
2. **Web search for medical records page** — `Duke Health "medical records" "release form" request records authorization` — found the main forms landing page at dukehealth.org/medical-records/authorization-forms-and-instructions-medical-records
3. **Site-scoped search** — `site:dukehealth.org authorization release medical records form` — confirmed URLs and found additional resources
4. **Navigated the official forms page** — https://www.dukehealth.org/medical-records/authorization-forms-and-instructions-medical-records — listed all available forms with download links

## Difficulties

- No significant difficulties. Duke Health has a well-organized medical records section with clearly labeled form downloads.
- The web search initially surfaced an older revision of the main form (Rev. 4/2024); the official page now links to a newer version (Rev. 3/2025).
- One form found via a Duke outpatient clinic site (sites.duke.edu) was an image-only scan with no text layer.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dukehealth.org/sites/default/files/general_page/M3132AuthorizationforReleaseofInformation_Rev%20202312_V2.pdf
- **Description**: Duke Health Enterprise Authorization for Release of Information (M3132, Rev. 4/2024). Multi-page form with text layer. Covers patient info, recipient, information to release, delivery method, signatures. This is the main ROI authorization form (older revision).
- **File size**: 560,017 bytes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dukehealth.org/sites/default/files/2019-04-01_duke_health_authorization_instructions.pdf
- **Description**: Instructions for Completing the Authorization for Release of Information Form. A companion document explaining each section of the authorization form (Parts A through F). Has text layer.
- **File size**: 508,235 bytes

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://sites.duke.edu/dukeoutpatientclinic_howto/files/2024/06/Release-from-Duke.pdf
- **Description**: Release of information form from the Duke Outpatient Clinic site. Single-page image-only scan (no text layer). Appears to be a scanned version of a release form used at the outpatient clinic.
- **File size**: 568,011 bytes

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dukehealth.org/sites/default/files/clinical_trials_information/M3132_English_Duke%20Health%20Authorization%20to%20Release%20Information.pdf
- **Description**: Duke Health Enterprise Authorization for Release of Information (M3132, Rev. 3/2025). This is the current version linked from the official forms page. Multi-page form with text layer. Same structure as form-1 but updated revision.
- **File size**: 816,166 bytes

## Summary

Duke Health provides an excellent, well-organized medical records section at dukehealth.org. The main authorization form (M3132) is prominently linked from the "Authorization Forms and Instructions for Medical Records" page, available in both English and Spanish. The page also offers companion instructions, a verbal release form, proxy access form, external records request form, and other related documents. The retrieval difficulty was **easy** — forms are 2 clicks from the homepage (Medical Records → Authorization Forms).

# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Community Medical Center
- **Location**: Toms River, NJ
- **Website**: https://www.rwjbh.org/community-medical-center/
- **Parent System**: RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH)

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for "Community Medical Center Toms River NJ authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately returned the CMC medical records page on rwjbh.org.
2. **Web search** for "RWJBarnabas Health medical records release form authorization PDF" — found the system-wide Universal Release of Information form.
3. **Web search** for "site:rwjbh.org authorization release medical records form" — confirmed the Universal ROI form URL.
4. **Navigated** to the CMC medical records page at https://www.rwjbh.org/community-medical-center/patients-visitors/medical-records/ — found two CMC-specific form links and reference to a third-party online request option (Ciox/Swellbox).

## What Worked
Direct web search was highly effective. The CMC medical records page clearly links to downloadable forms and also offers an online request option through Ciox (Swellbox).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.rwjbh.org/documents/community-medical-center-/CMC-Authority-to-Disclose-Health-Information.pdf
- **Description**: "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility"
- **Pages**: 1
- **File size**: 165,175 bytes
- **Text layer**: No (image-only scan, created in Adobe Photoshop CS2, dated 2017)
- **Fillable fields**: None
- **Initial impression**: CMC-specific ROI form for releasing records FROM CMC to the patient or another recipient. This is the primary outbound release authorization form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.rwjbh.org/documents/community-medical-center-/med-records-cmc-to.pdf
- **Description**: "Request for Release of Health Information to CMC"
- **Pages**: 1
- **File size**: 413,261 bytes
- **Text layer**: No (image-only, created via PScript5/Acrobat Distiller, originally 2015, modified 2021)
- **Fillable fields**: None
- **Initial impression**: Form for requesting release of records TO CMC (inbound records from another provider). This is the reverse direction — not a patient access ROI form but a request for outside records to be sent to CMC.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.rwjbh.org/documents/medical-group/Revised-Universal-Release-of-Information-Authorization-Form.pdf
- **Description**: "Universal Release of Information Authorization Form" (RWJBH system-wide)
- **Pages**: 3
- **File size**: 201,591 bytes
- **Text layer**: Yes (full text extractable, created in Microsoft Word, dated Nov 2025)
- **Fillable fields**: None (tagged PDF but no interactive form fields)
- **Initial impression**: System-wide RWJBH authorization form covering all facilities including Community Medical Center. Lists all RWJBH locations with checkboxes. More modern and comprehensive than the CMC-specific forms. Covers authorization to use/disclose protected health information.

## Difficulties
- **Forms 1 and 2 are image-only scans** — no text layer, no fillable fields, created years ago (2015-2017). Poor digital accessibility.
- **Form 2 has a rotated page** (180° rotation noted in metadata), which may cause display issues.
- No difficulties with downloading — all URLs were directly accessible without bot blocking or authentication.

## Additional Notes
- CMC also offers an **online electronic request** through Ciox/Swellbox at https://www.swellbox.com/rwjbarnabas-cmc-wizard.html (not downloaded as it's a web app, not a PDF form).
- The system-wide form (form-3) appears to be the most current document (Nov 2025) and is likely the preferred form going forward, superseding the older CMC-specific scans.
- Contact for medical records: cmcroimedicalrecords@rwjbh.org, Fax: 732-557-2209.

# Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center - ROI Form Search Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center, Inc.
- **Website**: https://www.aehchc.org/
- **Location**: Clarksdale, MS 38614
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies Tried

### 1. Web searches (multiple queries)
- `"Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No results
- `"Aaron E. Henry" "medical records" "release form" Clarksdale Mississippi` — No results
- `site:aehchc.org medical records authorization release form` — No results
- `"Aaron E Henry" OR "AEHCHC" "release of information" OR "authorization" OR "medical records" PDF Mississippi` — No results
- `"aehchc.org" "release of information" OR "medical records request" OR "authorization to release" OR "ROI"` — No results
- `aehchc.org wp-content uploads PDF` — Found spam PDFs in formidable plugin uploads, no health forms
- `"aehchc" patient forms download PDF` — Found school-based consent form on pcmac.org
- `"Aaron E Henry" OR aehchc "notice of privacy practices" PDF` — No results
- `"Aaron E Henry" OR "aehchc" "consent to release" OR "authorization to disclose" OR "release of records"` — No results

### 2. Website navigation (browser)
- Explored full site structure via Chrome DevTools
- Checked every page in the XML sitemap (`/wp-sitemap.xml` → `/page-sitemap.xml`)
- Pages on site: Home, About (Mission, History, Administration, Board, Providers, Blog), Services, Locations, D.A.R.T.S. (transit), Job Openings, Patient Registration Forms, COVID-19 Notice, Privacy Policy, Terms, Accessibility Statement, Calendar, Patient-Centered Medical Home, Special Events, News
- **No medical records, ROI, or HIPAA-related pages exist on the site**
- "Patient Registration Forms" section contains only a contact form and online registration forms (patient + student)
- Privacy Policy page is a website privacy policy, not a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices

### 3. Direct URL guessing
- Tried common PDF paths under `/wp-content/uploads/` (release-of-information.pdf, authorization-form.pdf, etc.)
- All returned 403 — the entire uploads directory is access-restricted

### 4. Wayback Machine
- Checked web.archive.org for historical pages matching "release" — no relevant results

### 5. Third-party sites
- Found school-based consent form (AEH-branded) hosted on pcmac.org (North Panola School District)
- Patient portal is eClinicalWorks (mycw147.ecwcloud.com) — requires login, forms may be available behind portal

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: http://images.pcmac.org/Uploads/NorthPanolaSD/NorthPanolaSD/Divisions/Forms/AEH-CONSENT%20FORM-%20rev%20June%202019%20re-revised%20(002)_Fillable_%7BSISE7D801F6F09B%7D.pdf
- **Document type**: School-based health consent form (Mississippi Children's Health Project Parent/Guardian Consent Form)
- **Description**: A fillable PDF consent form for parents/guardians to authorize AEH to provide health services (medical, dental, vision) to their children through a mobile medical unit visiting schools. Includes child health history, insurance information, and consent to treat. This is NOT a Release of Information / ROI form — it's a consent-to-treat form for school-based services.
- **Initial impression**: Not an ROI form; consent for school-based healthcare services

## Conclusion

**No ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form was found online** for Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center. The organization's website is focused on information about services, locations, staff, and news. Patient-facing forms are limited to registration forms (available as online web forms, not PDFs). The only downloadable PDF form found was a school-based health consent form hosted on a third-party school district site.

## Difficulties Encountered
- Website has very limited patient-facing resources
- No dedicated medical records or HIM page exists
- WordPress uploads directory returns 403 for all direct PDF access attempts
- No HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices is published online
- The organization appears to handle medical records requests entirely in-person or by phone
- The eClinicalWorks patient portal (behind login) may contain records request functionality, but this cannot be verified without patient credentials

# Gastro Florida — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Gastro Florida
- **Website:** https://gastrofl.com
- **Location:** Clearwater, FL
- **Type:** Independent physician practice (gastroenterology), for-profit

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web search for authorization/release forms
- Searched: `"Gastro Florida" "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form`
- Searched: `site:gastrofl.com authorization release medical records`
- Searched: `"gastrofl.com" "wp-content/uploads" authorization OR release OR "medical records" PDF`
- Searched: `"Gastro Florida" "medical records release" OR "authorization form" OR "ROI form" download PDF`
- **Result:** No standalone ROI/authorization form PDF found. All sources confirm Gastro Florida uses a third-party online portal (Sharecare/HDS) for medical records requests.

### 2. Website navigation
- **Patient Forms page** (https://gastrofl.com/patient-forms/): Lists several downloadable PDFs (new patient paperwork, HIPAA notice, patient rights, financial policy) plus a link to "Medical Records Request" which redirects to an external Sharecare portal.
- **Medical Records page** (https://gastrofl.com/medical-records/): Completely empty — only has the heading "Medical Records" with no content, instructions, or downloadable forms.

### 3. Sharecare/HDS Portal
- URL: https://submissionportal.hds.sharecare.com/lfserver/PatientRequest?ClientID=FL2000
- Redirects to: https://myplatform.hds.sharecare.com/submission-tools/ui/patient?clientId=FL2000
- This is a fully online, multi-step medical records request submission tool (progress bar shows ~31 steps). It requires identity verification via driver's license/state ID. No downloadable PDF form is available through this portal.

## Key Finding
**Gastro Florida does not publish a downloadable ROI/authorization form.** Medical records requests are handled entirely through a third-party online portal (Sharecare/HDS). The new patient paperwork contains a brief "Authorization to Release Information" clause, but it only authorizes release to third-party payors and providers for care/billing purposes — it is not a patient-initiated records request form.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** http://gastrofl.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NEW-PT-PAPERWORK-UPDATED-2.2.23.pdf
- **Source page:** https://gastrofl.com/patient-forms/ ("New Patient Paperwork – English")
- **Pages:** 4
- **File size:** 688,105 bytes
- **Description:** New patient registration packet including: patient registration form, financial policy, HIPAA consent, and patient consent for treatment. Contains a brief "Authorization to Release Information" section that authorizes release of records to third-party payors and for care coordination — NOT a patient-initiated ROI form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://gastrofl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Privacy-Practices-Notice-Gastro-Florida.pdf
- **Source page:** https://gastrofl.com/patient-forms/ ("HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices")
- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 97,058 bytes
- **Description:** Single-page HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices summary. Describes patient rights including the right to get a copy of medical records. Not an authorization/request form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://gastrofl.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-Updated-for-2026.pdf
- **Source page:** Footer link on gastrofl.com ("Privacy Policy")
- **Pages:** 7
- **File size:** 321,624 bytes
- **Description:** Updated (2026) full Notice of Privacy Practices. Contains detailed description of patient rights and how health information may be used/disclosed. References Privacy Officer Josh Frazier, phone (727) 347-0536. Not an authorization/request form.

## Difficulties
- **No downloadable ROI form exists.** Gastro Florida has outsourced their entire medical records request process to a third-party vendor (Sharecare/HDS). There is no PDF authorization form available for download on their website.
- **Medical Records page is empty.** The dedicated medical records page at gastrofl.com/medical-records/ has no content — just a heading with no instructions, links, or forms.
- **Authorization embedded in patient paperwork.** The closest thing to an authorization form is a brief clause in the new patient paperwork (form-1.pdf), but it only covers release to payors/providers, not patient-initiated records requests.

- **Parent System:** Ivy Creek Healthcare (also operates Elmore Community Hospital, urgent cares, primary cares, home health, hospice, pharmacies)
- **Patient Portal:** MedConnect (https://patlogin.medconnect-inc.com/Login.aspx)

## Search Strategies Tried

### 1. Direct Web Searches (multiple queries)
- `"Lake Martin Community Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No results
- `"Lake Martin Community Hospital" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — No results
- `site:ivycreekhealth.com authorization release medical records` — No results

- `inurl:ivycreekhealth.com inurl:pdf` — No indexed PDFs found
- `"Lake Martin Community Hospital" CIOX OR Datavant OR HealthMark OR MRO OR ChartRequest` — No third-party ROI services identified

### 2. Website Navigation (via browser)
- Visited the Lake Martin Community Hospital page at ivycreekhealth.com
- Checked all tabs: Home, Services, Providers, FAQs, Contact, Careers, Privacy Policy
- **FAQs tab** contains: "How do I obtain medical records? Medical records can be requested through our Health Information Management department. A signed authorization form is required to protect patient privacy." — No link to a downloadable form.
- Checked ivycreekhealth.com/patient-resources — 404 Not Found
- Checked ivycreekhealth.com/forms — 404 Not Found
- Checked ivycreekhealth.com/portal — MedConnect patient portal login page (behind login wall)

### 3. Parent System (Ivy Creek Healthcare)
- Checked Elmore Community Hospital (sister hospital) page — same structure, no forms
- Checked Ivy Creek Healthcare privacy policy page — mentions contacting Chief Privacy/Compliance Officer to exercise rights, provides address/email but no downloadable form
- Checked sitemap_index.xml and page-sitemap.xml — no forms pages listed anywhere in the site's 21 pages

### 4. WordPress Uploads Directory Probing
- Confirmed that PDFs do exist in wp-content/uploads (found a Butler Home Health policy PDF at /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/)
- Attempted to scan common authorization form filename patterns across multiple year/month directories — no ROI-related PDFs found

### 5. Wayback Machine / Archive
- Checked Wayback Machine for lakemartincommunityhospital.com and lakemartinhospital.com — no archives found
- Checked Wayback Machine for ivycreekhealth.com uploads directory — access denied

### 6. Third-Party Records Services
- Checked MedicalRecords.com listing for the hospital — only offers a paid intermediary service, does not host the hospital's actual form
- No evidence of CIOX, Datavant, HealthMark, MRO, or ChartRequest integration

## Result

**No ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form was found online.**

The hospital's FAQ explicitly states that records can be requested through the Health Information Management department with a signed authorization form, but the form itself is not published on the website. The patient portal (MedConnect) mentions "View/Complete Forms" as a feature, suggesting forms may only be available to authenticated portal users.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The Ivy Creek Healthcare website is relatively bare-bones — no patient forms section, no downloadable documents section
- No historical website archives exist for the hospital under any prior domain
- The hospital appears to handle ROI requests entirely offline or through the patient portal login

## Downloaded PDFs
None — no forms were found to download.

## Retrieval Difficulty
**Impossible** — The form is not published on the public-facing website.

# The Baton Rouge Clinic — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for "The Baton Rouge Clinic authorization release health information medical records form PDF" — immediately returned direct PDF links to two authorization forms hosted on batonrougeclinic.com.
2. **Site-specific search** (`site:batonrougeclinic.com`) confirmed the same results.
3. **Visited the downloadable forms page** at `https://batonrougeclinic.com/patient-information/downloadable-forms/` to confirm completeness — discovered a third form ("Right of Access") not surfaced in initial search results.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy

All forms were directly linked from a well-organized "Downloadable Forms" page under Patient Information. No login, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering required. PDFs downloaded cleanly via curl.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://batonrougeclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AuthFrom-01.31.22.pdf
- **File size**: 200,510 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information FROM The Baton Rouge Clinic, AMC" — a standard ROI form for releasing patient records from the clinic to another party. Includes fields for patient identification, recipient information, date ranges, types of records to release, purpose of disclosure, and special authorization for sensitive records (drug/alcohol, psychiatric, HIV/AIDS). Dated January 2022.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://batonrougeclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AuthTo-02.28.2023.pdf
- **File size**: 264,223 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information TO The Baton Rouge Clinic, AMC" — an incoming records request form, authorizing another organization to send records to the Baton Rouge Clinic. Similar structure to form-1 but in the opposite direction. Dated February 2023.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://batonrougeclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RightOfAccess01.22.pdf
- **File size**: 123,342 bytes
- **Description**: "Right of Access Form" — allows a patient to designate another person (e.g., spouse, child) to access their records. Explicitly references HIPAA 45 C.F.R. 164.524. Offers choice of electronic or hard copy disclosure. Notably more patient-centered than the general ROI forms — includes electronic delivery option and HIPAA Right of Access citation. Dated January 2022.

## Observations

- The clinic maintains three distinct medical records forms, well-organized under "Medical Records" on their downloadable forms page.
- The "Right of Access" form (form-3) is the most patient-access-specific, with explicit HIPAA Right of Access reference and electronic delivery option.
- The "Release FROM" form (form-1) is the traditional ROI/authorization form for releasing records outward.
- The "Release TO" form (form-2) is for incoming records transfers.
- All three forms have text layers (not image-only scans) but appear to be flat PDFs without fillable form fields.
- The HIPAA Privacy Notice was also available on the same page but was not downloaded as it is not an ROI form.

# Community Health Center of Central Missouri — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies
- **Web search**: Searched for `Community Health Center of Central Missouri "authorization" "release" "health information" form` — immediately found direct PDF links on chccmo.org.
- **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:chccmo.org medical records release authorization form` — confirmed the same URLs and found a 2025 updated version.
- No need to navigate the website manually; the forms were directly linked from WordPress uploads.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://chccmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Release-of-Records-updated-2025.pdf
- **File size**: 119,119 bytes
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (2025 updated version)
- **Notes**: Has text layer. Includes fields for patient info, sender/receiver, method of release (fax, mail, hold for pickup, email), information to be released (entire record, lab, immunization, consult reports, ultrasound, billing), date range options, and purpose of disclosure. This is the current version of the form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.chccmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Release-of-Records-updated-2023.pdf
- **File size**: 82,830 bytes
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (2023 version)
- **Notes**: Has text layer. Similar to form-1 but older version. Lists specific clinic locations (Jefferson City, Linn, California, Fulton). Includes dental records as an option. Authorization expires in 1 year. Mentions sensitive records (mental health, drug/alcohol, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing).

## Difficulties
- None. Both forms were easily discoverable via web search and directly downloadable as PDFs from the organization's WordPress site. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues encountered.

## Summary
The organization publishes their ROI form directly on their website as a PDF. Two versions were found — a 2025 update and the previous 2023 version. Both are general release/obtain forms (not patient-access-specific). Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

# Black River Memorial Hospital - ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Black River Memorial Hospital (part of Black River Health)
- **Website:** https://blackriverhealth.com
- **Location:** Black River Falls, WI
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit, Midwest

## Search Strategies

### What worked
- **Web search** for `site:blackriverhealth.com authorization release medical records` immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL.
- **Patient Resources page** (https://blackriverhealth.com/patient-resources/) has a "Forms" section with the ROI form listed under "General Forms" as "Authorization to Disclose Information" with description: "Allows us to share or receive information from other healthcare facilities or providers."

### Other searches tried
- `"Black River Memorial Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct results
- `"Black River Memorial Hospital" Black River Falls WI "medical records" "release form"` — general guidance but no direct link

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://blackriverhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Release-of-Information-Authorization.pdf
- **Document type:** Release of Information Authorization form (ROI form)
- **Pages:** 2
- **File size:** 515,295 bytes
- **Description:** A comprehensive ROI/authorization form titled "Release of Information Authorization" from Black River Health. Page 1 collects patient information, specifies the healthcare provider/facility releasing records (checkboxes for Krohn Clinic, Black River Memorial Hospital, Black River Healthcare Clinic), destination for records, reason for release (continuing care, worker's comp, school, per patient request, insurance, legal, FMLA/disability, etc.), types of information to release (with service date range), format options (mailed, faxed, pick up, CD, electronic/PDF), and expiration terms. Page 2 contains patient rights information including right to receive a copy, right to refuse, right to revoke, re-disclosure notice, right to inspect, prohibition of conditions, and signature lines for patient and authorized person.
- **Text extraction:** Very sparse via pdftotext — the form appears to use many small images for text labels (Word-generated PDF with text rendered as images in some sections). Only "MRN", "FIN", and checkbox characters were extracted. Visual inspection via browser confirmed the full form content.
- **Fillable fields:** PDF metadata reports `Form: none` — no interactive form fields detected.
- **Created:** August 6, 2025 (modified December 4, 2025) by Austyn Zinn using Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365.

## Difficulties
- **Text extraction limitation:** The PDF, despite being created from Microsoft Word, renders most text as small images rather than searchable text. pdftotext extracted almost nothing. Visual inspection was required to confirm the document's content.
- **No other ROI-specific forms found:** The patient resources page lists several forms (Patient Information, Verbal Consent, Authorization to Disclose, Advance Directives, minor treatment consent, procedure prep forms) but only one ROI/authorization form.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The form was straightforward to find — it's linked directly from the Patient Resources page under a clearly labeled "Forms" section, and web search also surfaced the direct URL.

# Community Health Center, Inc. — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Community Health Center, Inc.
- **Website**: https://www.chc1.com
- **Location**: Middletown, CT
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `"Community Health Center Inc Middletown CT" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct results.
2. **Site-scoped search**: `site:chc1.com authorization release medical records` — found references to the patient forms page and two direct PDF URLs.
3. **Patient forms page**: Navigated to https://www.chc1.com/for-patients/resources/patient-forms/ — confirmed the ROI forms section. The page now links to Luma Health online form portals rather than direct PDF downloads.
4. **Direct PDF URLs**: Found two English PDFs hosted on the site (one from 2024, one from 2019), plus a Spanish version at a guessed URL based on the English filename pattern.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.chc1.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Release-of-Information-for-B23.pdf
- **File size**: 243,549 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information" — appears to be a site-specific version (references "B23 Site" and "Birth to Three" program with pre-filled recipient info for Rebecca Smith/Birth to Three at 450 Columbus Blvd Suite 205, Hartford CT). This is a customized variant of the standard CHC ROI form for a specific program referral.
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Initial impression**: ROI/authorization form, site-specific variant

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.chc1.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ROI-English.pdf
- **File size**: 176,978 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information" — the standard English version of the CHC ROI form. Includes sections for releasing or obtaining records, record type checkboxes, date range, special categories (drug/alcohol, psychiatric, HIV/AIDS), 90-day default expiration, and signature. Revised 6/2019.
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Initial impression**: Standard ROI/authorization form (English)

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.chc1.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ROI-Spanish.pdf
- **File size**: 177,997 bytes
- **Description**: "Autorización para Divulgar u Obtener Información Médica" — Spanish translation of the standard CHC ROI form. Same structure and content as form-2.pdf.
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Initial impression**: Standard ROI/authorization form (Spanish)

## Difficulties
- The patient forms page has transitioned from direct PDF downloads to Luma Health online form portals for ROI. The two current links ("CHC to release health information to another agency" and "CHC to obtain health information from another agency") point to `patient.lumahealth.io` survey URLs rather than static PDFs.
- The older PDF versions are still hosted on the WordPress uploads directory and were discoverable via web search.
- No difficulties with bot blocking or download issues — all PDFs downloaded cleanly with curl.

## Key Observations
- CHC provides both English and Spanish versions of the ROI form.
- The form serves dual purposes: both releasing records TO another party and obtaining records FROM another party.
- The form includes a self-request option ("If releasing information to ME") with mail, fax, pick-up, and email delivery options.
- 90-day default expiration for authorization.
- The patient forms page also mentions the myCHC patient portal for accessing records online.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The forms were easy to find — the medical records page is accessible from the main navigation under "Patients & Visitors" and clearly links to downloadable PDFs.
- The hospital also offers an online request portal via Swellbox as an alternative to the paper forms.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy

- Web search for `NorthLakes Community Clinic "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — immediately returned two PDF URLs hosted on nlccwi.org.

- **Location**: Grafton, WI
- **Parent System**: Advocate Health (formerly Advocate Aurora Health / Aurora Health Care)
- **Website**: https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/locations/hospital/aurora-medical-center-grafton

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `Aurora Medical Center Grafton "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no facility-specific form found; Aurora uses system-wide forms.
2. **Web search** for `Aurora Health Care "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` — found the main authorization form PDF URL and the medical records page.
3. **Navigated** to the Aurora Health Care medical records page at https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records — this page clearly lists all available forms with download links.

The medical records page was easy to find (Home > Patients & Visitors > Medical Records) and well-organized. Aurora uses system-level forms for all facilities including Aurora Medical Center - Grafton.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/-/media/Project/Health-System-Enterprise/AuroraHealthCareOrg/aurorahealthcare/documents/patients-visitors/medical-records/authorization-for-release-of-information-wi-il.PDF`
- **Document type**: Authorization to Release Protected Health Information (general ROI form)
- **Description**: 1-page fillable PDF for authorizing release of health information to third parties. Includes checkboxes for record types (medical records, imaging, billing), purpose of release, and delivery method options (mail, encrypted email, CD, patient portal). This version was found via web search and appears to be an older or alternate URL.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/-/media/Project/Health-System-Enterprise/AuroraHealthCareOrg/aurorahealthcare/documents/patients-visitors/medical-records/authorization-to-release-protected-health-information-wi-il-s300503.PDF`
- **Document type**: Authorization to Release Protected Health Information (general ROI form)
- **Description**: Same title and content layout as form-1.pdf, but a different file (different MD5 hash, same file size). This is the version directly linked from the medical records page. May represent a different revision of the same form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/-/media/Project/Health-System-Enterprise/AuroraHealthCareOrg/aurorahealthcare/documents/patients-visitors/medical-records/patient-request-for-health-information-s88411en.PDF`
- **Document type**: Patient Request for Health Information (patient-specific access form)
- **Description**: 1-page form specifically for patients requesting their own health information. Mentions the patient portal (LiveWell) as an alternative. Includes checkboxes for record types and imaging. This is the patient-access-specific form (distinct from the general third-party authorization form).

## Additional Forms Available (not downloaded - not primary ROI forms)
The medical records page also links to:
- Authorization form in Spanish
- Patient Request form in Spanish
- Instructions for completing each form
- Patient Request for PHI Release Restriction
- Patient Request for Accounting of Disclosure
- Revocation of Authorization to Release PHI
- Third Party Electronic Data Request

## Difficulties
- **None significant**. Aurora Health Care has an excellent, well-organized medical records page with clear form links.
- The organization uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones for Aurora Medical Center - Grafton.
- Two different URLs exist for the authorization form (form-1 and form-2) which appear to be slightly different versions of the same document.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
Forms were found within 2 clicks from the main website and also appeared in web search results. Multiple submission methods are offered (email, fax, mail, in-person).

# UW Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** UW Medical Center
- **Parent System:** UW Medicine (University of Washington)
- **Website:** https://www.uwmedicine.org
- **Location:** Seattle, WA

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `UW Medical Center Seattle "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found the form hosted on the UW compliance site (`depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf`) and two alternate URLs on `uwmedicine.org`.

2. **Web search** for `UW Medicine "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` — confirmed the same form and linked to the patient forms page.

3. **Web search** for `site:uwmedicine.org authorization release medical records form` — found a 2022 accessible version URL and the patient forms page.

4. **Navigated** the UW Medicine website: Patient & Visitor Resources → Patient Forms → "Medical records and authorization forms" expandable section. This confirmed the primary ROI form and revealed several other authorization/privacy forms.

## Download Attempts

- **URL 1 (uwmedicine.org 2022 version):** `https://www.uwmedicine.org/sites/stevie/files/2022-04/UH0626-Accessible%20%281%29.pdf` — **BLOCKED** (returned "Access Denied" HTML). Bot protection on uwmedicine.org's file hosting.
- **URL 2 (UW compliance site):** `https://depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf` — **SUCCESS** (321,683 bytes, valid PDF).
- **URL 3 (uwmedicine.org 2019 version):** `https://www.uwmedicine.org/sites/stevie/files/2019-07/Patient%20Authorization%20for%20Protected%20Health%20Information%20103f7_AuthRq%20PDFA.pdf` — **BLOCKED** (same "Access Denied").

The patient forms page on uwmedicine.org links to `depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf`, so the compliance site URL is the canonical/current location.

## Difficulties

- The uwmedicine.org CDN (`/sites/stevie/files/...`) blocks curl requests even with a realistic browser User-Agent string, returning a 403 "Access Denied" page. However, the same form is available without restriction from the UW compliance department site (`depts.washington.edu`), and the patient forms page links there directly.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf
- **File size:** 321,683 bytes
- **Pages:** Multi-page (3 pages based on content — patient info, authorization details, and instructions)
- **Document title:** U0626 (internal form number)
- **Created:** December 2025
- **Description:** "Patient Authorization to Disclose, Release, and/or Obtain Protected Health Information" — This is UW Medicine's primary ROI form. It covers all UW Medicine facilities (Harborview, UW Medical Center Montlake & Northwest, UW Medicine Primary Care, UW Physicians). Includes fields for patient info, purpose of request, facility selection, recipient details, record types (medical records, billing, immunizations, radiology, labs, clinic notes), format preferences (paper, CD/DVD, MyChart, email), sensitive information opt-in (HIV, mental health, substance abuse, sexual assault), and expiration date. The form notes that recent records are available via MyChart for immediate download.

## Other Forms on Patient Forms Page (not downloaded)
The "Medical records and authorization forms" section also lists:
- Notice of Privacy Practices Acknowledgment
- Patient Authorization for Publicity
- Patient Authorization for Publication
- Patient Authorization for Photography/Video
- Request for Additional Privacy Protection
- Request for Correction or Amendment of Medical Record
- Request to Restrict Disclosure to Health Plans (self-pay)

These are related but not ROI/records release forms.

# Barnes-Jewish Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Barnes-Jewish Hospital
- **Location:** St. Louis, MO
- **Website:** https://www.barnesjewish.org
- **Parent System:** BJC HealthCare
- **Type:** Teaching hospital, nonprofit, major system (affiliated with Washington University School of Medicine)

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search** for `Barnes-Jewish Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found references to the form on cocodoc.com and bjc.org.
2. **Web search** for `Barnes-Jewish Hospital "medical records" "release form" PDF` — found official Barnes-Jewish Hospital medical records page and references to recdep.com (third-party records service).
3. **Web search** for `site:barnesjewish.org authorization release medical records` — found direct BJC-hosted PDF and confirmed the official Medical Records Requests page.
4. **Navigated directly** to https://www.barnesjewish.org/Patients-Visitors/Medical-Records-Requests — this was the definitive source, listing multiple forms with clear download links.

## What Worked
The official Barnes-Jewish Hospital website has a well-organized "Medical Records Requests" page under Patient & Visitor Information. It clearly distinguishes between:
- **Individual requests** (patients requesting their own records)
- **Third-party requests** (requesting records be sent to another party)
- **Next of Kin requests** (for deceased patients)
- **Amendment requests** (correcting records)

All forms are directly linked as PDFs — no login or portal required.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.barnesjewish.org/Portals/0/PDF-Files/BJH_Individual_Authorization_Form.pdf
- **Document type:** Individual Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information
- **Description:** This is the patient-access-specific form — for patients requesting their own records. It's titled "REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION BY INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS." It includes checkboxes for specific record types (Abstract, X-Ray Report, Emergency Report, Discharge Summary, History & Physical, Progress Notes, etc.) and fields for patient identification. This is the primary ROI form for patient self-requests.
- **Pages:** Multi-page PDF (version 1.6)
- **Has text layer:** Yes

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.barnesjewish.org/Portals/0/PDF-Files/Authorization_for_Release_of_Info.pdf
- **Document type:** Authorization for Release of Information (general/third-party)
- **Description:** This is the general ROI form — "Authorization For Release Of Information" — for authorizing Barnes-Jewish Hospital to release records to a third party (physician, institution, agency). Includes checkboxes for record types, fields for recipient, purpose, and standard HIPAA authorization language. Also has a litigation section on page 2.
- **Pages:** Multi-page PDF (version 1.7)
- **Has text layer:** Yes

## Difficulties Encountered
- None significant. The official website has a clearly organized Medical Records Requests page with direct PDF download links.
- Barnes-Jewish Hospital distinguishes between individual patient access and third-party release, which is a good practice — they provide separate forms for each use case.
- The page also mentions that Washington University maintains separate medical records for patients seen at WashU Clinics, which could be confusing for patients.

# Fisher-Titus Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Fisher-Titus Medical Center
- **Location:** Norwalk, OH
- **Website:** https://www.fishertitus.org
- **Type:** Independent community hospital, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Fisher-Titus Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return direct PDF links but confirmed the form exists.
2. **Web search** for `Fisher-Titus Medical Center Norwalk Ohio "medical records" "release form"` — identified the patient forms page and medical records page.
3. **Web search** for `site:fishertitus.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the patient forms page at `/patients-guests/patient-forms` and medical records page at `/medical-records`.
4. **Direct website navigation** to the patient forms page — found two downloadable forms directly linked.
5. **Medical records page** (`/medical-records`) — found a second version of the authorization form linked as "Medical Records Request Form."

## What Worked
Direct navigation to the **Patient Forms page** (`/patients-guests/patient-forms`) was the most effective strategy. The page clearly lists downloadable forms with descriptions. The **Medical Records page** (`/medical-records`) also links to the authorization form, but under a different URL (potentially an updated version).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.fishertitus.org/media/2025/07/Service-Documents_FTC24-5-Authorization-to-disclose-PHI.pdf
- **Found on:** Patient Forms page (`/patients-guests/patient-forms`)
- **Document type:** Authorization to Disclose PHI (Protected Health Information) — this is the primary ROI form
- **Pages:** 2
- **File size:** 158,608 bytes
- **Notes:** Comprehensive authorization form (Form #FTC24-5, revised 11/20/2024). Includes patient info, recipient info, treatment location checkboxes for Fisher-Titus facilities, purpose of request, detailed record type selection, format/delivery options (CD, flash drive, encrypted email, paper), sensitive information consent, revocation language, and 1-year auto-expiration.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.fishertitus.org/media/2025/07/Service-Documents_FTC11-4-Emergency-Medical-Authorization-OPT-11-16.pdf
- **Found on:** Patient Forms page (`/patients-guests/patient-forms`)
- **Document type:** Emergency Medical Authorization — NOT an ROI form
- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 25,283 bytes
- **Notes:** Form for parents/guardians to authorize emergency medical treatment for minor children. Form #FTC11-4, revised 3/6/12. Not related to release of information.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.fishertitus.org/media/2025/08/FTC24-5_Authorization_to_disclose_PHI_2.pdf
- **Found on:** Medical Records page (`/medical-records`), linked as "Medical Records Request Form"
- **Document type:** Authorization to Disclose PHI — same form type as form-1.pdf but a slightly different version
- **Pages:** 2
- **File size:** 166,110 bytes
- **Notes:** Same form number (FTC24-5) as form-1.pdf but with minor differences (e.g., "Occupational Health" listed under specialty offices instead of a duplicate "Behavioral Health" entry). Different MD5 hash confirms it's not identical. This version appears on the medical records page and may be a slightly updated revision.

## Difficulties
- **None significant.** The forms were easily accessible from the website with no bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-rendered download links. Both the Patient Forms page and Medical Records page are well-organized and clearly link to downloadable PDFs.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The form was found within 2 clicks from the homepage (Patients & Guests → Patient Forms), with clear labeling and direct PDF download links.

# OSU Wexner Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center
- **Website**: https://wexnermedical.osu.edu
- **Location**: Columbus, OH

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search**: Searched for "Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately found direct links to two PDF forms hosted on the Wexner Medical Center website.
2. **Site-specific search**: Confirmed via `site:wexnermedical.osu.edu medical records release form authorization` — same results, plus a link to the medical records information page.
3. The forms are linked from the [Medical Records page](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/-/media/files/wexnermedical/patient-care/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records/authorization-to-release-medical-information-112619.pdf
- **File size**: 231,492 bytes
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Authorization to Release Medical Information form. This is an **image-only scan** (no text layer). Created with "Global Graphics Harlequin RIP" — appears to be a scanned paper form. The filename suggests it was last updated 11/26/2019.
- **Initial impression**: This is the standalone ROI authorization form, but as an image-only scan it has no extractable text and no fillable fields.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/-/media/files/wexnermedical/patient-care/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records/roi-form-and-instructions.pdf
- **File size**: 206,282 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Description**: Combined ROI form with instructions. Page 1 contains detailed instructions for completing the form. Page 2 appears to contain the authorization form itself. Created with Adobe Acrobat Pro — has a full text layer.
- **Initial impression**: This is the more complete/useful version — it includes both instructions and the authorization form, with extractable text. The form includes checkboxes for specific record types (Emergency Dept Records, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, etc.), purpose of disclosure options, and facility selection. Requires wet ink signature or eSignature with date/time stamp.

## Difficulties
- **None significant**. The forms were easy to find via web search and directly linked from the organization's medical records page.
- form-1.pdf is an image-only scan with no text layer, which limits accessibility.
- The organization provides two versions: a standalone scanned form and a combined instructions+form document created in Adobe Acrobat Pro.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
Forms were found on the first web search attempt with direct download links. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues.

# DHR Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** DHR Health (formerly Doctors Hospital at Renaissance)
- **Location:** Edinburg, TX
- **Website:** https://dhrhealth.com

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search** for `DHR Health Edinburg TX "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found references to their medical records page and an older URL structure (`/app/uploads/2020/10/...`) that returned empty files.
2. **Web search** for `DHR Health Edinburg TX "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the medical records page URL.
3. **Direct website navigation** to https://dhrhealth.com/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/ — found the actual working download links under a "Download" section with English and Spanish options.

The initial URL from web search results (`/app/uploads/2020/10/AuthorizationToDiscloseMedicalInfo-DHRHealth-English.pdf`) returned an empty file. The actual working URLs were found by navigating the website directly using the browser.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://dhrhealth.com/media/q2dm5tx5/medical-records-form-english.pdf
- **File size:** 190,271 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" — English version. Still branded as "Doctors Hospital at Renaissance" (former name). Has text layer with extractable text. Includes checkboxes for type of access (copies vs. review), specific record types (cardiac studies, consult reports, discharge summary, operative reports, etc.), and sections for consent/non-consent regarding psychiatric records, substance abuse, and HIV information. Form number DSR-GEN-71, dated 08/15.
- **Initial impression:** This is the standard ROI/authorization form for DHR Health. It is a general release form (not patient-access-specific) — it authorizes disclosure either from or to the hospital. No fillable fields (flat PDF with text layer). Not a digital-first design.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://dhrhealth.com/media/2ldbyqpn/medical-records-form-spanish.pdf
- **File size:** 194,087 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** Spanish version of the same authorization form. This is an image-only scan (no extractable text, contains two scanned CCITT images at 300 DPI).
- **Initial impression:** Same ROI form as form-1.pdf but in Spanish. Image-only scan, so no text layer and no fillable fields.

## Difficulties
- The older URL path (`/app/uploads/2020/10/`) returned an empty file — DHR Health appears to have migrated their media URLs to a new CMS structure (`/media/{hash}/`).
- The form still uses the old name "Doctors Hospital at Renaissance" rather than the current "DHR Health" branding.
- The Spanish version is a scanned image with no text layer, making it less accessible than the English version.
- The medical records page was easy to find (2 clicks from homepage: Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and the download links were clearly visible on the page.

## Downloaded Forms

- **File size**: 135,599 bytes

- **Description**: "How To Complete the Form" (English) — color-coded instructional version of the same ROI form, with annotations explaining each section (e.g., "Enter your personal information in this section", "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider"). Same layout as form-1 but with added guidance.

### form-4.pdf

# Sturdy Memorial Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `Sturdy Memorial Hospital Attleboro MA "authorization" "release of information" medical records form filetype:pdf` — immediately found two direct PDF links on sturdyhealth.org.
2. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:sturdyhealth.org authorization release medical records form` — confirmed the same two forms.

The first search strategy was sufficient; no need to navigate the website manually.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **Bot blocking on curl**: Direct `curl` downloads (even with a realistic browser User-Agent) were blocked by the CDN (Akamai), returning "Access Denied" HTML responses instead of PDFs.
- **Chrome PDF viewer wrapper**: The Chrome DevTools `get_network_request` tool saved the Chrome PDF viewer HTML wrapper rather than the raw PDF bytes when saving from the PDF viewer page.
- **Workaround**: Used JavaScript `fetch()` within the browser page context to retrieve the raw PDF bytes, converted to base64, extracted in chunks, and decoded on disk. This successfully bypassed the bot protection since the browser session had valid cookies/headers.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.sturdyhealth.org/app/files/public/496be82f-b2a1-482b-ae18-dea3b5bdba8a/Authorization%20to%20Release%20Medical%20Records%20FILLABLE%20Jan%2025.pdf`
- **File size**: 221,430 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Initial impression**: Current fillable "Authorization to Release Health Information" form, dated Jan 2025 (form code SM00081 10/24). Includes patient info, authorizing provider, recipient, sensitive information categories (mental health, HIV/AIDS, STD, sexual assault, substance abuse, genetic testing), purpose of disclosure, types of records to release, and signature/revocation sections. This is the current, actively-used ROI form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.sturdyhealth.org/app/files/public/96f2cd1b-4b3f-4460-9ec1-a8eeacdc61a6/Medical-Records-Auth-Form.pdf`
- **File size**: 761,270 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Initial impression**: Older version of the same authorization form, titled "Sturdy Memorial Hospital/Mansfield Health Center — Authorization to Release Health Information". Similar content to form-1 but appears to be an older iteration (last modified Oct 2017 per HTTP headers). Larger file size suggests it may be a scanned or less-optimized PDF. Contains similar fields but with slightly different formatting and record type options (e.g., "SDC", "Sturdy Plus" clinic options).

# Montefiore Nyack Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Montefiore Nyack Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately found two direct PDF URLs on the official hospital website.
2. **Web search** for "Montefiore Nyack Hospital medical records release form PDF" — confirmed the same URLs.
3. **Site-specific search** for `site:montefiorenyack.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed form links and the Medical Records page.
4. **Navigated the website** to `https://www.montefiorenyack.org/manage-my-care/medical-records` — found the Medical Records page with a direct link to the authorization form under "Release of Medical Records" heading.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **Bot blocking via curl**: Direct `curl` downloads (even with a realistic browser User-Agent) returned "Access Denied" HTML pages (482–515 bytes). The site's CDN/WAF blocks automated requests.
- **Resolution**: Used Chrome DevTools browser environment to fetch the PDFs via JavaScript `fetch()` from within the browser session, then decoded the base64 content to disk. Both PDFs downloaded successfully this way.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.montefiorenyack.org/sites/default/files/MNH_HIPAA_AuthorizationForm%20Rev%2001.2022FN.pdf`
- **File size**: 353,152 bytes
- **Description**: "Montefiore Nyack Hospital Authorization for Release of Health Information" — revised 01/2022. This is the current version linked from the Medical Records page. It is a multi-page PDF with a text layer (not a scan). The form covers patient self-requests, attorney requests, and third-party requests. Includes sections for specifying record types (ER, inpatient, outpatient, images, billing), sensitive information consent (alcohol/drug, mental health, HIV), expiration (default 180 days), and revocation rights. Contact info: fax 845-348-8433, email MNH-ROI@montefiorenyack.org.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.montefiorenyack.org/sites/default/files/New%20Release%20of%20Information%20Authorization%20Form%2010.20.21.pdf`
- **File size**: 70,455 bytes
- **Description**: An older version of the same "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, dated 10/20/2021. Content is very similar to form-1 but in a single-page layout. This version is not currently linked from the Medical Records page (form-1 is the current version) but remains accessible at its URL. Found via web search results referencing the alternate URL.

## Summary

The form was easy to find — a single web search or one click from the Medical Records page. The hospital publishes a clear, dedicated ROI/HIPAA authorization form. The only technical challenge was bot blocking on direct downloads, which required browser-based retrieval.

# Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital
- **Location**: Fairfield, OH
- **Website**: https://www.mercy.com/locations/hospitals/cincinnati/mercy-health-fairfield-hospital
- **Parent System**: Bon Secours Mercy Health (major nonprofit system)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Mercy Health Ohio medical records release form PDF authorization" — immediately returned the Mercy Health medical records request page and a direct link to the Cincinnati-region authorization form PDF.
2. **Visited the Mercy Health medical records request page** at https://www.mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests — found two versions of the authorization form (English and Spanish), plus information about MyChart and online eRequest options via Ciox/Datavant.

The parent system (Mercy Health / mercy.com) manages medical records centrally. Fairfield Hospital is explicitly listed as a checkbox option on the Cincinnati-region form, and the medical records page lists a dedicated fax number for Fairfield (513-599-4491).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/cincinnati.ashx
- **File size**: 312,932 bytes (313 KB)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION" — Cincinnati-region specific form. Has full text layer with extractable text. Lists Mercy Health Cincinnati hospitals as checkboxes (Anderson, Clermont, Fairfield, Jewish, West). Includes sections for patient info, dates of service, specific records to disclose, recipient, delivery format (paper or electronic PDF/CD), and purpose of disclosure. References HIPAA § 164.524. Revision date: MHP 0786 Rev 1/19.
- **Initial impression**: This is the primary ROI/authorization form applicable to Fairfield Hospital. It is a proper authorization form with a text layer, though it does not appear to have fillable form fields.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/mh-authorization-22024.ashx
- **File size**: 151,891 bytes (152 KB)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Updated/newer system-wide authorization form (filename suggests 2024 revision). Almost entirely image-based with minimal extractable text ("1ROI" and "Printed: 2024-01-17 08:19 MHP0786.dcl"). Contains a large scanned image (2550x3300 pixels at 300 DPI). This appears to be a scanned version of a similar or updated authorization form.
- **Initial impression**: This is the current version of the ROI form linked from the medical records page under "Medical Records Request Forms (English)". It is an image-only scan with no usable text layer.

## Difficulties
- **No major difficulties** — the form was easy to find via both web search and navigating the Mercy Health website.
- The current "official" form (form-2.pdf) linked from the medical records page is an image-only scan, which is a significant accessibility limitation compared to the older Cincinnati-specific form (form-1.pdf) which has a full text layer.
- The older Cincinnati-specific form URL (cincinnati.ashx) still works but is not directly linked from the current medical records page; the page now links to the newer system-wide form.

## Additional Notes
- Mercy Health also offers medical records requests via **MyChart** (patient portal) and an **online eRequest** system through Ciox/Datavant (https://www.swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html).
- Spanish version of the form is also available at: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/mh-authorization-spanish-22024.ashx
- Authorization expires after 1 year for Ohio & Kentucky, 60 days for Michigan.

# Boulder Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF**: Searched `Boulder Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct hit for BMC specifically, but pointed toward their website.
2. **Web search for medical records release**: Searched `Boulder Medical Center Boulder CO "medical records" "release form"` — found their Medical Records Department page at `https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/departments/medical-records/`.
3. **Website navigation**: Fetched the Medical Records page directly. The form is clearly linked under "Option 2: Complete and Return the Form" with a direct PDF download link.

## What Worked

The second web search immediately identified the correct page. The form is directly linked from the Medical Records department page — no deep navigation required. The PDF downloaded cleanly with curl (no bot blocking or JavaScript rendering needed).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BMC-Record-Release-Form.pdf`
- **File size**: 59,672 bytes

The form mentions a 180-day expiration from signature date, notes that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing, and references the BMC Notice of Privacy Practices for revocation. Form ID: AUTH001a, Rev 01.2019.

## Difficulties

- None. The form was easy to find and download. It was clearly linked from the medical records page.
- The website also mentions two other ways to request records: (1) an online form via Swellbox for records before September 9, 2024, and (2) the MyChart "Sharing Hub" for records after September 9, 2024. Only the PDF release form was downloaded as it is the traditional ROI authorization form.

# Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center: ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center
- **Location**: Springfield, OH
- **Website**: https://www.mercy.com/locations/hospitals/springfield/mercy-health-springfield-regional-medical-center
- **Parent System**: Bon Secours Mercy Health (mercy.com)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Mercy Health Springfield Regional Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found the main medical records request page and a direct PDF link from mercy.net (which turned out to be a different Mercy system).
2. **Web search** for `Mercy Health Springfield Ohio "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the mercy.com medical records page and found additional form URLs.
3. **Web search** for `site:mercy.com "authorization" "release of information" filetype:pdf` — found the Youngstown-specific authorization form.
4. **Navigated** to https://www.mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests — the central medical records request page. Found the system-wide authorization form link (English and Spanish) and Springfield-specific contact info.
5. **URL pattern probing** — tested location-specific URLs at `mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/{location}.ashx` and discovered a Springfield-specific authorization form exists alongside Youngstown, Toledo, Cincinnati, and Lima versions.

## Key Findings

The medical records request page (https://www.mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests) offers three options:
1. **MyChart** — request records through the patient portal
2. **eRequest** — online request via Ciox/Datavant partner (https://www.swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html) — covers Springfield
3. **Paper form** — download and submit authorization form by mail, fax, or email

Springfield-specific contact info:
- Email: MercyROI@datavant.com
- Phone: 844-835-1238
- Fax: 513-599-4503

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mercy.net/content/dam/mercy/en/pdf/Mercy-Patients-Request-to-Access-Protected-Health-Information-Form_920.pdf
- **Document type**: Patient's Request to Access Protected Health Information
- **Pages**: 2
- **Text layer**: Yes (full text extractable)
- **Notes**: This form is from **mercy.net** (Mercy, the Missouri-based health system), NOT from mercy.com (Bon Secours Mercy Health, the Ohio system that operates Springfield Regional). The web search returned this as a result, but it belongs to a different organization. Kept per study protocol. This is a patient-access-specific form with good format options (paper, PDF email, CD, MyMercy Portal, secure/unsecure email, fax, mail, personal pick-up).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/youngstown.ashx
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information (Youngstown-specific)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Text layer**: Yes (full text extractable)
- **Notes**: From the correct Mercy Health (mercy.com) system, but this version is specific to the Youngstown region (lists St. Elizabeth Boardman Hospital, St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, St. Joseph Warren Hospital). Same general format as the Springfield version but with different facility names. Form number MHP 0782 Rev 1/19.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/mh-authorization-22024.ashx
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information (system-wide, 2024 version)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Text layer**: No (image-only scan, grayscale 2550x3300 at 300 DPI)
- **Notes**: This is the form currently linked on the medical records request page as the system-wide "Medical Records Request Forms" (English version). It is an image-only scan with virtually no extractable text. Printed date shown: 2024-01-17. Despite being the currently-linked version on the website, it is less accessible than the location-specific text-based versions.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/springfield.ashx
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information (Springfield-specific)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Text layer**: Yes (full text extractable)
- **Notes**: **This is the most relevant form.** Springfield-specific version that explicitly lists "Springfield Regional Medical Center" and "Urbana Hospital" as facility options. Form number MHP 0785 Rev 1/19. Contains checkboxes for record types, options for self or third-party disclosure, format choices (paper or electronic PDF/CD), and delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email). References 45 CFR § 164.524. Authorization expires one year from date (Ohio). Not directly linked on the website (the system-wide image-only version is linked instead), but accessible via predictable URL pattern.

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **Two "Mercy" systems confusion**: Web searches conflated mercy.com (Bon Secours Mercy Health, Ohio) with mercy.net (Mercy, Missouri). The initial PDF result was from the wrong system.
2. **Image-only scan**: The system-wide form currently linked on the website (form-3.pdf) is an image-only scan with no extractable text, making it less accessible than the location-specific versions.
3. **Hidden location-specific forms**: The Springfield-specific form (form-4.pdf) is not directly linked on the medical records page. Only the system-wide image-only version is linked. The location-specific versions are discoverable only by guessing URL patterns.
4. **Form age**: The text-based Springfield form (MHP 0785) was revised 1/19 (January 2019), while the image-only system-wide version appears to be from 2024 — suggesting they may have scanned a newer version but didn't provide a text-based PDF.

# Ascension St. Vincent's East — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for facility-specific form**: Searched for `Ascension St. Vincent's East Birmingham Alabama "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`. Did not yield a direct link to the facility-specific form but revealed that Ascension uses regional forms.

2. **Web search for Ascension system-wide forms**: Searched for `Ascension "medical records" "release form" "authorization" PDF download`. Found several regional Ascension forms (Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas, Wisconsin, Michigan) but not Alabama-specific.

3. **Web search for Alabama-specific form**: Searched for `Ascension St. Vincent's Alabama medical records request form PDF authorization release`. This found the direct PDF link to the Alabama authorization form on healthcare.ascension.org.

4. **Web search for UAB St. Vincent's forms**: Ascension St. Vincent's has recently been rebranded/merged with UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Searched `uabstvincents.org medical records request form authorization PDF download` and found a newer January 2026 form on the UAB St. Vincent's website.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://healthcare.ascension.org/-/media/project/ascension/healthcare/legacy/markets/alabama/documents/stvincents-documents/authorization_to_disclose_protected_health_information_feb-2022.pdf
- **File size**: 2,918,679 bytes (~2.8 MB)
- **Document type**: Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information
- **Description**: Ascension St. Vincent's branded ROI form (revised February 2022). 2-page form with fields for TO/FROM facility, patient demographics, record type checkboxes (facesheet, discharge summary, H&P, ED record, consultation, operative report, etc.), purpose of disclosure, and signature blocks. Includes options for pickup, US mail, or electronic delivery via email. References CFR 164.524 (right to inspect/copy). Has external-use section for identity verification (driver's license, SSN, notarized signature, etc.). This appears to be the legacy Ascension-era form, now likely superseded by the UAB version.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://uabstvincents.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2026/01/UAB-Hospital-STV-Authorization-for-Use-or-Disclosure-of-Patient-Info-Jan-2026.pdf
- **File size**: 143,348 bytes (~140 KB)
- **Document type**: Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records
- **Description**: UAB St. Vincent's branded ROI form (February 2026). 2-page form. Includes checkbox for patient's personal use vs. third-party release. Lists specific UAB St. Vincent's locations including "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department". Offers multiple record type options (key clinical notes, entire medical record, specific reports). Delivery options include paper (mailed or pickup), fax, CD, or email with encryption notice. Includes initialing requirements for revocation rights and non-conditioning of treatment. 6-month default expiration. This is the current, most relevant form for this facility.

## Difficulties

- The facility is part of the Ascension system, which recently partnered with/was rebranded to UAB St. Vincent's. This means there are two different forms from two different eras.
- The older Ascension form (form-1.pdf) is much larger (~2.8 MB vs ~140 KB), likely because it contains embedded images/scanned elements.
- The newer UAB form (form-2.pdf) is cleaner, smaller, and appears to be a digital-first document.
- No difficulty with download — both PDFs were directly accessible via curl without bot blocking.

# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `"Lakeland Regional Health" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — this immediately returned two direct PDF URLs on mylrh.org.
2. **Site-scoped search**: Searched `site:mylrh.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records page at https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/.
3. **Medical Records page review**: Fetched the medical records page directly, which links to a 2022 version of the authorization form (different URL than the 2018 version found via search), plus a digital intake option via Swellbox.

## URLs and Downloads

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mylrh.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Authorization-to-Use-or-Disclose-PHI-1.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information (ROI form)
- **Notes**: Older version (dated LRH 04/16). 1 page, ~463 KB. Full text layer. Offers Paper or Electronic delivery options. Includes checkboxes for specific record types (abstracts, lab reports, operative reports, radiology, billing, etc.). References Florida Statute 395.3025 for fees. Authorization valid for 6 months. Includes redaction option for mental health/substance abuse/HIV.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mylrh.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Release-Authorization-Form.pdf
- **Document type**: LRH Physicians Group Release/Authorization Form
- **Notes**: This is primarily an insurance assignment and general authorization form for the physician group practice, not a patient-initiated ROI form. It covers authorization to release information to insurance carriers, Medicare/Medicaid assignment, financial responsibility, and consent to treatment. Not the same as a patient records request form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mylrh.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Authorization-to-Use-or-Disclose-PHI.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information (ROI form — current version)
- **Notes**: Updated version (dated LRH 01/22, ~87 KB). This is the version currently linked from the Medical Records page. Nearly identical to form-1 but adds "MyChart Patient Portal" as a delivery option alongside Paper and Electronic. This appears to be the current/active version of the ROI form.

## Difficulties

- No significant difficulties. Forms were easily discoverable via web search and directly linked from the medical records page.
- The organization also offers an electronic intake system via Swellbox (http://www.swellbox.com/lakeland-wizard.html) as an alternative to the PDF form.
- Two versions of the hospital ROI form exist at different URLs (2018 upload vs 2022 upload); the 2022 version is the one currently linked from the medical records page.

## Summary

Lakeland Regional Health makes their ROI form readily available. The current form (form-3.pdf) is a single-page, text-based PDF with delivery options including Paper, Electronic (email), and MyChart Patient Portal. The physician group has a separate form (form-2.pdf) that is more of an insurance/billing authorization than a patient records release form.

# The Iowa Clinic — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** The Iowa Clinic
- **Website:** https://www.iowaclinic.com
- **Location:** West Des Moines, IA
- **Type:** Physician practice, independent, for-profit

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web searches (partially successful)
- `"The Iowa Clinic" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No direct PDF results
- `"The Iowa Clinic" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — No direct PDF results
- `site:iowaclinic.com authorization release medical records` — Found the medical records page URL
- `"The Iowa Clinic" "release of information" form authorization download` — Found pdfFiller reference and Executive Health form page

### 2. Website navigation (no downloadable PDF found)
- Navigated to https://www.iowaclinic.com/for-patients/payment-billing/medical-records/
- Page has four sections: Request Records from Us, Request Imaging Records, For Healthcare Providers, For Third-Party Organizations
- **No downloadable PDF forms** — all records requests are handled via online web forms:
  - Patient requests: Datavant/Swellbox Health Record Wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/iowa-clinic-wizard.html)
  - Imaging records: Formstack-powered web form on iowaclinic.com
  - Healthcare providers: Swellbox wizard
  - Third-party organizations: SmartRequest portal (https://smartrequest.com)
- Also found Executive Health Medical Record Release Form page — another Formstack web form
- Old URL (medical-records-old/medical-record-request-form/) contains an older Formstack-based authorization form

### 3. Wayback Machine archive search (successful)
- Searched `web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx` for PDFs hosted on iowaclinic.com
- Found two archived authorization PDFs that were previously available at `/static/docs/`:
  - `Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf` (archived 2015-07-23)
  - `medical-records-release-form.pdf` (archived 2012 and 2016)
- Both URLs return 404 on the live site — PDFs have been removed in favor of online forms

### 4. Direct URL probing (unsuccessful)
- Tried various common paths (`/content/cms/files/`, `/forms/`, `/pdf/`, etc.) — all 404

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://web.archive.org/web/2015/http://www.iowaclinic.com/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf
- **Original URL:** http://www.iowaclinic.com/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf (now 404)
- **File size:** 69,082 bytes
- **What it is:** "Authorization for Release of Information from The Iowa Clinic P.C." — This is the newer/updated version of the ROI form. Single-page, well-formatted layout with checkboxes for record types and purpose of release. Includes sections for sensitive information opt-out (substance abuse, genetics, mental health, AIDS). Has text layer, not a scan.
- **Note:** This appears to be a more polished, professionally designed version compared to form-2.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://web.archive.org/web/2016/http://www.iowaclinic.com/static/docs/medical-records-release-form.pdf
- **Original URL:** http://www.iowaclinic.com/static/docs/medical-records-release-form.pdf (now 404)
- **File size:** 76,365 bytes
- **What it is:** "Authorization for Release of Information from The Iowa Clinic, P.C." — An older version (dated October 2012) of the same ROI form. Two pages. Includes a dedicated second page for "Specific Authorization for Release of Information protected by State or Federal Law concerning Mental Health, Substance Abuse Treatment or AIDS-Related Information." References 42 CFR Part 2 and Iowa Code Chapter 228 and 141(A). Has text layer but uses many tab/space characters for formatting.

## Difficulties Encountered
1. **No current downloadable PDF forms** — The Iowa Clinic has fully transitioned to online web-based forms (Swellbox/Datavant, Formstack, SmartRequest). There are no PDF downloads available on their current website.
2. **Multiple third-party platforms** — Different request types route to different vendor platforms (Swellbox for patients/providers, SmartRequest for third parties, Formstack for executive health).
3. **Archived forms only** — The only downloadable PDF authorization forms were found via the Wayback Machine from 2012-2016. These were previously hosted at `/static/docs/` but have since been removed.

## Summary
The Iowa Clinic no longer offers downloadable PDF authorization forms. All medical records requests are now handled through online web forms via third-party platforms (Datavant/Swellbox, Formstack, SmartRequest). Two historical PDF versions of their "Authorization for Release of Information" form were retrieved from the Wayback Machine archive. These represent the forms that were in use approximately 2012-2015.
