# Best Practices in Healthcare ROI Forms: A Cross-Study Analysis

## Introduction

Under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), patients have a legal right to obtain copies of their health information. In practice, that right begins with a form — and the design of that form determines whether the experience feels like exercising a right or begging a favor. Across roughly 200 organizations evaluated in this study, spanning teaching hospitals, critical access facilities, FQHCs, and physician practices in every census region, a small but instructive cohort demonstrates that patient-centered records access is achievable at any scale, in any setting, and under any ownership model. This analysis synthesizes findings across all study batches to identify the design choices, structural decisions, and organizational commitments that distinguish the best from the rest.

## The Foundational Choice: Dedicated Patient Access Forms

The single strongest predictor of a high-quality patient experience is whether an organization maintains a **dedicated form for patient self-access**, separate from its third-party authorization form. Roughly 75% of organizations in this study funnel patients through generic third-party authorization forms — documents designed for attorneys, insurers, and other requesting parties — forcing patients to write their own name in a "recipient" field on a form that was never designed for them. The organizations that get this right consistently outperform their peers across every evaluation dimension.

**Barnes-Jewish Hospital** (BJC HealthCare, St. Louis) sets the standard. Its "Request for Access to Protected Health Information by Individual Patients" form is completely separate from its third-party authorization, and the hospital's Medical Records website explicitly categorizes "Individual requests" apart from "Third-party requests." The form uses right-of-access language ("requesting access") rather than authorization language — the legally correct framing under § 164.524. An "Abstract" checkbox bundles all record types into a single selection, sparing patients from navigating thirteen individual checkboxes.

**Northwell Health** (New York) takes the structural separation further with a form that opens by citing **HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524** directly on the document. This is more than a legal footnote — it reframes the interaction. When a form cites the patient's legal right of access, the implicit message shifts from "we are granting you permission" to "you are exercising a right." The form's "To me" checkbox as the first recipient option reinforces this framing.

**Intermountain Health** (Utah) demonstrates how language design can make a dedicated form genuinely approachable. Its patient form replaces bureaucratic section headers with **question-based prompts** — "What records do you want?" and "How do you want your records delivered?" — that guide patients conversationally through the process. Combined with a single-page layout, 48 fillable fields, and email submission, the form makes a bureaucratic process feel manageable.

**UAB Hospital** (Birmingham, AL) innovates with a **five-tier graduated record package system** that lets patients choose scope without understanding medical record taxonomy. Most patients don't know the difference between an H&P and a progress note; UAB's curated bundles respect that reality while still offering granular control for patients who want it.

These organizations share a common insight: a patient requesting their own records is doing something fundamentally different from a third party requesting disclosure, and the form should reflect that difference.

## Digital-First Design: Fillable Fields and Online Pathways

Fillable PDF fields remain surprisingly uncommon — only about a quarter of organizations offer any interactive form elements — yet they represent the single highest-impact technical improvement most organizations could make. The gap between a born-digital PDF with zero fillable fields and one with interactive inputs is the difference between a digital document and a piece of paper that happens to be stored electronically.

**Flowers Hospital** (Dothan, AL), a for-profit CHS facility in rural Alabama, earned the study's highest individual score (4.65) with a 66-field fillable PDF built in Adobe InDesign. Every checkbox and text input is interactive, enabling full digital completion. A Swellbox online portal provides an alternative fully digital pathway. That a mid-size for-profit hospital in rural Alabama achieves what many academic medical centers do not underscores that this is a matter of organizational intent, not resources.

**Olmsted Medical Center** (Rochester, MN), a 61-bed independent practice, delivers a single-page fillable PDF with 62 interactive fields — genuinely digital-first design from a small independent facility. **Yale New Haven Health** leads on raw field count with 97 fillable fields, and **A.O. Fox Hospital / Bassett Healthcare** (Oneonta, NY) packs 83 fillable fields into two pages while defaulting delivery to its MyBassett patient portal.

But fillable fields alone don't solve the end-to-end problem. Many organizations invest in interactive PDFs but still require printing for a wet signature, then faxing or mailing — negating the digital design. **Labette Health** (Parsons, KS), a small independent community hospital, leapfrogged peers by deploying a **Formstack online workflow** with electronic signature, photo ID upload, and email delivery. No printing, no mailing, no faxing. For a facility of this size, the fully digital no-paper workflow is genuinely innovative and proves that digital-first design is not limited to large systems with big IT budgets.

**Advocate Health** models a complementary approach: its forms open with a prominent portal callout — *"Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal?"* — establishing a portal-first, form-second, paper-third hierarchy that nudges patients toward the fastest fulfillment channel while preserving alternatives.

## Language Access and Community Responsiveness

Multilingual form availability correlates with community awareness, not organizational size. Some of the most linguistically responsive organizations are among the smallest in the study.

**Broward Health** (South Florida) offers its ROI form in **English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese** — four languages reflecting genuine attention to the community's diversity. **Prevea Health** (Wisconsin) matches this with four languages including **Hmong and Somali**, responsive to Wisconsin's refugee communities. **Olmsted Medical Center** offers forms in English, Spanish, and **Somali** — notably responsive to Rochester, Minnesota's significant Somali population. **Memorial Healthcare System** (Hollywood, FL) provides **English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole** versions alongside a two-business-day processing commitment — the fastest turnaround observed in the study.

Translation quality matters as much as availability. The best bilingual forms — Flowers Hospital's HIM-1406S, Merit Health Central's Spanish version, Samaritan Health Services' bilingual EHI export form — provide **co-equal translations** with identical field counts and structure. The worst leave footers, contact blocks, and legal disclaimers in English, undermining the translation effort and signaling that the Spanish version is an afterthought.

**Cherokee Health Systems / River Valley Health** (Knoxville, TN), an FQHC, goes beyond translation to provide **color-coded bilingual instructional guides** that overlay plain-language annotations on the authorization form, translating bureaucratic headers like "Release Information From" into clear instructions. For an FQHC serving underserved populations, this investment in comprehension — not just translation, but explanation — demonstrates genuine commitment to equitable access.

## Innovation from Unexpected Places

Some of the study's most forward-looking practices come from the smallest and most resource-constrained facilities.

**Wayne County Hospital** (Monticello, KY), a 25-bed critical access hospital in rural Kentucky, offers both a downloadable PDF and an **online HTML web form** — an exceptional dual-pathway approach for a facility its size. The form prints Kentucky's KRS 422.317 free-copy disclosure directly on the document, providing on-form fee transparency that larger systems routinely omit.

**Samaritan Health Services** (Lebanon, OR), parent of a 25-bed community hospital, publishes a **dedicated "Computer Readable EHI Export Request" form** — a separate document for patients wanting machine-readable health data under the 21st Century Cures Act. This form exists in both English and Spanish. The standard ROI form commits to "No Charge" for initial patient requests. That a small regional system offers an EHI export pathway while most major teaching hospitals have not yet translated interoperability requirements into patient-facing processes is striking.

**Fallon Medical Complex** (Baker, MT), a 25-bed critical access hospital in eastern Montana, offers **seven record delivery formats**: paper mail, USB drive, CD, electronic fax, in-person review, unencrypted email with informed consent, and patient portal access, with the first copy free. For one of the most remote communities in the continental United States, this breadth of delivery options ensures that geography is not a barrier to format choice.

**Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin** defaults delivery to **encrypted email** — a privacy-by-design choice that treats security as the baseline rather than an opt-in — with a stated **five-business-day processing time**, far exceeding HIPAA's 30-day requirement.

## Fee Transparency and Compliance Signaling

The best organizations don't just comply with fee rules — they make compliance visible to patients. **UCHealth** (University of Colorado Hospital) explicitly states that patient self-access is **free via portal and free for paper up to 100 pages** — a rare concrete commitment. **Samaritan Health Services** structures fees in three tiers: "Initial Patient Request: No Charge," "Continuing Care: No Charge," and fees only for third-party requests. **Merit Health Central** prints a footer acknowledging: *"This Healthcare Facility recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information."* These declarations transform fee policy from fine print into a visible organizational commitment.

UCHealth also includes a **post-Dobbs reproductive healthcare warning** alerting patients to litigation risks associated with certain record disclosures — a rare example of real-time responsiveness to the evolving legal environment.

## What the Best Forms Share

Across all batches, the highest-performing organizations share three structural traits:

1. **They designed the form for the patient, not the institution.** Dedicated patient access forms, question-based headers, conversational language, and "Myself" as the first recipient option all signal that patient self-access is the primary use case — not an edge case accommodated by a generic form.

2. **They offer electronic alternatives at every step.** Fillable fields for completion, email or portal for submission, and electronic delivery formats for fulfillment. The best organizations eliminate paper from the entire workflow; the next tier at least eliminates it from one or two steps.

3. **They use plain language and provide guidance.** Northwell's annotated instruction documents, Cherokee Health's color-coded guides, Intermountain's question-based headers, and Owensboro Health's companion instruction sheet with a help phone number all address a basic reality: most patients have never filled out an ROI form before and shouldn't need a health information management degree to do so.

## Recommendations

Based on the practices observed across this study, organizations seeking to improve patient access to health records should prioritize these actions, roughly in order of impact:

1. **Create a dedicated patient self-access form.** Separate it from the third-party authorization. Title it "Patient Request for Health Information" or similar. List "Myself" as the first recipient. Do not require a purpose-of-release statement for patient requests. This single structural decision is the strongest differentiator observed in the study.

2. **Make the PDF fillable.** Every text field, every checkbox, every date field should be interactive. Add Print and Clear buttons. This is a one-time investment that transforms every subsequent patient interaction. Organizations using Adobe InDesign, Acrobat, or similar tools can achieve 50+ fillable fields on a single-page form.

3. **Offer at least one fully electronic submission pathway.** Whether through a Formstack-style web form, email submission, or portal integration, eliminate the requirement to print, sign with ink, and mail or fax. Accept electronic signatures.

4. **Provide delivery format choice.** At minimum: patient portal, email (with encryption option), and paper mail. Organizations serving remote populations should consider USB/CD options. Default to the fastest secure channel (portal or encrypted email).

5. **Translate forms for your community.** Identify the top two or three non-English languages in your service area and provide co-equal translations — same structure, same field count, same quality. A partial translation is worse than none if it signals that non-English speakers are an afterthought.

6. **State fees on the form itself.** If patient self-access is free (as HIPAA's cost-based standard often makes it), say so explicitly. Vague "there may be a fee" language creates unnecessary anxiety and may deter requests.

7. **Publish a companion instruction document.** Annotated examples, plain-language explanations of each section, and a help phone number address health literacy barriers that form design alone cannot solve.

These practices are not aspirational ideals drawn from hypothetical best cases. Every recommendation above is already implemented by at least one real organization in this study — including 25-bed critical access hospitals, small-town FQHCs, and rural for-profit facilities. The barrier is not resources or technology. It is organizational attention to the patient experience at the moment a person decides to exercise their legal right to their own health information.
