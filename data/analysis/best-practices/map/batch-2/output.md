# Best Practices — Batch 2

## Standout Organizations

### Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) — The Gold Standard for Patient Self-Access Forms

Intermountain Health earns the highest overall score in this batch (4.4/5) and deserves it. Their dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" form is a model other systems should study. What sets it apart is the **question-based section headings** — instead of bureaucratic labels like "Section 3: Record Type Selection," patients see conversational prompts that guide them through the form naturally. The form is a single page with 48 fillable fields and Print/Clear buttons, meaning a patient can complete the entire process digitally. Crucially, Intermountain maintains a **separate third-party authorization form**, so patients requesting their own records never encounter fields designed for attorneys or insurers. Email submission is accepted, creating a fully digital pathway from completion to delivery.

**Why this matters**: When a patient sees a form designed *for them* rather than repurposed from an institutional disclosure workflow, the implicit message is "we expected you to ask for this." That framing reduces anxiety and confusion.

### UAB Hospital (Birmingham, AL) — Graduated Record Packages

UAB matches Intermountain's 4.4 overall score with a distinctly innovative approach: a **five-tier graduated record package system** that lets patients choose scope without needing to understand medical record taxonomy. Rather than presenting 20+ checkboxes for individual record types, UAB offers curated bundles. The form opens with a rights-affirming statement, and the website cleanly separates "Patient Request own medical records" from "Authorization" (third-party release). The dedicated patient form has 51 fillable fields with multiple electronic delivery options including email, CD, and fax.

**Why this matters**: Most patients don't know the difference between an H&P and a progress note. Package-based selection respects that reality while still giving granular control to patients who want it.

### Phelps Hospital / Northwell Health (Sleepy Hollow, NY) — Best Structural Design

Northwell Health's dual-form architecture is the clearest example of pathway differentiation in this batch. The patient access form is titled "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative" and **opens by citing HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524)** — framing the request as an exercise of legal rights rather than a permission grant. A "To me" checkbox makes self-access concrete. The companion instruction document provides **annotated visual examples with sample data**, dramatically lowering the completion barrier. The delivery options grid — pairing manner (mail, pickup, email, fax) with format (paper, USB, CD, secure email) — is the most structured and clear presentation of delivery choices in the batch.

**Why this matters**: When a form cites the patient's legal right of access, it shifts the power dynamic. The patient is exercising a right, not asking a favor.

### Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital (Lebanon, OR) — Rare EHI Export Form

Samaritan Health Services, a 25-bed community hospital's parent system, offers something almost no other organization in the study provides: a **dedicated "Computer Readable EHI Export Request" form** in both English and Spanish. This form exists specifically for patients who want their records in a machine-readable format — a right established by the 21st Century Cures Act. The standard ROI form also commits to **"No Charge" for initial patient requests** and offers six delivery formats including MyChart and email.

**Why this matters**: The EHI export form demonstrates awareness of modern interoperability requirements that most health systems — including those many times Samaritan's size — have not yet translated into patient-facing processes.

### Cherokee Health Systems / River Valley Health (Knoxville, TN) — Bilingual Instructional Guides

This independent FQHC provides **color-coded instructional guides** that overlay plain-language annotations on the authorization form, explaining each section in accessible terms. Both the form and the guides are available in English and Spanish — not bilingual summaries, but complete standalone documents. The guides translate bureaucratic headers like "Release Information From" into clear instructions like "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider."

**Why this matters**: For an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations, the investment in annotated bilingual guides demonstrates genuine commitment to comprehension — not just translation, but explanation.

### Wayne County Hospital (Monticello, KY) — Small Hospital, Big Innovation

This 25-bed critical access hospital in rural Kentucky punches well above its weight. It offers a **parallel online web form** at `/Release-of-Health-Form` alongside its PDF — rare for any critical access hospital. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" with "self" listed first, and it prints Kentucky's **KRS 422.317 free-copy disclosure** directly on the form — unusually transparent fee communication. Email is offered as a delivery option.

**Why this matters**: Wayne County proves that patient-centered design isn't a function of budget or bed count. A 25-bed rural facility can offer an online submission pathway when patient access is prioritized.

### Fallon Medical Complex (Baker, MT) — Seven Delivery Formats from Rural Montana

This 25-bed critical access hospital in eastern Montana offers **seven record delivery formats**: paper mail, USB drive, CD, electronic fax, in-person review, unencrypted email with informed consent, and patient portal access. The form explicitly states patients may receive their **first copy free**. For a hospital serving one of the most remote communities in the continental United States, this breadth of delivery options is remarkable.

## Patterns Across This Batch

The clearest signal is that **dedicated patient access forms correlate with the highest scores** — Intermountain, UAB, Phelps/Northwell, and UTMB all maintain separate patient and third-party forms and all score B or above. Only 5 of ~45 organizations in this batch differentiate the two pathways. The most innovative practices come from unexpected places: a 25-bed Kentucky hospital offers online submission, a rural Montana facility offers seven delivery formats, and an Oregon regional system publishes an EHI export form. Teaching hospitals and major systems have technical polish (fillable fields, multiple languages) but often lack the structural decision to create a dedicated patient pathway. The best forms share three traits: they use plain language, they were designed for the patient (not repurposed from institutional workflows), and they offer electronic alternatives at every step.
