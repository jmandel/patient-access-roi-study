# Synthesis: Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix

## Overview

Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix is part of Banner Health, a major nonprofit health system in the western United States. The facility uses Banner Health's system-wide forms for medical records release rather than maintaining its own. Two forms were found: a current system-wide authorization (form-1.pdf, revised 06/2025) and a legacy hospital-specific version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/2017). The current system-wide form is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Banner Health offers two pathways for record access: a downloadable PDF authorization form and a patient portal (Banner Health App / https://account.bannerhealth.com/). The current form (form-1.pdf) prominently notes at the top that patients can access most health information through the portal, which is a helpful redirect before a patient commits to the paper process. For records not available through the portal, the PDF form is the primary pathway. Submission options include mail, fax, and in-person pick-up — fax provides an adequate electronic submission method, though there is no online form submission or email-based submission option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Banner Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" documents designed to cover all release scenarios. The current form includes a "Self" checkbox under both the "Release/Send Information To" field and the "Purpose" field, acknowledging that patients may request their own records, but the form structure, language, and authorization requirements are identical regardless of who the records are going to. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same release-from/release-to paradigm, date range fields, record type checkboxes, and HIPAA authorization language that a third party would face. There is no simplified patient access request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A straightforward web search returned the system-wide form immediately, and it is published on bannerhealth.com under the patients/medical-records section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA was encountered. Both forms were directly downloadable via curl. The coexistence of the current (2025) and legacy (2017) forms on the same website creates a minor risk that patients might download the outdated version, which lacks the portal callout and has less granular sensitive-information controls.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a flat, non-fillable PDF — zero interactive form fields despite being a born-digital document. A patient must print the form, handwrite all fields, sign it, and submit via mail, fax, or in-person. The form is 2 pages with approximately 20 fields to complete (patient demographics, release from/to addresses, date range, record type checkboxes, delivery preference, purpose, and signature). The layout is logically organized with clear section headers and a natural top-to-bottom flow. Record-type selection is granular with 12 specific categories plus an "Other" option.

Language is mixed: the opening paragraph about "third-party directives" is dense regulatory jargon that would confuse most patients, but the authorization statements on page 2 use accessible "I understand" framing. The sensitive information section uses an exclusion model — all sensitive data is included by default, with checkboxes to opt specific categories out. This is more protective than the legacy form's blanket consent but may still surprise patients who don't realize they must affirmatively opt out.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: The form warns "There may be a FEE associated with your Request for Records" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access fees (capped under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. This vagueness may deter patients from making requests.

**Liability waiver**: The form includes a broad release of Banner Health from "any legal responsibility or liability for the disclosure" — a clause that goes beyond standard HIPAA authorization requirements.

**No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature (or legal representative), which is appropriate.

**No in-person requirement**: Fax submission is available, so patients are not forced to visit the facility.

## Strengths

- **Patient portal callout**: The prominent opening line directing patients to the portal is a best practice that may eliminate the need for the paper form entirely for many patients.
- **Recent revision**: The 06/2025 revision date demonstrates active form maintenance.
- **Granular record selection**: 12 specific record categories give patients meaningful control.
- **Sensitive information opt-out**: Per-category exclusion checkboxes improve on the blanket consent approach.
- **Clear patient rights language**: Explicit statements about the right to refuse, non-conditioning of treatment, and right to revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Banner Health provides a findable, recently maintained, and reasonably well-designed authorization form, but it falls short of a truly patient-centered experience. The form funnels all requests — self-access and third-party — through the same generic authorization, the PDF is not fillable, and the fee disclosure is vague. The patient portal redirect is a genuine bright spot, but for patients who need the paper form, the experience is a standard paper-based workflow with no digital-first innovation. The organization earns credit for accessibility and active maintenance but loses ground on technical modernization and pathway differentiation.

# Riverwood Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Riverwood Healthcare Center is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Aitkin, MN. It maintains a Patient Forms page with multiple release-of-information documents and offers both printable PDF and online JotForm submission options. Three PDF forms were found (from 2015, 2018, and 2025), all general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms for releasing patient information. The organization also uses MyChart (OCHIN) for patient portal access, though this is not positioned as a records request channel on the Patient Forms page.

## Available Forms and Pathways

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3.pdf** (2025), the current "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" linked from the Patient Forms page as the "Printable Form." Two older versions (2018 and 2015) remain publicly accessible at their original WordPress upload URLs but are no longer linked from the main forms page. All three forms share essentially the same structure: patient demographics, release from/to fields, purpose checkboxes, record type selections, sensitive information opt-out, and standard HIPAA authorization language.

Critically, Riverwood also offers **HIPAA-compliant JotForm online submission** (https://hipaa.jotform.com/222405586410046) as an alternative to the printable PDF. This provides a fully digital workflow — no printing, handwriting, or faxing required. A second JotForm for "Consent for Release of Information" and a third for "Permission to Verbally Discuss PHI" are also available. These online options represent a meaningful accessibility advantage over the PDF-only approach.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Riverwood does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three PDF forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for releasing information from one entity to another. A patient requesting their own records must use the same from/to structure intended for third-party transfers — listing themselves in the "Release Information To" field. The "Personal Use" purpose checkbox is available, signaling that self-requests are anticipated, but there is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no statement of patient rights.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A simple web search for Riverwood's ROI form surfaced direct PDF links immediately. The Patient Forms page is accessible in one click from the main site navigation and provides organized links to both printable and online form options. The only concern is that outdated form versions (2015, 2018) remain publicly accessible, meaning a patient arriving via search engine could encounter a superseded form.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a **single-page, digitally composed PDF** with a clean layout, clear section headers, and notably helpful parenthetical plain-language guidance (e.g., "RELEASE INFORMATION FROM (WHO HAS THE INFORMATION YOU WANT RELEASED?)"). This design choice makes the form substantially more approachable than typical legal-style ROI forms.

However, the PDF has **zero fillable fields** — all checkboxes are Unicode characters (☐) rendered as text, not interactive elements. A patient must print and hand-fill the form. The JotForm alternative addresses this gap for patients who find it. The form does not collect Social Security Numbers (an improvement over the 2015 version, which did), and does not require a witness signature (also improved from the 2015 version).

Field count is reasonable at approximately 15–18 fields including demographics, from/to addresses, purpose, date range, record type selections, and signature. The authorization language is standard but dense, packed into two paragraphs with no visual breaks between concepts.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** on the current form — a positive.
- **Fax submission available** (218-927-5319), providing an electronic submission pathway beyond the JotForm.
- **No fees disclosed** on any form — appropriate for the authorization itself, though patients are not informed about potential costs.
- **Sensitive information defaults to release:** The form states "All information regarding chemical dependency will be released unless you restrict by initialing." This opt-out approach for 42 CFR Part 2–protected substance abuse records is the most significant compliance concern.
- **"Guardian" misspelled as "Gaurdian"** on the current form — a minor but unprofessional error.
- **Ambiguous revocation language:** The form requires patients to "present" written revocation to the Medical Records Department, which could be read as requiring in-person delivery.

## Overall Assessment

Riverwood Healthcare Center provides a **competent but undifferentiated** records request experience. The organization earns credit for easy findability, offering both printable and online submission options (via JotForm), and producing a clean single-page form with helpful plain-language guidance. The JotForm option is a genuine bright spot that elevates the digital experience. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the generic authorization form design, the non-fillable PDF, and the concerning opt-out model for sensitive information prevent a higher rating. This is a typical small critical access hospital approach — functional but not patient-centered.

# Massachusetts General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), part of the Mass General Brigham system (formerly Partners HealthCare), provides a single general-purpose authorization form for all records release requests. Three versions of this form were found at different URLs, representing the form's evolution from 2016 through 2024. The current version (form-1.pdf, MGB00087 06/24) is the clear best-available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Forms and Pathways

All three downloaded documents are versions of the same form — "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information." The current version is hosted on the parent system domain (massgeneralbrigham.org), while two older versions persist at legacy URLs on massgeneral.org. There is no dedicated patient access request form, online portal, or web-based request wizard. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it, and submitting via mail or fax.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MGH does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The same authorization form serves patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient selects "Personal" from the purpose checkboxes and checks a box to have records mailed to their own address. The form references HIPAA authorization requirements (§ 164.508) but never mentions the patient's Right of Access under § 164.524. This means a patient requesting their own records navigates a process designed primarily for third-party disclosure — workable, but not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, CAPTCHAs, or login requirements. The main concern is that two superseded versions remain publicly accessible at legacy URLs, creating a risk that patients could download an outdated, non-fillable version. The current form lives on the parent system domain rather than massgeneral.org, which could confuse patients who start at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a 2-page digitally native PDF with **78 fillable interactive fields** — a significant upgrade from the older versions, which had zero fillable fields. The form follows a clear A–E section structure: patient information, permission to share, information to be released, sensitive information consent, and terms/signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and logical flow.

Language is moderately plain — straightforward instructions at the top, clear section labels, and accessible phrasing in most areas. The required regulatory language in Section D (42 CFR Part 2 for substance use records) is necessarily dense but presented legibly. Section E's terms are written in clear, formal prose with important patient protections stated explicitly ("This authorization is voluntary"; treatment will not be conditioned on signing).

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: Patient Gateway (patient portal), secure email, fax, and paper mail — giving patients genuine electronic options for record receipt. However, submission of the form itself is limited to mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No electronic form submission**: Despite 78 fillable fields enabling digital completion, the form must be printed and mailed or faxed. Fax is an adequate electronic pathway per study criteria, so this is not a major penalty, but the gap between fillable fields and fax-only submission is a missed opportunity.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form notes "Copying fees may apply" for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes. Personal and Medical Care are not asterisked, implying no fees — but this is never stated affirmatively. HIPAA limits fees for patient access, and this distinction deserves explicit clarification.
- **Mandatory date specification**: Patients "MUST specify dates" for every record type requested, with no "all records" option. This could burden patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Stale versions at legacy URLs**: Two outdated, non-fillable versions remain publicly accessible, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Fillable PDF with comprehensive field coverage** (78 fields) — active investment in digital accessibility
- **Four electronic delivery options** including patient portal and secure email
- **Granular sensitive-information consent** with seven separate opt-in categories (HIV, genetics, substance use, mental health, social work, domestic violence, sexual assault)
- **Clear non-coercion statement** and voluntary authorization language
- **No notarization or witness required**
- **Version-controlled form** with clear identifiers (MGB00087 06/24)

## Overall Assessment

MGH provides a competent, well-structured authorization form with strong technical execution (fillable fields, electronic delivery options) but falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form. The form is easy to find, clearly organized, and free of major barriers. The primary gaps are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, ambiguous fee language, and the persistence of outdated form versions online. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process was designed for institutional release workflows rather than individual access rights.

# Southeast Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Southeast Medical Group (SEMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Alpharetta, Georgia. SEMG does not publish its own standalone Release of Information form. Instead, it outsources the entire records-request process to **MediCopy**, a third-party health information management vendor. Four documents were retrieved during the evaluation: two versions of MediCopy's generic ROI authorization form (2023 and 2020), an SEMG patient portal proxy authorization form, and SEMG's multi-page patient registration packet. Only the MediCopy authorization forms are relevant to a patient requesting their own records.

## Pathways Available

The patient journey for requesting records begins at SEMG's website. The Resources section includes a "Medical Records" area with a "Request Records" link, which redirects through `semg.link/med-records` to **medicopy.net/patients** — a third-party site with no SEMG branding. From there, patients can either download a PDF authorization form or use MediCopy's HelloSign-based online authorization wizard. SEMG's FAQ also provides an email address (medicalrecords@southeastmedicalgroup.com) as a contact point for records requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SEMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The MediCopy authorization form is a generic instrument that treats every request identically — whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney is requesting them. "Personal Use" is listed among five purpose-of-disclosure options, but there is no separate pathway, form, or instructions for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The form asks patients to fill in both a source facility and a recipient, requiring a self-requesting patient to effectively provide their own contact information twice. No mention is made of patient-specific rights, fee limits, or the distinct legal framework that applies to individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. Direct searches for SEMG-specific ROI forms on the SEMG website and via Google yielded nothing — the forms page lists 10 patient forms but no ROI authorization. The FAQ answer for "How can I get a copy of my medical record?" is helpful, providing a direct link to MediCopy and an email address. However, a patient who bypasses the FAQ and navigates to the forms page would find no relevant document. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during retrieval. The redirect chain to a third-party site introduces an element of confusion — a patient clicking "Request Records" lands on a MediCopy page with no mention of SEMG.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (MediCopy 2023 authorization, form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. Despite being digitally authored, it has **zero fillable form fields** — patients must print and handwrite all information. The layout is well-organized, following a logical top-down flow: source facility → patient demographics → recipient → record types → purpose → delivery method → signature. Section headers use plain, conversational language ("Tell us about the patient," "How would you like the records sent?"), which is notably more approachable than typical ROI forms. The authorization paragraph is a single block of standard legal text covering validity, revocation, re-disclosure, and no-conditioning — dense but not unreasonably so.

The form offers good granularity for record-type selection (11 options including date ranges and "Other") and an opt-out exclusion model for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/STDs, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postal mail.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and creates unnecessary identity theft risk. **No submission instructions**: The form itself contains no address, fax number, email, or portal link for returning the completed authorization — a patient who downloads the PDF in isolation has no way to know where to send it. **Fee opacity**: The form notes "additional fee applies" for postal delivery but provides no dollar amounts for any delivery method. More concerning, SEMG's registration packet (form-4) discloses an Administrative Service Fee structure of $10–$150 per form, with "immunization records" listed as an example — this broad language could encompass patient access requests and would likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based fee limits.

## Notable Strengths

The plain-language section headers and sensitive-record exclusion options are genuine bright spots in form design. MediCopy's availability of an online HelloSign authorization provides a fully digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF. The FAQ's direct answer about records requests, including both a link and an email address, is more helpful than many practices' web presences. SEMG's registration form also includes modern patient-centered fields for preferred language and pronouns.

## Overall Assessment

SEMG provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records requests. The outsourcing to MediCopy means patients interact with a generic vendor form that was not designed around patient self-access. The form's content design is above average thanks to plain language and logical organization, but technical limitations (non-fillable PDF, missing submission instructions) and compliance gaps (SSN collection, fee ambiguity) weigh it down. The organization earns a middling assessment: records are obtainable, but the process was clearly not designed with the individual patient in mind.

# UPMC Presbyterian — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

UPMC Presbyterian uses the system-wide UPMC "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (form-1.pdf), a two-page PDF hosted on UPMC's Digital Asset Management CDN. Two additional documents were found: an In-Home Urgent Care variant (form-2.pdf) for home-based care services, and an informational guide (form-3.pdf) that walks patients through completing the main form. The primary form relevant to a patient at UPMC Presbyterian requesting their own hospital records is form-1.pdf.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UPMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to physicians, insurers, attorneys, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form used for third-party release, selecting "Personal Use" as the purpose and listing themselves as the recipient. However, UPMC does include a notable inline annotation: **"Purpose is not required for patient access,"** a clear acknowledgment of HIPAA individual access rights that most organizations omit. This partially bridges the gap, but the form's structure — "I authorize UPMC to release information to: [Facility/Person to Receive Records]" — remains fundamentally oriented toward release to third parties. There is no separate patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a MyChart-based records request workflow in the materials reviewed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links on UPMC's CDN. The form is prominently linked from both the system-wide medical records page and the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page. No bot blocking, broken links, or login requirements were encountered. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a **born-digital but print-first PDF**. Despite being created digitally (22 embedded fonts, not a scan), it has essentially no fillable fields — only 1 unnamed interactive field was detected across the entire document. All data entry points use underscore-style blank lines and checkbox squares intended for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit it via mail or fax.

The form is **extremely dense**. Page 1 packs facility selection (14+ UPMC hospitals), patient demographics, recipient information, purpose, disclosure format, delivery method, record type selection (20+ specific document types), sensitive-information opt-outs, expiration terms, and signature blocks onto a single page. While the logical flow is sound (sections labeled A through C), the tight spacing and small text create a visually overwhelming experience. Page 2 contains patient rights and responsibilities disclosures.

The language mixes plain English with legal terminology. Instructions like "Parts 1 and 2 below must be completed" are clear, but fee language and re-disclosure warnings are dense. The 20+ record-type checkboxes offer impressive granularity but may overwhelm patients who simply want "all my records."

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Fee language is ambiguous for patient access.** The form states "charges may be associated with this request" citing Pennsylvania state law, without distinguishing patient access (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) from third-party requests. The phrase "records will be sent upon receipt of payment" could be read as conditioning access on pre-payment.
- **90-day default authorization expiration** is unusually short and may force resubmission if processing is slow, though patients can specify up to one year.
- **No fillable fields** despite born-digital creation is a missed opportunity that forces a paper workflow.
- **Fax delivery restricted to "Providers Only"** — patients cannot receive records by fax, though email and Direct Address are available as electronic delivery alternatives.

## Notable Strengths

- **Companion instruction guide** (form-3.pdf) is a rare patient-friendly resource that explains each section with plain-language examples (e.g., "Inpatient: Admitted for treatment or surgery with overnight stay in hospital").
- **"Purpose is not required for patient access"** — an unusually clear inline acknowledgment of HIPAA rights.
- **Email and Direct Address delivery options** demonstrate awareness of digital access preferences.
- **Anti-conditioning statement** explicitly states UPMC will not condition treatment on signing.
- **Oral authorization provision** for patients physically unable to sign, with two-witness requirements.

## Overall Assessment

UPMC Presbyterian provides an accessible, findable ROI form with some genuinely patient-friendly features — particularly the companion guide and the "purpose not required" note. However, the organization funnels all record requests through a single generic authorization form that was designed for third-party release, lacks interactive form fields despite being born-digital, and uses ambiguous fee language that doesn't clearly distinguish patient access rights. The result is a process that a motivated patient can navigate but that was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. For a major academic health system, the lack of any digital-first submission pathway (online portal, fillable PDF, or web form) is a notable gap.

# Cherokee Health Systems (River Valley Health) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cherokee Health Systems, now rebranded as **River Valley Health**, is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The organization provides a well-organized suite of four PDF documents for medical records requests, available on a dedicated Medical Records page at rvh.org. The suite consists of the primary English ROI authorization form, a Spanish translation, and color-coded instructional guides in both languages — a standout accessibility feature that few organizations match.

## Forms and Pathways

All four documents are variants of a single general-purpose **"Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Health Records"** form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form distinct from the third-party release authorization. The form is bidirectional — it can be used to request records from an external provider or to authorize River Valley Health to send records elsewhere. A "Personal Use" checkbox is included among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Record Requested to be Sent From" and "Record to be Sent To" facility sections) assumes an inter-facility transfer model. A patient wanting a copy of their own records must awkwardly fit themselves into the "Record to be Sent To" facility section.

Submission is available via **email** (registration@rvh.org) or **in person**. No fax number for submission is listed on the forms or in the notes, though the form collects fax numbers for the sending/receiving facilities. The email pathway means patients can submit without a physical visit, which is a meaningful accessibility advantage.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which is also accessible via the main website navigation (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records). All four PDFs are prominently linked with clear labels and descriptive filenames. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot protection blocking direct programmatic downloads — a hosting infrastructure issue, not an intentional barrier. The page includes contextual submission instructions alongside the download links.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — despite being born-digital and recently updated (December 2025), the form was designed for print-and-handwrite completion. A patient must print, fill by hand, scan or photograph, and email the result. This is a meaningful accessibility gap for a 2025-era document.

The layout is logically organized with clear section headers: patient information, sending facility, receiving facility, record type checkboxes, purpose checkboxes, and a signature block. The upper portion is clean and self-explanatory. The lower portion contains two dense legal paragraphs — a sensitive information disclosure notice (appropriately citing 42 C.F.R. Part 2 and HIPAA) and a certification block that packs six signer categories into a single run-on sentence. The certification text is challenging for a typical patient to parse.

The **color-coded instructional guides** (forms 3 and 4) are a genuine bright spot. They overlay plain-language annotations explaining each section ("Enter your personal information in this section," "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider"), effectively translating bureaucratic form headers into understandable instructions. This paired approach — plain form plus annotated guide — is uncommon and genuinely helpful.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no fee disclosure (meaning no upfront fee barrier, though patients are also not informed of costs). The authorization expires after 12 months, and revocation rights are clearly stated.

The form does **not** reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), does not include a patient rights statement, and does not state a response timeframe. These are missed opportunities but not violations.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: The bilingual form suite with instructional companions is exceptional. Providing annotated guides in both English and Spanish demonstrates genuine commitment to patient comprehension and language accessibility — this goes well beyond the typical approach of offering a bare authorization form. The forms are recently updated (December 2025), indicating active maintenance. Email submission availability removes the in-person barrier.

**Weaknesses**: The absence of fillable fields in a born-digital 2025 PDF is a notable gap. The form's generic ROI authorization design does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a bidirectional facility-routing model when they simply want their own records. The Spanish version contains minor translation errors (CRF vs. CFR, missing closing parenthesis).

## Overall Assessment

Cherokee Health Systems earns a **B grade** overall. The organization clearly invested in patient communication — the bilingual instructional guides are a model other organizations should emulate. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the form wasn't designed with that use case front-of-mind.

# Decatur County Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Decatur County Hospital (Leon, IA) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in rural Iowa. The facility offers a single authorization form — "Authorization for Access, Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (DCH-#0001) — for all medical records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway; the same generic HIPAA authorization form serves both patients requesting their own records and third-party release scenarios.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form's opening language reads: "I, the undersigned authorize and request Decatur County Hospital to: Allow access, use or disclosure of my protected health information to: OR obtain from:" — presenting patient access and third-party release as two branches of the same document. A patient simply wanting to view or obtain copies of their own records must navigate fields designed for third-party recipients (recipient organization, address, fax number) that are irrelevant to their situation. The form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox, which is the closest it comes to acknowledging individual access rights, but there is no explicit reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524. No patient portal-based records request workflow or online submission mechanism was identified.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. While initial broad web searches failed, a site-scoped search quickly located the PDF linked from the hospital's Patient Portal page. The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0001-Auth-for-Access-Use-or-Disclosure-of-PHI.pdf`) is descriptive, and no bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. For a small rural hospital, the form's online availability is commendable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a genuine bright spot in terms of technical design. Created with Acrobat PDFMaker for Word, it is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 61 AcroForm interactive fields — covering patient demographics, record type checkboxes, purpose options, sensitive-records initials, fee agreement, and signatures. Nearly every blank on the form can be completed electronically without printing. However, AcroForm field names are empty, which would hinder screen reader accessibility.

The form fits everything onto a single page — admirably compact but visually dense. The logical flow is sound (patient identity → recipient → dates → record types → purpose → sensitive records → fees → legal text → signature), but cramming 61 fields, 13 record-type checkboxes, and multiple legal paragraphs onto one page likely challenges readability. The first half uses straightforward language, while the second half descends into dense regulatory prose, particularly the re-disclosure paragraph citing 42 CFR Part 2 and Iowa Code chapters 228 and 141.

Record-type granularity is a strength: patients can select from 13 specific categories (Discharge Summary, H&P, Consultation, Radiology, Progress Notes, OR Report, Pathology, Labs, ER Notes, EKG, PT/OT/ST, Photographs) plus "Other" and a "Review only" option. This gives patients meaningful control over scope.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Social Security Number**: The form requests SSN — unnecessary for patient identification under HIPAA and a significant identity-theft risk on a form that may be faxed or mailed. A medical record number (included as "for office use only") is sufficient.

**Blank fee amount**: The fee disclosure states the hospital "may impose a fee of [blank]" and asks patients to agree to unspecified costs. This prevents patients from making informed decisions about fees before submitting their request.

**No delivery format options**: The form lacks any field for patients to specify how they want to receive records (mail, electronic, in-person). HIPAA § 164.524(c)(2)(i) requires entities to provide records in the form and format requested if readily producible.

**Outdated**: Last reviewed March 2018 — nearly eight years old, predating the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective 2021).

**Binding language**: The statement that authorization provisions "take precedence over statements made in the Decatur County Hospital's Notice of Privacy Practices" is potentially misleading, suggesting patients might be waiving protections.

## Strengths

The form includes an explicit conditioning prohibition (treatment will not be conditioned on signing), clear revocation instructions with a mailing address, and appropriate separate-initials requirements for sensitive records (substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS) under applicable federal and state law. The comprehensive record-type granularity and digital-first fillable design are notable positives.

## Overall Assessment

Decatur County Hospital provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records access. The fillable PDF is technically sound, but the generic authorization approach, SSN collection, blank fee amount, outdated review date, and absence of delivery format options collectively place this facility below the standard patients should expect for exercising their individual access rights.

# NorthLakes Community Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NorthLakes Community Clinic is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Ashland, Wisconsin. The organization publishes two Release of Information forms on its website, both generic HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 authorization forms that serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party transfers, legal, disability, and more. There is no dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization.

## Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms are publicly available from the medical records page (https://nlccwi.org/for-our-patients/medical-records/):

- **form-1.pdf** ("Release of Information," 12/2023): The newer, current form. One page, numbered sections (1–6), with clear "Release FROM" / "Release TO" fields, granular record-type checkboxes, and explicit fax submission instructions (715-318-5644). However, it has **zero fillable fields** — a patient must print and hand-fill it. It does offer an encrypted email delivery option for receiving records.

- **form-2.pdf** ("Health Information Release," 4/2022): The older form with **54 fillable PDF fields**, intentionally designed for digital completion (the filename includes "Fillable"). But it lacks any submission instructions — no fax number, no mailing address, no email. A patient who fills it out digitally has no idea where to send it.

Both share the same internal registration number (REG-002), suggesting form-1 was meant to supersede form-2, yet both remain available with no guidance on which to use. The organization appears to have regressed in digital accessibility: the newer form removed fillable fields while adding better submission instructions and an encrypted email delivery option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NorthLakes does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Release FROM" / "Release TO" structure designed for inter-organizational transfers. A patient requesting their own records must place NorthLakes in the "FROM" field and themselves in the "TO" field — workable but not intuitive. Positively, both forms include a "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox, explicitly acknowledging patient-directed requests as a valid use case. Neither form references HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) by name.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A simple web search immediately returned both PDF URLs. The organization's website hosts them as direct links under a clearly labeled medical records section. No bot blocking, login, or JavaScript rendering was required. Retrieval difficulty: **Easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Assessed using the high-watermark principle across both forms:

- **Fillability**: The older form-2 is genuinely fillable with 54 interactive fields. The current form-1 is not. A patient aware of both could use form-2 for digital completion, but the org steers toward form-1.
- **Layout**: Both forms use numbered sections with reasonable logical flow (patient info → directionality → purpose → record types → consent/signature). However, both cram everything onto a single dense page. Form-2's purpose and record-type sections are visually interleaved in a confusing two-column layout.
- **Language**: Consent paragraphs lean toward dense legalese, particularly on form-2 where a long unbroken paragraph covers treatment conditioning, re-disclosure, 42 CFR Part 2, Wisconsin DHS regulations, and revocation rights with no visual breaks. Form-1 improves on this with bulleted "I understand that..." statements.
- **Record selection**: Unusually granular. Both forms separate Mental Health, Substance Use Treatment, and Psychiatry records into distinct categories with individual checkboxes — giving patients fine-grained control over sensitive disclosures.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness required. No in-person submission requirement. Fax submission is explicitly available (form-1). No fees are mentioned — neither disclosed as free nor quantified. No response time is stated, though form-1 provides an urgent fax line for requests "requiring a response within a week." The confusing citation of "Federal Privacy Law (42 CFR Part 2) (HIPAA)" incorrectly implies 42 CFR Part 2 is part of HIPAA, which could mislead patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Encrypted email delivery option for records (form-1)
- "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox on both forms
- Granular behavioral health record type selection
- Verbal revocation explicitly acknowledged (form-2)
- Clear treatment non-conditioning language
- Fillable PDF exists (form-2), showing digital investment capability

## Overall Assessment

NorthLakes Community Clinic provides a functional but unrefined patient access experience. The forms are easy to find, free of major barriers, and offer good record-type granularity. However, the organization funnels all patients through a generic ROI authorization designed for third-party transfers, with no dedicated patient access pathway. The regression from a fillable to a non-fillable primary form is a notable step backward. A patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience. **Grade: C (3.35/5.0).**

# Memorial Healthcare System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Memorial Healthcare System (Hollywood, FL) is a government-owned regional hospital system serving South Florida. The system's medical records page provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" form available in three languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole), plus a separate Request for Amendment form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form; all record requests flow through the same HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release.

## Pathways and Primary Form

The primary pathway is a downloadable PDF form (form-1.pdf in English) linked from the main website at Patients & Visitors > Medical Records. The form lists five delivery methods — Pick-up, Mail Out, e-Delivery, CD, and MyChart — prominently at the top, showing the org supports both traditional and electronic record delivery. MyChart is referenced as a delivery option, suggesting patients may also be able to request records through their patient portal. The medical records page states a two-business-day processing commitment, far faster than the HIPAA-allowed 30-day window.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is titled "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" and is structured around disclosing records to a named recipient (Section 4: "This information is to be released to: Name / Address"). While an email field explicitly reads "I request my records be sent to me at this e-mail address" — clear patient-access language — the overall form design is a generic authorization. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and Section 5h requires patients to state a purpose for the disclosure, which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form and process as an attorney or insurer, figuring out which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The medical records page is linked from the main navigation, the PDF is directly downloadable without login or CAPTCHA, and all language versions are grouped on the same page. No bot blocking was encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — every checkbox, text field, and signature line must be completed by hand after printing. This is consistent across all three language versions. The file is bloated at 2.45 MB (vs. ~700 KB for the identically structured Spanish and Creole versions), with 23 embedded fonts and garbled hidden content from overlapping template layers — including staff business cards, physician rosters, and internal template labels like "JDCH Oncology BC (Multiple Doctors & Locations) FRONT." This hidden content inflates file size and produces garbled output for assistive technologies.

The form's content is organized in five numbered sections with logical flow: facility selection, patient identification, record type selection (~15 granular options), recipient information, and acknowledgment statements. The acknowledgments (Sections 5a–5h) are dense legal text — particularly the electronic delivery risk-shifting language in 5e, which requires patients to "knowingly and voluntarily assume this risk and all consequences, losses and damages" for electronic records. This language could discourage patients from exercising their right to receive records electronically.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No notarization or witness is required.** Fees are not disclosed on the form itself; the website mentions "copy charges as authorized by Florida law" with an exception for records sent to treating physicians. The six-month authorization expiration is standard. No in-person-only submission restriction exists — forms can be mailed. However, there is no explicit electronic submission pathway for the form itself (no fax, no email-based submission explicitly stated, though MyChart may serve this role).

**Bright spots** are notable. The trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is exemplary and uncommon — most organizations offer at most English and Spanish. The five delivery methods, including e-Delivery and MyChart, are forward-thinking. The two-business-day processing commitment is remarkably fast. Granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control.

**Red flags** include the electronic delivery risk-shifting language (Section 5e), the purpose field that may create an impression that patients need to justify their access, and the bloated English PDF with garbled hidden content that affects accessibility tools.

## Overall Assessment

Memorial Healthcare System demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness in several areas — multilingual access, fast processing, and electronic delivery options — but is held back by a non-fillable, generic authorization form that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The form's paper-based workflow and dense legal language create unnecessary friction. The org earns a solid **B** grade overall: excellent findability and some compliance strengths offset by a fundamentally paper-based process and a form that wasn't designed with patients as the primary audience.

# Garfield Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Garfield Medical Center (GMC), a for-profit community hospital in Monterey Park, CA, operated by AHMC Healthcare Inc., provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URL paths on the AHMC website. Neither form is specifically designed for patient self-access; both are general-purpose "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" documents that serve third-party release and personal use alike.

## Access Pathway

GMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient requesting their own records must use the same authorization form designed for release to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. The form includes "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox, and a patient could fill in their own name in the "Release To" field, but the framing is clearly oriented toward third-party disclosure ("I authorize Garfield Medical Center to Release Medical records to: Person/Organization"). There is no online portal, no digital request wizard, and no separate patient access request form.

That said, the form does include an "Inspect or Review Medical Record" option alongside copies, acknowledging the patient's right to review records in person — a positive touch that many facilities omit.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, login requirements, or browser workarounds needed. Both form versions were indexed and accessible via descriptive URLs. The only minor confusion is that two near-identical forms exist at different paths (`/gmc/documents/` and `/gmc/docs/`), both marked "Revised 9/21." A patient discovering both would have no clear way to determine which is authoritative.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — **not** a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand despite its digital origin. This is a significant missed opportunity: the form was clearly authored in a word processor but exported without interactive fields.

The layout is well-organized, following a logical flow: Patient Information → Release To → Purpose → Information to Be Released → Delivery Instructions → Notice of Rights → Term → Signature. Section headers are clear and distinct. The form offers impressive granularity in record type selection (12+ specific categories plus "ALL RECORDS") and provides multiple delivery options including email with a dedicated address field.

Language is generally accessible, using an "I understand that..." format for patient rights. However, legal references to California Health and Safety Code sections are included without plain-language explanation. The opening line — "Failure to provide all information may invalidate this authorization" — sets an intimidating tone, and it is unclear which fields are truly mandatory.

## Barriers & Concerns

- **CD liability waiver bundled into authorization:** All patients must waive liability for CD release as part of signing the form, even when not requesting imaging on CD. This is consent bundling.
- **Fees disclosed without amounts:** The form references California fee statutes but provides no specific costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate expenses.
- **Revocation limited to postal mail:** Revoking authorization requires a signed letter mailed to the Privacy Officer — no fax, email, or in-person option.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive absence.
- **Submission methods:** The form lists fax (626-307-2186), mail, email, pick-up, and hand delivery. Fax and email availability mean a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery option** with a dedicated field — uncommon among ROI forms.
- **"Inspect or Review" checkbox** alongside copies — acknowledges the HIPAA right to review.
- **Granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control.
- **Clear treatment non-conditionality statement** and 180-day expiration with patient override.

## Overall Assessment

Garfield Medical Center provides a reasonably well-structured authorization form that is easy to find and offers useful features like email delivery and record type granularity. However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form, lacking fillable fields, and bundling a CD liability waiver. The absence of a dedicated patient access pathway and the non-fillable PDF format are the most significant gaps. The facility meets the baseline for electronic submission (fax and email are available) but offers no modern digital workflow.

# UW Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UW Medical Center, part of the UW Medicine system (University of Washington), provides a single ROI form for all of its facilities: "Patient Authorization to Disclose, Release, and/or Obtain Protected Health Information" (form U0626, version V.2512, last approved December 2025). This 3-page fillable PDF covers Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center (Montlake and Northwest campuses), UW Medicine Primary Care, and UW Physicians. No separate patient-access-specific form exists — this is a generic HIPAA authorization serving both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UW Medicine does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from third-party authorization. The single form handles all release scenarios — attorneys, providers, insurers, and patients alike. The "Purpose of Request" section includes a "Personal" checkbox, and the "Recipient of Records" field lists "Patient" as one example alongside "Insurance Company, Attorney, Physician." A patient can certainly use this form, but the framing treats self-access as one option among many rather than a first-class use case.

However, UW Medicine partially compensates with an outstanding **MyChart fast-track**: the form opens with a prominent callout — *"Recent medical records are available via MyChart for immediate download without filling out this form"* — and page 3 elaborates with instructions and a URL. The form also notes that an electronic request form is available within MyChart as an alternative. This effectively creates a two-tier system: MyChart for recent records (instant, self-service), and the paper authorization for everything else.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. Web searches for UW Medical Center ROI terms immediately surfaced it, and the UW Medicine website's Patient Forms page links directly to the canonical URL on the UW compliance site (`depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf`). One complication: the uwmedicine.org CDN blocks programmatic downloads (403 errors), but since the official patient forms page links to the compliance-hosted version, patients following the normal path encounter no issues. No browser fallback was needed for the working URL.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-designed interactive PDF with **61 fillable fields**, a full text layer, and 10 embedded fonts — clearly a digital-first document, not a scan. The layout follows a logical **numbered structure** (Items #1–7): patient information, purpose, facility selection, recipient, record types, format preferences, and expiration. This is easy to follow and a patient could complete it without assistance.

**Language** is mostly plain and accessible, though the patient rights section on page 2 includes a dense legal paragraph about conditioning treatment on authorization that would challenge many readers. Page 3 provides item-by-item **completion instructions** — an unusual and genuinely helpful addition that sets this form apart.

**Delivery format options** are exceptional: CD/DVD, Paper, MyChart, USB/Thumb Drive, and Email — five choices, more than nearly any other provider form. **Submission channels** are equally strong: postal mail, fax ((206) 744-9997), and email (uwmedroi@uw.edu), with separate contacts for billing records.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. There is **no notarization or witness requirement**, no in-person submission mandate, and no fee disclosure on the form (neither a stated fee nor a stated exemption). The 3-year default authorization expiration is generous. Revocation requires a written request to the Compliance Office — standard but could be more accessible.

One ambiguity: the form includes a blanket statement that the authorization "permits UW Medicine to release information related to sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, behavioral or mental health services, and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse," which could confuse patients about whether signing automatically releases all sensitive categories.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart fast-track** at the top of the form actively diverts patients to faster self-service
- **Five delivery formats** give patients genuine choice
- **Three submission channels** (mail, fax, email) with complete contact information
- **Instruction page** with item-by-item guidance and honest expectations about record completeness
- **Multi-facility coverage** via a single form with clear facility checkboxes
- **Sensitive information opt-in model** for specific unit records (sexual assault, mental health, living donor)

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access form — generic authorization serves all purposes
- No mention of HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or fee limits for patient access
- "PLACE PATIENT LABEL HERE" hospital artifact may confuse patients filling out at home
- Fillable field names are empty in metadata, potentially indicating accessibility deficiencies for screen readers

## Overall Assessment

UW Medical Center provides a **competent, well-designed generic authorization form** with strong digital capabilities and multiple submission options. The MyChart promotion is a standout patient-centering feature that partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway. The form's thorough instruction page, granular record selection, and five delivery formats demonstrate genuine care for usability. The main gap is structural: patients requesting their own records navigate the same form designed for attorneys and insurers, with no acknowledgment that their rights and fee protections differ. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and mostly patient-friendly, but not designed around patient self-access as a primary use case.

# Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital is part of **Cottage Health**, a regional nonprofit system serving the Santa Barbara/Goleta area of California. The hospital does not maintain its own ROI forms; instead, it uses Cottage Health's system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (Form NS1405). Three documents were retrieved: the current English form (Aug 2025), a complete Spanish translation (Form NS1406, Aug 2025), and a superseded English version (Jun 2025). Cottage Health also offers an online electronic request pathway via Swellbox, linked from the same medical records page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

The primary form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of health information disclosure — to providers, insurers, attorneys, and the patient themselves. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. However, Section C includes a clear **"Patient (self)" checkbox**, so a patient requesting their own records can use the form without pretending to be a third party. The form's title ("Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information"), structure (redisclosure restrictions, recipient relationship fields), and framing are clearly built around the third-party release paradigm. A self-requesting patient must navigate sections that don't apply to them — recipient relationship, redisclosure restrictions — and there is no streamlined "I just want my own records" pathway on the PDF itself.

The **Swellbox online wizard** (linked from the medical records page) provides an alternative digital pathway that may be more patient-centric, though it was not evaluated in detail.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The medical records page sits at a clear navigation path (Home > Patients & Visitors > Accessing Your Medical Records) and is well-organized. The main friction was technical: the primary website URLs are protected by Akamai CDN, which blocks programmatic downloads. Azure Blob Storage mirror URLs worked without issue. The website also hosted both June and August 2025 versions simultaneously, creating minor version-confusion risk. The older version remains live at its original URL with no "outdated" notice.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a **2-page, digitally-authored PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. Despite this, it has **zero fillable/interactive form fields**. All checkboxes and text blanks are static visual elements. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and then scan or photograph it for electronic submission. This contradicts the form's own statement that "VALID ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES WILL BE ACCEPTED" — the form signals digital readiness but doesn't deliver it.

The layout is well-organized with **nine lettered sections (A–I)**, each with clear headings, following a logical flow: patient info → record scope → recipient → delivery method → expiration → rights → restrictions → cost → signature. The language is **mostly plain**, with an accessible opening statement about the right to refuse. Some passages lean toward legalese (redisclosure restrictions in Section G). At approximately 15–18 fields, the scope is reasonable for the content covered.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Submission methods** are genuinely flexible: email (medicalrecords@sbch.org), fax, and mail are all accepted. No in-person requirement exists. Electronic signatures are explicitly accepted. **No notarization** is required.

**Fees** are vaguely disclosed: "There may be a fee for copies of medical records. You will be notified in advance." No fee schedule or amount is provided, and the waiver for provider-to-provider transfers could imply that patient self-requests do incur fees. The form commits to a **15-day turnaround**, faster than HIPAA's 30-day requirement.

One **red flag**: the opening warning that "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" could function as a barrier, potentially giving the organization grounds to reject incomplete but actionable requests. HIPAA does not permit denying access based on incomplete non-essential fields.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version**: A complete, professionally translated form (NS1406) — not a summary — demonstrating genuine linguistic accessibility for the Goleta/Santa Barbara community.
- **MyChart delivery option**: Patients can receive records directly through the patient portal, a modern approach many organizations lack.
- **Swellbox online alternative**: A fully digital request pathway exists alongside the PDF, giving patients a choice.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Email, fax, and mail all accepted — no physical visit required.
- **California sensitive-category handling**: Appropriate opt-in checkboxes for Mental Health, Chemical Dependency, HIV, and Reproductive Healthcare with state law citations.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Health provides a **competent but not exemplary** patient access experience. The system earns credit for offering multiple pathways (PDF, Swellbox portal, email/fax submission), a Spanish translation, and MyChart delivery. However, the core form is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF undermines the digital workflow the system otherwise supports. The vague fee language and "invalidation" warning are minor compliance concerns. A patient can successfully request their own records through this system without undue hardship, but the process could be meaningfully improved with a patient-specific form and interactive PDF fields.

**Grade: B** — Good overall with room for improvement in patient-centeredness and technical accessibility of the PDF form.

# Phelps Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, NY is a community hospital within the Northwell Health system. It uses Northwell's system-wide forms for medical records requests, hosted at the parent system's medical records page (northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records). Six documents were retrieved in total: two core forms (patient access and third-party authorization), a Spanish bilingual authorization form, two companion instruction guides, and a duplicate non-fillable version of the authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

Northwell Health stands out by clearly differentiating patient self-access from third-party release. The medical records page has two distinct sections: "Request for Access to Health Information" (for patients requesting their own records) and "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (for directing records to third parties). The patient access form (form-2) is explicitly titled "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative" and opens by citing HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524) — framing the request as an exercise of patient rights rather than a permission grant. A "To me" checkbox in Section 2 makes the self-access pathway concrete. This separation is a genuine best practice that many health systems fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches for "Phelps Hospital" combined with medical records terms immediately surfaced the Northwell Health medical records page. The page is well-organized with descriptive URLs and clear section headings. The main friction is that Phelps Hospital's own sub-site (phelps.northwell.edu) does not host forms directly — patients must navigate to the parent system's website, which is a minor extra step but the connection is clear from the Northwell branding.

## Form Document Quality

The primary patient access form (form-2) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with 28 fillable interactive fields. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence: patient demographics, facility releasing records, recipient (with "To me" option), delivery manner and format, requested health information scope, substance use/HIV section, and signature. The delivery options grid is particularly well-designed, pairing delivery manner (mail, pickup, email, fax) with format (paper, USB, CD, secure/unsecure email) in a structured table. Scope options include medical record abstract, date-range records, entire record, lab results, radiology, itemized bills, and a free-text "Other" field — giving patients granular control.

The language is reasonably plain, with parenthetical glosses like "(From Who)" and "(To Who)" alongside formal labels. The substance use disorder section (Section 5) is denser legal text, but it's conditionally required — only for patients requesting those specific record types. A companion instruction document (form-6) provides step-by-step annotated examples with sample data, significantly lowering the completion barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization is required. The witness signature line is present but not explicitly mandatory. No fees are mentioned. No in-person submission is required. These are all positives.

The most significant gap is the absence of submission instructions on the form itself — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link. A patient who fills out the form has no guidance on where to send it. Fax submission is presumably available as an industry standard for Northwell facilities, but the patient must find this information independently.

A notable equity concern: the website has a bug where both the "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)" links point to the same URL, which contains only the Spanish authorization (third-party) form. There is no Spanish-language version of the patient access form despite the website appearing to offer one. This effectively denies Spanish-speaking patients access to the correct form for exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

## Notable Strengths

The strongest features of Northwell's approach for Phelps Hospital patients are: (1) the dedicated patient access form with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation, (2) companion instruction documents for both forms with annotated visual examples, (3) rich delivery format options including secure email, USB, CD, and fax, (4) fully fillable interactive PDFs for digital completion, and (5) plain-language accessibility touches throughout. The dual-form architecture — with separate patient access and third-party release pathways — represents a structural investment in patient-centered design.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Hospital, through its parent Northwell Health system, provides an above-average patient records request experience. The dedicated patient access pathway — with its explicit HIPAA § 164.524 framing, separate form architecture, and companion instruction materials — represents a genuinely patient-centered design that earns top marks for patient-centeredness. The fillable digital forms and comprehensive delivery options round out a strong offering. The main weaknesses — missing submission instructions on the form and the broken Spanish form links — are addressable defects rather than structural problems. This is a solid B-grade experience overall (4.25/5.0): clearly competent and patient-aware, with room for improvement in closing operational gaps.

# JPS Health Network — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

JPS Health Network (John Peter Smith Hospital) is a government-owned community hospital in Fort Worth, TX. The organization's Patient Records page offers three downloadable forms: a primary ROI authorization form (English, with a Spanish version also available), an HIE opt-in authorization, and an HIE revocation form. Only the ROI form (form-1) is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records.

## Forms & Pathways

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is a single-page **Authorization & Request for Release of Information** PDF (form-1.pdf), last revised October 2018. This is a generic ROI form — it does not differentiate between patient self-access requests under HIPAA § 164.524 and third-party release authorizations. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no patient portal pathway mentioned on the records page.

The two HIE-related forms (form-2 and form-3) are irrelevant to patient self-access — they govern provider-to-provider data sharing via a health information exchange.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The Patient Records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records), and web searches also surface the direct PDF URL. The page uses accordion sections to organize content, with the ROI form under "JPS Authorization Form." Fee information and submission instructions are disclosed on the page before download — a transparency positive.

## Form Document Quality

The ROI form is the weakest element of JPS's patient access process. It is an **image-only scan** — a photograph of a paper form with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no extractable text (literally 1 character of output from text extraction). At 478 KB for a single page, it is technically a picture, not a document. It cannot be completed digitally, is invisible to screen readers, and fails basic digital accessibility standards.

The irony is sharp: JPS's 2025 HIE forms demonstrate the organization can produce modern, fillable, text-searchable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The core ROI form — the one patients actually need — remains a 2018 scan that has not been updated in over seven years.

The form is one page, which is an appropriate length. However, because it is an image-only scan, detailed analysis of layout, language clarity, field count, and instructions is limited to visual inspection rather than text analysis.

## Access Pathway Assessment

JPS does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The single ROI form appears to serve all release purposes. The fee schedule on the web page does not distinguish between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees (which Texas state law governs at higher rates). This conflation is a significant patient-centeredness gap.

Submission is limited to **print, handwrite, and mail or fax**. The Patient Records page explicitly states: "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time." Fax is available (which counts as an adequate electronic pathway and avoids the worst penalties), but the form itself cannot be filled digitally — it must be printed and handwritten.

## Barriers

- **Potentially excessive fees**: $30 for the first 10 pages, per-page charges thereafter, and a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery. The $75 electronic delivery fee likely exceeds HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based" standard for patient access requests. The fee schedule does not distinguish patient access from third-party requests.
- **No electronic form submission**: Despite having the technical capability (demonstrated by HIE forms accepting encrypted email), JPS refuses electronic submission of the ROI form.
- **Government photo ID required at pickup**: Standard practice but limits delivery to in-person collection.
- **Stale form**: Over 7 years old, predating HHS Right of Access enforcement actions and 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish language version** available for the ROI form, appropriate for Fort Worth demographics.
- **Fee disclosure** is transparent — patients know costs before downloading the form.
- **Easy findability** — the form is prominent and well-organized on the website.
- **HIE forms show capability** — the 2025 HIE forms prove JPS can do better, which makes the outdated ROI form a choice rather than a limitation.

## Overall Assessment

JPS Health Network presents a frustrating contradiction. The organization clearly has the technical capability and institutional will to produce modern, accessible digital forms — the 2025 HIE forms are well-designed, fillable, and accept encrypted email submission. Yet the core ROI form that patients actually need to request their own records remains a seven-year-old image scan with no digital functionality. Combined with potentially excessive fees and no electronic submission, the patient experience is well below what this organization could deliver. The form is easy to find, and fax submission is available, but the document itself is a relic that creates unnecessary barriers for patients exercising their access rights.

# AdventHealth Hendersonville — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Hendersonville is a community hospital in western North Carolina, part of the AdventHealth major nonprofit health system. The facility's primary pathway for medical records requests is a **Swellbox/Datavant online eRequest wizard**, linked from a shared system-wide medical records page. No downloadable PDF form specific to AdventHealth Hendersonville exists. The three PDF forms retrieved during the search all belong to other AdventHealth facilities — two from St. Luke's Hospital in Columbus, NC (~40 miles away) and one from Florida Hospital Heartland Division in Sebring, FL.

## Access Pathway Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville's medical records page (accessible via a footer link on the facility homepage) provides phone, fax, and online eRequest options under the "Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina Locations" tab. The **Swellbox/Datavant wizard** at `swellbox.com/adventhealth-mid-wizard.html` is the primary digital pathway for all records requests. This is an online portal approach — a fully digital request workflow that does not require printing, handwriting, or physically delivering a form.

The facility does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the form discovery level; the Swellbox wizard is the single channel for all request types. Whether the wizard itself differentiates internally is unknown from the available materials. Among the sister-facility PDF forms found, form-1 (St. Luke's "Patient Request for Access") does explicitly separate patient self-access from third-party release — but this form is not linked from AdventHealth Hendersonville's pages and belongs to a different facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms for AdventHealth Hendersonville required **moderate effort**. The medical records page was findable through standard website navigation (footer link), and the Swellbox wizard URL was clearly listed. However, multiple web searches for downloadable PDF forms returned only results from sister facilities, and URL-guessing for Hendersonville-specific PDFs returned 404 errors. The shared system-wide medical records page, with its tabbed regional structure, adds a layer of navigation complexity — a patient must identify the correct regional tab and locate their facility within it. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Since no Hendersonville-specific PDF form exists, the best available PDF for assessment is **form-1 (St. Luke's Patient Request for Access)** — a sister facility form from the same Western NC region. This is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) that must be printed and filled by hand. It has a logical top-to-bottom flow covering patient identification, scope selection, format preferences, and delivery method. The language is plain and patient-friendly ("If you would like a copy of your medical record, please complete the form below"). It offers excellent format options (CD, flash drive, email, paper) and delivery methods (mail, secure email, fax, pickup).

However, the form is dated **June 2016**, still uses pre-rebrand "St. Luke's Hospital" branding, includes the Columbus, NC address, and explicitly states "I am a patient of St. Luke's Hospital." A Hendersonville patient using this form would be submitting a request to the wrong facility.

The primary pathway — the Swellbox wizard — is likely a more functional and appropriate tool for Hendersonville patients, but as an external third-party portal, its internal quality could not be assessed from the downloaded materials.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness** required on the sister-facility forms.
- **Fees**: Not mentioned on form-1; form-2 states "A fee may be charged" without specifying amounts; form-3 mentions fees may apply. No fee schedule was found.
- **SSN collection**: Forms request last 4 digits of SSN (form-1 and form-2) or full SSN (form-3), which is unnecessary for patient access.
- **Submission methods**: The Swellbox wizard provides fully online submission. Fax (828-651-4018) and phone (828-681-2135) are also available. No indication that in-person delivery is required.

## Notable Strengths

- **Online portal pathway**: The Swellbox/Datavant wizard offers a fully digital workflow — no printing, scanning, or faxing required.
- **Multiple contact channels**: Phone, fax, and online options are all clearly listed.
- **Sister facility form quality**: Form-1, though not Hendersonville-specific, demonstrates that AdventHealth's regional forms can be well-designed with good format/delivery options.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No facility-specific PDF form**: A patient who prefers or needs a downloadable form has no Hendersonville-specific option.
- **Wrong-facility forms in search results**: PDF forms from other AdventHealth facilities appear in searches, creating confusion risk.
- **Outdated sister-facility forms**: The available PDFs are 7-10 years old with pre-rebrand branding.
- **System-wide page complexity**: The shared medical records page requires patients to navigate regional tabs to find their facility.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville provides an adequate-to-good patient records request experience through its Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, which represents a modern, portal-based approach. The facility scores well on having an electronic submission pathway and multiple contact options. However, the absence of any facility-specific downloadable form, combined with confusing sister-facility PDFs in search results and a somewhat complex system-wide navigation structure, prevents a top-tier rating. The organization's approach is portal-first by design, which works well for digitally comfortable patients but offers no paper-form fallback specific to this facility.

# Canton-Potsdam Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Canton-Potsdam Hospital (CPH) is a community hospital in Potsdam, NY, operated as part of St. Lawrence Health System (SLH), which was acquired by Rochester Regional Health (RRH). Three documents were retrieved — all from the Wayback Machine, as no forms remain on any live website. The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, a blank New York State OCA Official Form No. 960 ("Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA"). The other two documents are a COVID-specific pre-filled version of the same form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Canton-Potsdam Hospital does **not** offer a differentiated pathway for patient self-access. The only authorization form the organization ever published online was the generic NY State OCA-960, which is designed for third-party release of information — not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. A patient requesting their own records would use the same form as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer, needing to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission tool.

Critically, the parent system's Swellbox/Datavant online records request tool **explicitly excludes** St. Lawrence Health facilities, stating: "St. Lawrence Health is not currently available through this application, for information on requesting these records call (315) 769-4386." This leaves phone as the only visible pathway for patients today.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any form for this organization was extremely difficult. The original SLH website (stlawrencehealthsystem.org) now redirects to rochesterregional.org, where CPH-specific content has not been migrated. Multiple web searches returned no downloadable forms. The only successful strategy was the Wayback Machine CDX API, which identified archived PDFs from the defunct SLH domain. A typical patient would have no realistic way to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2.pdf, blank OCA-960) is a digitally produced PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. Its text layer is severely garbled due to font encoding issues, rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers, search, or copy-paste. Despite being created digitally (via PScript5.dll/Acrobat Distiller), no interactive fields were added, requiring patients to print and handwrite responses.

The form is 2 pages: page 1 is the authorization itself with 13 numbered items; page 2 provides instructions. The structure is logical and reasonably organized, covering patient identification, record scope, recipients, purpose, expiration, and signature. However, the language is formal and legalistic, and the form is not pre-populated with any CPH or SLH contact information — patients must know and fill in the correct provider name and HIM department address themselves.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form includes appropriate compliance elements: explicit voluntariness statement, non-conditioning language, right to revoke in writing, and separate initialing for sensitive categories (HIV, substance abuse, mental health) per NY State law. However, the form header includes a Social Security Number field, which creates unnecessary identity theft risk and is not required by HIPAA. No fees are mentioned on the authorization form itself, though the NPP (form-3) does include HIPAA-compliant fee language limiting electronic copy costs to direct labor.

The form does not specify submission methods, delivery format options, or response timelines. No electronic delivery options are mentioned.

## Notable Strengths

- Uses the standardized NY State OCA-960, ensuring baseline legal compliance
- NPP clearly articulates electronic access rights and EHR-based record availability
- Patient-controlled authorization expiration (by date or event)
- Appropriate sensitive-information opt-in with separate initialing requirements

## Notable Weaknesses

- No ROI form available on any live website; patients must call to initiate requests
- Parent system's online records tool explicitly excludes this facility
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party authorization
- Form has zero fillable fields and a garbled, inaccessible text layer
- SSN field on authorization form creates unnecessary risk
- Organization appears stuck in a transitional state between SLH and RRH infrastructure

## Overall Assessment

Canton-Potsdam Hospital presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in this study. The combination of unfindable forms, a phone-only current pathway, no dedicated patient access process, and technically deficient documents creates substantial barriers for patients seeking their own records. The organizational transition from St. Lawrence Health to Rochester Regional Health has left patients in a gap — excluded from the parent system's digital tools but with no local alternative. A patient today would need to call, navigate an uncertain process, and likely complete a paper form designed for third-party release rather than individual access.

# Grady Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's major public safety-net hospital operating under Grady Health System, provides patients with a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Three PDF documents were found: a current authorization form (form-1, revised 2/22), an older superseded version (form-2, revised 5/15), and a combined instructions-plus-form package (form-3, bundling the older form with a COVID-era cover page). None of these forms are tailored specifically for patient self-access — all are structured as "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information," framing the process as a release between two parties rather than an individual exercising their right of access.

## Access Pathway

Grady does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting someone else's records. All requesters use the same authorization form with identical "Request Information From" / "Release Information To" fields. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively addressing the form to themselves. The form does include "Personal" as a purpose option, and the documentation requirements section on page 2 distinguishes "Patients Requesting Their Own Medical Records" from third-party requests — but this distinction lives in the supporting text, not in the form design itself. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the main authorization form and the medical records page at gradyhealth.org/medical-records/. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without login, bot blocking, or broken links. The medical records page provides clear context for the forms. This earns high marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the current primary form, is a 2-page digitally-created PDF with a text layer and clean layout. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. For a digitally-created document with 12 embedded fonts, this is a missed opportunity. The form is logically organized (demographics → from/to parties → date range → record types → purpose → format/method → legal notices → signature) with clear section delineation. The record type selection offers approximately 25 checkboxes across three categories (Hospital Visits, Office Visits, Diagnostic Imaging), giving patients granular control.

The language is mostly accessible, with the opening instruction plainly stating what the form does. However, the legal sections contain dense language including a broad liability waiver: "I will not hold Grady... responsible for anything that may happen from the use or release of my PHI." The completeness warning — "If any selection is incomplete, this form may be considered invalid" — could discourage submission if patients are uncertain about any field.

## Submission & Delivery

Critically, **submission options are limited to in-person drop-off and postal mail only**. The form-3 cover page explicitly lists only these two options for submitting the completed form. No fax number is provided for form submission, no email submission is available, and no online portal exists. This means a patient cannot complete the entire process without either physically visiting the hospital or waiting for postal mail.

For *receiving* records, options are better: the current form-1 offers encrypted email delivery, paper, CD, mail, pick-up, and fax (continuing care only). Form-3's cover page also references electronic delivery through CIOX Health (now Datavant), with 2-business-day processing for electronic and 7–10 days for mail.

## Barriers & Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The broad liability waiver bundled into the authorization is the most significant concern — patients should not be asked to waive accountability as a condition of records access. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which exceeds what's needed when photo ID is also required. Mandatory government-issued photo ID may burden patients of a safety-net hospital who lack such documentation.

**Bright spots**: The encrypted email delivery option on form-1 is genuinely uncommon and valuable. The form-3 cover page provides excellent operational guidance — processing timelines, fee disclosure ($6.50 max), and the note that continuing care requests are free. Multiple delivery format options (paper, CD, email) give patients real choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

Grady Memorial Hospital makes its forms easy to find and offers some progressive delivery options, but falls short on two critical dimensions: the forms are entirely paper-based (non-fillable, print-and-handwrite only) and submission requires physical delivery. The generic authorization form does not center patient self-access, and the liability waiver raises compliance concerns. For a major public hospital, the absence of any digital submission pathway and the reliance on a third-party release form for patient access represent meaningful barriers. **Grade: C.**

# Bath Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Bath Community Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Hot Springs, Virginia. The organization offers a single ROI form for medical records requests, hosted on its website. No patient portal, online request wizard, or alternative digital pathway was identified.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a one-page "Request of Information" PDF (`form-1.pdf`) branded under **Bath Community Physicians Group** rather than Bath Community Hospital itself. This branding mismatch is common among small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative infrastructure. The form is hosted on the hospital's website at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf` and linked from the Patient Resources → Forms page.

The form is a generic release-of-information authorization — it uses a "Send / Receive" and "To / From" structure designed primarily for inter-provider record transfers, not for patient self-access. A patient wanting their own records would need to adapt the form by marking "Send" and writing in their own name and address as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA individual access rights, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. A targeted web search surfaced the PDF directly, and the hospital's website links to it from a clearly labeled "Medical Records Request" section under Patient Resources. The URL path is descriptive. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. For a small critical access hospital, the form is reasonably discoverable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **scanned paper document** with an OCR text layer — not a digitally-created or fillable PDF. Despite metadata suggesting 21 fillable fields, the field names are empty and the form functions as a flat scan that must be printed and completed by hand. The OCR layer contains numerous errors ("ERNOTE," "LABffEST RESULTS," "IMAGINE REPORTS," "DISHCHARGE SUMMARY"), rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers and text-based search tools.

At one page with approximately 15 patient-completed fields, the form is appropriately brief. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → authorization direction → destination → reason → record type selection → signature block. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records consent paragraph is somewhat dense. No instructions are provided for how to complete or submit the form.

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access requests. This creates a real barrier — a patient must find someone to witness their signature before submitting. The form also requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, raising privacy concerns for a document that may be faxed.

No fees are mentioned. No response time commitment is stated. Submission instructions are absent; the header includes a fax number (540-962-7881), suggesting fax is an available submission method, but this is not explicitly stated. No in-person-only requirement is stated, so fax submission appears available.

## Notable Strengths

The form correctly separates consent for alcohol/drug abuse and psychiatric records into a dedicated checkbox — proper 42 CFR Part 2 practice that many organizations neglect. It also includes a checkbox for patients to request a copy of their signed authorization, a HIPAA requirement that many forms omit.

## Overall Assessment

Bath Community Hospital provides a minimally functional pathway for patients to request their records, but the experience is not patient-centered. The form was designed for provider-to-provider transfers and requires patients to adapt it for self-access. The scanned-image quality, OCR errors, witness requirement, and lack of submission instructions all create friction. While the form is findable and brief, it reflects an older, paper-first approach to health information management typical of small independent facilities. A patient could complete the process, but would receive little guidance and face an unnecessary witness barrier along the way.

# Saratoga Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Saratoga Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Saratoga Springs, NY, now part of the **Albany Med Health System (AMHS)**. Its original website (saratogahospital.org) redirects to albanymed.org/saratoga/. Two authorization forms were found: an older Saratoga Hospital–specific form (form-1.pdf, dated 2020) and the current system-wide AMHS form (form-2.pdf, dated November 2024). The system-wide form is the one actively linked from the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page and is the primary form a patient would encounter today.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release, Not Patient Access

Neither form offers a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both are titled "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" and are structured as third-party release authorizations. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Release Information To" / "Disclose To" field and select a purpose — an awkward workaround for what should be a straightforward right-of-access request. There is no checkbox, section, or simplified flow for "I want my own records." Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or explains patient access rights beyond the right to revoke authorization.

The system-wide form (form-2) does include a sidebar callout to **MyChart** (mychart.albanymed.org), the AMHS patient portal, as an alternative pathway. This is a meaningful digital option, though the form does not clarify what records are accessible through MyChart or whether it satisfies a full records request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A general web search returned direct links, and the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page is accessible without login or bot blocking. The only complexity is the redirect from the Saratoga Hospital domain to Albany Med, which could momentarily confuse a patient searching by the old hospital name. Both PDFs downloaded without difficulty.

## Form Document Quality (Primary: form-2.pdf)

The system-wide form is a strong technical document. It is a digitally constructed PDF (not a scan) with **65 fillable fields** — an unusually high count indicating comprehensive interactive coverage. Patients can complete every field on-screen without printing. The form spans 2 pages with a logical layout: patient demographics → record type selection → facility selection → sensitive information initials → recipient details → delivery method (page 1), then legal disclosures and signatures (page 2).

Record type options are granular (13 categories plus "Other"), and the form includes an "Entire Record" checkbox — an option absent from the older form-1. Delivery methods include email, fax, mail (with CD/USB options), and in-person pick-up. The multi-facility checkboxes let patients specify which AMHS hospital(s) to release from.

The main weakness is page 2: a dense wall of legal text covering revocation rights, HIV/AIDS protections, re-disclosure warnings, and 42 CFR Part 2 — all in small print with no headings, bullets, or visual hierarchy. The language is written at a college reading level. The footer on both pages contains a typo ("Dislcose" instead of "Disclose").

## Barriers

**Fee concern**: Both forms state a **$0.75/page copy fee** (phrased as "$0.75 cents per page" — a formatting error). The fee is waived for physician-to-physician transfers but not explicitly waived for patient self-access. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, per-page fees are generally impermissible; only reasonable cost-based fees are allowed. This is the most significant compliance concern.

**No witness required**: The newer system-wide form (form-2) removed the witness signature line that appeared on the legacy form-1 — a clear improvement.

**No notarization or in-person requirement**: Patients can submit by fax, email, or mail, satisfying the electronic submission baseline.

**No response time stated**: Neither form commits to a turnaround timeline.

## Notable Strengths

- **65 fillable fields** on the primary form — one of the most digitally complete ROI forms encountered
- **MyChart portal alternative** mentioned directly on the form
- **Granular record type and sensitive-information controls** with separate initials for HIV, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing
- **Multi-facility coverage** — a single form for all four AMHS hospitals reduces confusion

## Overall Assessment

Saratoga Hospital, via the Albany Med Health System, provides a technically polished and easily findable authorization form with excellent fillable-field coverage and a MyChart alternative. However, the experience is undermined by the complete absence of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must navigate a third-party release framework to exercise their individual access rights. The $0.75/page fee applied without distinguishing patient access from third-party release is a compliance concern. The form is a solid B-level document in terms of technical quality, but the lack of patient-centeredness and fee ambiguity hold back the overall score.

# Northwest Colorado Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Northwest Colorado Health is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms on its website: one for behavioral health records (form-1) and one for medical/dental records (form-2). Both are single-page PDFs available from a dedicated patient forms page. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient-access form — both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any release of information, whether to the patient themselves or to a third party.

## Access Pathway

Northwest Colorado Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Request Information FROM" / "Release Information TO" structure, treating a patient requesting their own records identically to someone authorizing release to an insurer, attorney, or another provider. The "Release Information TO" section does list "Self / Legal Guardian" as a pre-printed option, which at least acknowledges that patients may be the intended recipient, but the form's structure, legal language, and scope options are all oriented toward the general authorization use case.

Patients who received both medical and behavioral health services at this facility would need to complete **two separate forms** — a meaningful friction point not faced by those seeking release to a single third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped web search located the patient forms page at a logical URL path (`/what_you_can_do/patient-resources/patient-forms/english.html`). Both forms were publicly linked, downloadable without authentication, and no bot-blocking or CAPTCHA was encountered. The download URLs are GUID-based and not human-readable, but this is a minor cosmetic issue.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form for patient self-access is form-2 (Medical and/or Dental), as it covers the broadest category of records most patients would seek. Key observations:

- **Fillability:** Despite metadata reporting 43 field annotations, the form is functionally a flat PDF — not practically fillable. Patients must print and complete by hand.
- **Length:** A single page, which is commendably concise. However, this compresses a substantial amount of content into a tight layout.
- **Language:** The introductory paragraph is notably patient-friendly: "We value your privacy at Northwest Colorado Health. Legally, we cannot release your written health record to anyone (including you) without your specific consent." The tone shifts to denser legal language in the six numbered disclaimers but remains reasonably readable.
- **Layout:** Logically organized with clear sections — patient info, FROM/TO entities, record types, purpose, sensitive-information authorization, signature, and legal paragraphs. Checkbox-driven options for record types and disclosure purposes reduce writing burden.
- **Instructions:** The form provides adequate contextual guidance but lacks explicit step-by-step instructions. Critically, it provides **no submission instructions** — a patient who downloads and completes the form has no guidance on where or how to send it (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link for submission).

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection:** Both forms request the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for identity verification under HIPAA and creates a data security risk.
- **No submission method stated:** The absence of submission instructions is a significant barrier. The Privacy Officer's mailing address appears only in the revocation clause, not as a submission destination.
- **No fee disclosure:** The forms neither mention fees nor state that patient access is free, leaving cost ambiguity.
- **Legacy organization name:** The revocation section refers to "Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association," the organization's former name, which could confuse patients despite the form's 04/2020 revision date.

## Bright Spots

- **Fast processing commitment:** "Up to 48 business hours" (~6 business days) is well within HIPAA's 30-day window and more specific and faster than most organizations promise.
- **Plain-language introduction:** The opening paragraph is warm, clear, and patient-friendly — significantly better than the legalistic openings common on ROI forms.
- **Photocopy validity:** The form states that photocopies are as valid as originals, reducing barriers for patients.
- **Non-retaliation statement:** Clearly states that care and payment will not be affected by declining to sign.
- **Easy findability:** Forms are publicly accessible without login or barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Northwest Colorado Health provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find, concise, and written with an unusually patient-friendly tone. However, the organization funnels all requests through a generic authorization form with no differentiation for patient self-access, collects unnecessary SSNs, provides no submission instructions, and offers only a print-and-handwrite workflow. The split into two separate forms by record category adds friction for patients. This is a typical small independent FQHC approach — adequate but not designed with the patient's individual access rights as a first-class concern.

# San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center — Synthesis

## Overview

San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center (SLV Health-RMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Alamosa, Colorado, part of the San Luis Valley Health regional system that also includes Conejos County Hospital (La Jara). The organization makes three PDF forms available online: a current English-language authorization form (form-1), a superseded 2013 English version (form-2, still publicly accessible but no longer linked), and a Spanish-language translation (form-3). All three are generic "Authorization to Release Medical Record Information" forms — none is designed specifically for patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Access Pathway

SLV Health does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All three forms use a "RELEASE FROM" / "RELEASE TO" structure designed for authorizing disclosure to a named recipient — an attorney, insurer, or other provider. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves in the "RELEASE TO" field, which is workable but unintuitive. There is no checkbox, pathway, or language acknowledging that a patient might simply want to access their own health information. No patient portal or online request wizard is offered for records requests.

The primary pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, then email the completed form to `MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org` or mail it to the facility. The email submission option is a meaningful convenience that prevents the need for in-person delivery.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **very easy**. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the organization's Medical Records page (`/patient-center/medical-records/`) clearly links to both the English and Spanish authorization forms. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only concern is that the older form-2 remains publicly accessible at its original URL and could surface in search results, potentially confusing patients about which version to use.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with extractable text — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are visual underlines meant for handwriting, and there is a "Patient Sticker" area intended for in-facility paper workflows. The form cannot be completed electronically within the PDF itself. This is clearly a print-oriented document.

The layout is dense but logically organized, flowing from facility identification through patient info, record type selection (six categories with initial-based checkboxes), expiration options, sensitive-condition authorization, and signature block. The language is moderately legalistic but generally understandable — the authorization statement is reasonably clear. Section headers provide hierarchy, though the initial-based checkbox convention `( )` requires familiarity.

The form lacks instructions or guidance text, offers no statement of patient rights, and makes no reference to HIPAA, turnaround times, or fees.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests Social Security Numbers as a standard identification field alongside name and date of birth — unnecessary for a records release authorization and creating identity theft risk. This is particularly concerning given the community's demographics.

The vague disclaimer **"San Luis Valley Health is not responsible if lost"** is poorly worded and could deter patients from submitting forms remotely. The **copies clause** (MAY/MAY NOT be used with same effectiveness as original) places an opaque legal decision on patients. A persistent **spelling error** ("INFORMATION REQUIRIED") has survived at least two revision cycles, suggesting limited quality control.

No notarization is required. No in-person submission is required. No fees are disclosed — neither their presence nor absence is mentioned.

## Bright Spots

The **Spanish-language form** is a genuine strength. It is co-located with the English version on the Medical Records page, requiring no extra navigation — appropriate and commendable for a community hospital serving the San Luis Valley's significant Latino population. The **email submission option** lowers the barrier compared to fax-only or mail-only processes. The **single-page design** is efficient, and the **granular record-type options** give patients meaningful control over scope.

## Overall Assessment

SLV Health-RMC earns credit for easy findability, bilingual support, and email submission — things many organizations fail to provide. However, the lack of a patient-specific access pathway, absence of fillable fields, SSN collection, and missing rights information keep this solidly in the middle tier. A patient can navigate the process, but the organization hasn't designed it with patient self-access in mind. The form serves its historical purpose as a generic release authorization; it has not evolved to meet the expectations of a patient-centered digital healthcare landscape. **Grade: C.**

# CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital is a critical access hospital in Long Prairie, MN, part of the CentraCare regional health system based in St. Cloud. Long Prairie does not maintain its own facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it uses CentraCare's system-wide "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available from a centralized medical records release page at centracare.com. Three documents were found: the main ROI authorization form, a companion instruction sheet, and a separate substance use disorder consent form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

CentraCare does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for all releases of information — to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the "Release Information From" and "Release Information To" fields, placing themselves in the "To" field — an unintuitive workflow for someone who simply wants a copy of their own chart. There is no separate patient access request form, no dedicated section for individual access, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

That said, the form does include a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which normalizes patient self-requests and helps HIM staff route them appropriately. The companion instruction document (form-2) provides clear, section-by-section guidance written in second person, explaining not just *what* to fill in but *why* each field matters — an unusual and helpful touch.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. Web searches converged on CentraCare's centralized patient resources page, which logically organizes the forms. However, a patient searching specifically for "Long Prairie Hospital medical records form" must recognize that Long Prairie uses system-wide CentraCare forms and navigate accordingly. Direct download via automated tools (`curl`) was blocked by bot protection, requiring browser-based retrieval — a concern for assistive technologies and non-standard browsers.

## Form Document Quality

The main authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, despite its digital origins, it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand, or use third-party PDF annotation tools. This is a significant gap for a regional health system. The form has approximately 15–20 fields across patient demographics, release from/to addresses, record type checkboxes, delivery method, reason for release, and signature/date.

The layout is clean and logically structured: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Information to be Released → Special Disclosure → Preferred Method → Reason → Authorization → Revocation. Page 2 provides a comprehensive directory of all CentraCare HIM offices organized by region with fax numbers, phone, mail addresses, and a shared email. The language is mostly accessible, though the revocation paragraph contains dense legalese that may confuse patients.

## Submission and Delivery

CentraCare offers strong submission and delivery options. Completed forms can be submitted by **email** (CCHROI@CentraCare.com), **fax**, or **mail** — email submission is prominently featured and works for all locations. Records can be delivered via paper, CD, encrypted email, or MyChart portal. This is a genuinely patient-friendly set of options, particularly the encrypted email and MyChart delivery channels.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person submission requirement. No fee information is disclosed on either the form or the instructions, though the instructions reference "who may be responsible for the cost of records" without specifying amounts. No response time commitment is stated. The anti-re-release clause ("I do not authorize re-release of this information to anyone") is embedded as non-optional boilerplate rather than a patient choice. The form-3 SUD consent is an image-only scan with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers — but this is a supplementary document, not the primary pathway.

## Overall Assessment

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital provides a **functional but not patient-centered** records request process. The strong points are the multiple electronic submission channels (especially email), diverse delivery options (MyChart, encrypted email), the "Personal Use" reason checkbox, and the unusually helpful instruction document. The weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable form requiring print-and-handwrite, the absence of fee disclosure, and the lack of any patient rights information. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was designed for third-party release and the patient must adapt to it. Grade: **B**.

# University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two versions of the same form were found: **Form 1989 ("ADMIN – Consent to Release of Information and Right of Access Request")**. Form-1 is the current official version (revised May 2024), hosted on the university's healthcare domain. Form-2 is an older revision (August 2021) hosted on a third-party CDN, pre-populated for a driving rehabilitation service ("Safer Driver Solutions"). Form-1 is the canonical, patient-facing document; form-2 is irrelevant for direct patient self-access and is included only for completeness.

The organization directs patients to a clear medical records request page at `uihc.org/medical-records-request`, which links to the PDF form and provides submission instructions. Submission options include email (`him-consentform@uiowa.edu`), fax (two numbers), and physical mail — a notably flexible set of channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form title explicitly names both functions: "Consent to Release of Information **AND** Right of Access Request." This dual-purpose naming is unusual and shows awareness that patients may exercise their HIPAA right of access. However, the form body does not differentiate the two use cases. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no separate workflow, and — critically — no "send records to myself" shortcut. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Send UI Health Care information to" field, effectively treating themselves as a third party. Ironically, the older form-2 included a "Myself at the address above unless noted below" option, which the current revision dropped.

The organization does not distinguish between individual access requests (governed by HIPAA § 164.524) and third-party authorization (governed by § 164.508) in its process or documentation. This is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that acknowledges patient access in name only.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF link. The official medical records page provides clear context and instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, CAPTCHAs, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, natively digital PDF with a clean text layer (4,233 characters). Despite being digitally created, it has **zero fillable fields** — a significant regression from the older form-2, which had 50 fillable fields. Patients must print the form, complete it by hand, scan it, and then submit electronically (email or fax) or by mail. The form's consent language acknowledges electronic completion ("as valid as if you signed the consent in writing"), creating a paradox: the form claims to support electronic completion but provides no interactive fields to enable it.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient → format options → record types → date range → reason → consent → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Sections are spatially separated but lack labeled headers. The language is generally clear, though the consent block contains moderately dense legal prose. Record type options are comprehensive (16+ checkboxes), and the form thoughtfully includes legacy entity lines for patients who received care under prior organizational names (Corridor OB GYN, Mercy Clinics, Mercy Hospital).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states a 30-day response commitment, aligning with HIPAA requirements. The non-conditioning statement is present and properly worded. Fee disclosure is vague: "I understand there may be a charge for this information" — without distinguishing between patient access fees (limited under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. Revocation requires written notification to the Director of Health Information Management, a minor but unnecessary barrier.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Exceptional findability. Multiple electronic submission channels including email. Dual-purpose form title acknowledging right of access. Legacy entity lines accommodating merged organizations. Comprehensive record type selection. Five delivery format options including electronic media (CD, USB, email).

**Red flags**: The current official form regressed from 50 fillable fields to zero — a clear step backward in digital accessibility. The removal of the "Myself" recipient option from the current form makes patient self-access less intuitive than in the older version. Vague fee language fails to inform patients of their right to cost-based fees under HIPAA.

## Overall Assessment

University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics earns credit for excellent findability, multiple submission channels, and a form that at least names patient access in its title. However, the lack of fillable fields on the current form, the absence of a differentiated patient self-access pathway, and the regression from the more interactive older version weigh against it. The organization provides an adequate but not patient-centered experience — a patient can get their records, but must navigate a form designed primarily for third-party authorization using a print-and-fill workflow.

# Riverside Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Riverside Community Hospital, an HCA Healthcare facility in Riverside, CA, provides three downloadable authorization forms for medical records release. **Form-2** (English, 1 page, 52 fillable fields) is the current official document, linked directly from the hospital's [medical records page](https://www.riversidecommunityhospital.com/patient-resources/medical-records). **Form-3** is a Spanish-language equivalent with identical structure and field count. **Form-1** is an older, 5-page non-fillable version hosted by a third-party ROI vendor (Legal Image) that is no longer linked from the hospital's website. The retrieval notes also mention a MyHealthONE patient portal and a Swellbox-based online request wizard, though the PDF forms remain the primary documented pathway.

## Patient Self-Access vs. Third-Party Release

Riverside Community Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization for Release of PHI" documents designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-2 does include a checkbox distinguishing "At the request of the individual" from "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form's overall structure still centers on designating a separate "Recipient" — a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own name and address as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 (right of access), no mention of the 30-day response deadline for patient access requests, and no distinction in fee treatment between patient access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HCA corporate template (HCA-840-00434), not something designed with the patient self-request experience in mind.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy** — the medical records page is accessible within 1-2 clicks from the main website under Patient Resources. Both English and Spanish forms are directly linked as downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that form-1 is served over HTTP (not HTTPS) by the third-party vendor, but this is not the primary form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is technically strong. It is a genuinely digital-first, fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields — checkboxes, radio buttons, and text fields — all on a single page. A patient can complete the form on-screen without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (A: authorization details, B: marketing/PHI sale, C: signatures), with 16 granular record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. The language is formal and clinical but generally comprehensible. However, the single-page format makes the form quite dense, and there are no standalone instructions or guidance text on the form itself (unlike form-1's two-page instruction set). The USCDI release request option is a rare and forward-looking inclusion, though the technical jargon ("Requires Direct Address or National Provider Identifier") would be meaningless to most patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. No notarization or witness signature is required. Submission can be made by mail (to HCA's Nashville, TN processing center) or by fax, satisfying the baseline for electronic submission. The SSN field is present but marked optional. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("a reasonable copy fee") without specifying amounts or distinguishing patient access from third-party release. No response time commitment is stated. The centralized Nashville mailing address means local submission is not mentioned on the current form, though a patient could potentially submit in person at the hospital's HIM department.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language parity**: Form-3 is a fully equivalent Spanish version with the same 52 fillable fields — genuine language access for Riverside's majority-Hispanic community.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare among ROI forms and signals awareness of interoperability standards.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure).
- **52 fillable fields**: Among the most technically complete fillable forms observed.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Patients are funneled through the same generic authorization form used for insurance companies and attorneys.
- **No right-of-access language**: The form never informs patients of their HIPAA right to access their own records or the associated protections (fee limits, 30-day timeline).
- **Centralized processing**: All requests route to Nashville, TN — no local submission address on the current form.
- **Grammar error persists**: "obtain a copy the information" (missing "of") appears across all form versions.

## Overall Assessment

Riverside Community Hospital delivers a technically competent but patient-generic records request experience. The fillable PDF, Spanish-language version, and multiple delivery options represent genuine strengths. However, the organization treats patient self-access as just another type of third-party release, missing an opportunity to provide a streamlined, patient-centered pathway. A patient can get their records through this process, but they receive no guidance tailored to their situation and may not understand their rights. The overall experience earns a **B** — solid technical execution held back by a one-size-fits-all approach to records access.

The primary form is **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form 8094, rev. 2/2026) — a system-wide ROI authorization covering all 11 NMHC hospitals, physician groups, and behavioral health locations. **Form-3.pdf** is a full Spanish translation of the same form (8094SP, rev. 8/2024). **Form-2.pdf** is a separate inbound records request form for transferring records *into* NMHC from other providers — not relevant for patient self-access.

All forms are published at the system level on nm.org and are used across all NMHC entities. Northwestern Memorial Hospital does not maintain facility-specific forms.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Northwestern Medicine does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to attorneys, insurers, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" as the purpose, then list themselves as the recipient in the "Send Information To" section. This is functional but unintuitive: the form was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) anywhere on the form. This matters because Right of Access requests carry different fee limits and timing requirements than third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was trivially easy. A basic web search returned direct download links to the PDFs hosted on nm.org's media CDN. No website navigation, login, CAPTCHA, or bot-blocking was encountered. The URLs are descriptive and the forms are well-organized in the patients-and-visitors section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **79 fillable fields** — text inputs, checkboxes, and date fields can all be completed digitally without printing. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → facility selection → purpose → record types → delivery method → medical images → recipient → legal disclosures → signatures. Record-type categories include helpful parenthetical explanations (e.g., "Hospital Stay (History and physical, progress notes, consultations, operative reports, discharge summary, test results)") that help patients understand what they're requesting. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The legal disclosure section is moderately dense but covers required elements: 30-day response window, right to revoke, no care denial for refusal to sign, and sensitive-record opt-outs (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic testing, mental health). The language is somewhat complex but not impenetrably legalistic.

## Submission and Delivery

Submission options are strong: mail (Winfield, IL), fax (312.926.3093), and email (releaseofinformation@nm.org). Delivery options are notably forward-looking: **MyNM patient portal**, fax, email, and US mail (CD or paper). The portal delivery option is a standout feature that removes a common access barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or in-person requirements exist. Fees are referenced vaguely — "Standard record copying fees per 735 ILCS 5/8-2006 may apply" — without specific amounts or clarification that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a cost-based amount. This ambiguity could lead patients to expect the (higher) Illinois statutory copying fees even for personal-use requests.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form** with the same 82 fillable fields — Spanish-speaking patients get equal digital functionality
- **MyNM portal delivery** alongside fax, email, and mail
- **Email submission** (still uncommon among healthcare organizations)
- **Memorable toll-free number**: 877.9RECORD with TTY: 711 support
- **Parenthetical record-type explanations** helping patients understand each category

## Notable Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway — generic authorization form for all release types
- No reference to HIPAA Right of Access or patient access rights
- Fee language references Illinois statute without distinguishing patient-access fee limits
- Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version (missing hospital renaming, updated 42 CFR Part 2 language, and TTY reference)

## Overall Assessment

Northwestern Medicine provides a technically strong, easy-to-find form ecosystem with excellent digital features (fillable fields, email submission, portal delivery, Spanish translation). The primary weakness is structural: the organization channels all records requests — including patient self-access — through a generic authorization form designed for third-party release, without acknowledging the distinct rights and fee limits that apply to individual access under HIPAA. The form works well for patients who know what they need, but it wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Providence St. Vincent Medical Center does not publish facility-specific ROI forms. All record request forms are managed at the parent system level by Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), a major nonprofit health system spanning seven states. Three overlapping forms were found on the Providence HIM page:

1. **Form-1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" (ORC 240A, rev. 03/20): A general-purpose ROI authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Includes a "Self" checkbox but is framed around disclosure to others.
2. **Form-2** — "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" (940507, dated 3/27/25): A dedicated patient access form with updated PSJH branding and R1RCM vendor contact info. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
3. **Form-3** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" (rev. 03/20): An older OR/MT-specific patient access form that form-2 appears to supersede, with outdated PH&S branding and contact information.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence meaningfully distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Form-2 is explicitly titled as a "Patient Request to Access" and defaults to disclosure "to Myself" as the first option. This is a genuine dedicated patient access form — not a generic authorization repurposed with a self-access checkbox. However, the general authorization (form-1) is more easily found via web search, meaning a patient may encounter the less appropriate form first. The HIM page does not clearly guide patients toward form-2 over form-1.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required pivoting from the facility name to the parent system. A search for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center" did not surface ROI forms directly — searchers had to navigate to the system-level HIM page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management`. Once found, this page is comprehensive, listing multiple forms with instructions. However, the presence of three overlapping forms with no clear guidance on which is current creates confusion. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2, the primary patient access form, is a well-constructed digital document. At 3 pages and 72 fillable fields, it is genuinely interactive — patients can complete nearly every field digitally before printing for signature. The layout uses clearly labeled sections (patient information, use and disclosure, record type selection, rights statement, signature) with capitalized headers. Record type options are helpfully tiered: "Pertinent information" (with an explanatory list of common record types) versus "All/Entire Medical Record," plus an "Other" field and "Last two years only" option.

The language is mostly clear, though the title uses the HIPAA term "Designated Record Set" rather than plain-language alternatives. The opening warning — "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — is somewhat intimidating without clarifying which fields are required versus optional.

Five delivery options are offered: MyChart, Paper (Mailed), CD (Mailed), FAX, and Email. Including MyChart is a notable patient-friendly touch. Submission can be made by mail, email (ROIHIMreception@r1rcm.com), or fax — no in-person visit is required.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable barrier is the wet-signature requirement on forms 1 and 3, though form-2 may accept electronic signatures (it lacks the explicit "Print form and sign by hand" instruction found on the others). Fees are disclosed vaguely — "there may be a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access.

A potential red flag appears in form-2's internal "HOSPITAL USE ONLY" section, which includes a physician approval/denial workflow for record release. Under HIPAA § 164.524, denial of patient access is permitted only in narrow circumstances; a blanket physician-approval gate could constitute an unreasonable barrier if applied broadly.

The continued publication of the outdated form-3 alongside form-2, with different contact information and organizational branding, risks sending patients to non-functional channels.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from general third-party authorization
- **72 fillable interactive fields** on the primary form — genuinely digital-first design
- **Five delivery format options** including MyChart and email
- **Multilingual language assistance notices** in English, Spanish, and Chinese
- **Multiple submission channels** (mail, email, fax) with no in-person requirement
- **Comprehensive HIM page** with centralized ROI processing

## Overall Assessment

Providence St. Vincent, through its parent system, provides an above-average patient record request experience. The existence of a dedicated patient access form with strong digital fillability and multiple delivery options demonstrates genuine attention to patient needs. The main weaknesses are findability (requiring navigation from facility to system-level resources), form proliferation without clear versioning guidance, vague fee disclosures, and the physician-approval gate embedded in form-2's workflow. A patient who finds form-2 will have a good experience; the challenge is ensuring they find it.

# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Anchorage, Alaska. Two documents were retrieved from its publicly accessible forms page: a primary ROI authorization form ("Advanced Authorization for Release of Information," Rev. 08/2025) and a standing PHI Disclosure Agreement (Rev. 8/4/23). Of these, form-1 is the relevant document for a patient requesting copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

ANHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary ROI form (form-1) is a dual-purpose generic HIPAA authorization covering both "obtain information from" an external source and "release information to" a third party. A patient wanting their own records must check "Release Information to" and fill in their own name and address as the recipient — functional, but not intuitive. The form's instructions frame it around sending records elsewhere, not around the patient's individual Right of Access. There is no separate, simplified pathway for patients who just want their own records.

That said, the form does include a notably strong patient-rights statement: it explicitly cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and tells patients they are "NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information." This is uncommon and commendable, partially compensating for the generic form structure.

The retrieval notes also mention a text-based ROI request option (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which could be a more accessible alternative channel, though its scope and workflow aren't detailed on the forms page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped search surfaced the ANHC forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms), which is well-organized with clear section headings including a "Request a Release of Information" section with direct PDF links. No bot blocking, captchas, or authentication barriers were encountered. The form was also available in Spanish, which is a notable accessibility feature for an FQHC. Difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally composed document — not a scan — with a clean text layer and reasonable file size (164 KB). However, despite being revised as recently as August 2025, it has **zero fillable PDF fields**. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and return it via fax or in person. This is a significant missed opportunity for a document that is clearly digitally designed.

The form collects approximately 15 fields: patient name, DOB, last four SSN digits, two phone numbers, full address, recipient information, record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization, date range, and signature. Requesting SSN digits is unnecessary for a records request and adds friction. The form fits everything on one page, which is efficient but dense. Layout is adequate with clear section divisions, though the volume of content compressed onto a single page limits whitespace.

Language is generally accessible. The introductory "PLEASE READ" paragraph is clear and plain-language. The legal disclosure section is denser but not impenetrable, covering authorization voluntariness, expiration, revocation rights, and redisclosure prohibitions. There is a typo ("heath care" instead of "health care") and a malformed HIPAA citation in the legal text.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Fees**: The form discloses that ANHC charges for copies, with an exception for facility-to-facility transfers. It does not clarify that patient self-access requests are subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee limits, which could discourage patients.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting the last four SSN digits is unnecessary and creates friction.
- **No notarization** required — positive.
- **Submission**: Fax (907-743-7255) is available as an electronic submission method. The form also lists the physical address. No email or portal submission option exists for the ROI form itself, though ANHC does use MyChart (referenced in form-2).
- **Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit HIPAA Right of Access citation** (45 CFR § 164.524) with clear patient-empowering language
- **Spanish-language version** of the ROI form available
- **Text-message alternative** for initiating ROI requests
- **Recently revised** (08/2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Adolescent privacy protections** on form-2 (MyChart proxy access controls for minors 12–17)

## Overall Assessment

ANHC presents a mixed picture. The forms are easy to find, the website is well-organized, and several bright spots — Spanish availability, text-message option, explicit HIPAA rights language — show genuine attention to patient access. However, the core pathway funnels patients through a generic third-party authorization form rather than offering a dedicated patient self-access route, the primary PDF has no fillable fields despite recent revision, and the fee language could discourage patients from exercising their rights. For an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations, the lack of a fillable digital form is a notable gap. The organization earns credit for accessibility features and rights transparency, but falls short on digital form quality and access pathway differentiation.

# Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, a ScionHealth-affiliated for-profit community hospital in Hartsville, SC, offers two publicly available ROI forms: an English "Release of Information Authorization / Requisition Form" (form-1.pdf) and an identical Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are hosted on ScionHealth's CMS infrastructure and linked directly from the hospital's medical records page at cprmc.com/medical-records. No additional patient access forms, online portals, or digital request wizards were found. The hospital uses MRO Corp as its third-party ROI vendor for processing requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms structured around a "disclosing provider → recipient" model. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the "Name of Recipient" section with their own information — a workflow designed for third-party disclosure, not individual access. The form references 45 CFR 160 and 164 only in the context of redisclosure risk and never mentions HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524). There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no simplified self-request form, and no portal-based alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-specific web search immediately surfaced both PDF URLs, and the medical records page provides direct links alongside submission instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, or multi-click navigation was encountered. File names are descriptive (`Authorization_Update_(English).pdf`). This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — but with **zero fillable fields**. Every field must be completed by printing and handwriting. The layout is organized into two sections: Section A for patient and recipient demographics plus record type selection, and Section B for seven legal statements with a signature block. The 15-category record type checklist (face sheet, H&P, labs, imaging, etc.) with an "All Records" option provides good granularity. However, the single-page format forces dense layout with limited whitespace, and the legal statements use moderately complex language referencing CFR provisions. The form lacks instructions beyond section labels, provides no guidance on how patients will receive their records, and includes a "purpose/reason for this request" field without noting that HIPAA does not require patients to justify self-access requests.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable red flags emerge. First, Statement 6 states that patients "may need to have my physician authorize" the use or disclosure of sensitive information in their records — language that could function as an illegitimate barrier to patient access under HIPAA's Right of Access. Second, the "For Office Use Only" section includes a Social Security number field, creating unnecessary data exposure risk. The form discloses no fees, states no response timeline, and does not mention the MRO Corp third-party vendor relationship. On the positive side, no notarization is required, and submission channels include fax and email in addition to in-person delivery — adequate electronic submission options.

## Notable Strengths

The availability of a professionally translated Spanish-language form is a genuine bright spot, particularly for a community hospital. Both language versions are equally accessible from the medical records page. The granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control over their request scope. The easy online findability — direct links, descriptive URLs, no access barriers — represents a model for form availability.

## Overall Assessment

Carolina Pines provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and submit, and the Spanish translation is commendable. However, the lack of any patient self-access differentiation, zero fillable fields, concerning physician-gating language for sensitive records, and absence of fee or timeline transparency place this organization squarely in the middle tier. A patient can navigate this process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital (Richmond, VA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital is part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system and uses system-wide forms for its Richmond-area facilities. Two PDF forms were found: an English-language "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" (form-1.pdf, BSR-MR-50, rev. 1/21) and a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2.pdf, BSR-MR-50SPN, rev. 11/17). Both are single-page, non-fillable PDFs linked directly from the system's medical records page. Beyond the PDF forms, Bon Secours also offers an online request pathway via Ciox/Swellbox and MyChart patient portal access, giving patients three distinct channels to request records.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

The PDF form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for third-party disclosure — the structure asks the patient to authorize a facility "TO DISCLOSE" information to a named recipient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly name themselves as both authorizer and recipient, navigating a form whose conceptual framework doesn't match their use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form.

That said, the form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an "eDelivery by Ciox (for patient's only)" delivery option specifically marked as patient-exclusive. These suggest some awareness of the patient self-access use case, but the form itself was not redesigned around it. The availability of Ciox/Swellbox as an online portal likely represents a more patient-centered pathway, though it was not evaluated in detail as it is a web-based tool rather than a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately surfaced the Bon Secours medical records page at `bonsecours.com/patient-resources/request-medical-records`, where both PDF forms are directly linked alongside information about online and MyChart options. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The URL path (`roi-form-2017.ashx`) is somewhat opaque but the page itself is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (form-1.pdf) is a digitally-authored, single-page PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. The layout is compact and logically ordered: demographics → record types → recipient → delivery format → purpose → legal terms → signature. The top half uses clear, short labels; the bottom half shifts to dense legal language across four numbered paragraphs. Twelve record-type checkboxes plus two "Other" fields provide good scope granularity. Five delivery format options (US Mail, CD/DVD, Radiology Film/CD, MyChart, Ciox eDelivery) are notably generous.

The Spanish version mirrors the English form but lags by over three years (November 2017 vs. January 2021), contains several untranslated English field labels ("Anesthesia Record," "Radiology Film/CD"), and has a minor typographical error (double closing parenthesis). While the existence of a Spanish form is commendable, the version discrepancy raises concerns about whether Spanish-speaking patients receive equivalent information.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees are vaguely stated**: "copying charges will be applied, according to the hospital policy" — with no specific amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) and third-party release fees. This is a compliance concern.
- **No response time stated** on the form.
- **Fax submission is available** (fax number listed in notes: 804-673-9561), so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multilingual availability**: English and Spanish forms linked from the same page — better than most organizations.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Five options including MyChart and Ciox eDelivery with email, going well beyond the typical mail-or-fax binary.
- **Multiple request channels**: PDF form, Ciox/Swellbox online portal, and MyChart portal give patients real choice.
- **Single-page efficiency**: All necessary content on one page reduces patient burden.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference**: The form cites the HIPAA Right of Access provision, which is uncommon and helpful.

## Weaknesses

- **Generic disclosure form, not patient-access form**: The form is conceptually designed for third-party release, forcing patients to adapt.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form lacks any interactive fields — a missed opportunity.
- **Vague fee language**: No fee schedule, no patient-access fee distinction.
- **Spanish version outdated**: Three-year lag behind English version with untranslated fields.

## Overall Assessment

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The form is easy to find, compact, and offers unusually good delivery options including electronic delivery for patients. The multilingual availability and multiple request channels (PDF, Swellbox, MyChart) are genuine strengths. However, the core PDF form remains a generic third-party authorization that doesn't center the patient self-access use case, it lacks fillable fields, and its fee language falls short of HIPAA transparency standards. The overall experience is adequate but not exemplary — a patient can get their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary user.

# Synthesis: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center

## Forms and Pathways

OSU Wexner Medical Center publishes two PDF forms on its [Medical Records page](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records), both titled "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (form ID MC040184, revised 11/2019). Form-1 is a single-page image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields — essentially a digitized paper artifact. Form-2 is a two-page digitally authored PDF that bundles numbered instructions (page 1) with the same authorization form (page 2). Form-2 has a full text layer and 25 embedded fonts but, despite being created in Adobe Acrobat Pro, still has zero fillable fields. Both forms use the same layout and legal text. Form-2 is clearly the better document and serves as the basis for this assessment.

The organization does not appear to offer a patient portal-based records request, an online submission wizard (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), or any other digital request pathway. Submission instructions list three physical mailing addresses and phone numbers for the Medical Information Management offices. No fax number or email address is listed for submitting the completed form. The form does accept eSignatures ("e.g., Adobe") with a date and time stamp, which opens the possibility that a patient could fill the form digitally using annotation tools and email or fax it — but no such submission channel is explicitly provided on the form itself.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

OSU Wexner does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same "Authorization to Release Medical Information" form is used whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney, insurer, or other third party is requesting them. The form's "Release Information To" section uses a sender-recipient model without any acknowledgment that a patient requesting their own records has distinct rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). There is no mention of the Right of Access anywhere on either form. Patients must complete the same "Purpose of Disclosure" field (with no guidance that they are not legally required to state a purpose for their own records), select facilities, and navigate the same legal text as any third-party requester.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned direct download links on the first attempt, and the forms are clearly linked from the organization's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor friction is the presence of two versions of the same form without guidance on which to use — a patient might download the image-only scan (form-1) and have a worse experience.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2's instructions page is a genuine bright spot: seven numbered items correspond to form sections, with practical guidance like "If uncertain about the location, select all box locations." The form itself offers granular record-type checkboxes (11 categories including Emergency Dept, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, Radiology, Pathology, etc.), multi-facility selection across 8 OSU locations, and reasonable purpose-of-disclosure options. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the form page is quite dense — it packs all fields, checkboxes, four paragraphs of legal text, signature lines, and three submission address blocks onto a single page, resulting in small font sizes and cramped spacing. The language mixes accessible instructions with HIPAA-derived terms ("designated record set," "re-disclosed by the recipient") that may confuse patients. Critically, despite being authored in Acrobat Pro, the form has no fillable fields — patients must print and handwrite.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is fee opacity. The form states "a fee may be charged" and directs all billing questions to CIOX Health (1-800-367-1500), a third-party ROI vendor, without any fee schedule or distinction between patient-access and third-party fees. For patient self-access, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts; the lack of transparency here raises concerns. The instructions require "all sections must be completed in their entirety," which means patients must state a purpose — not required by HIPAA for individual access. No notarization is required, and the witness signature is optional, which is positive. The form has not been updated since November 2019, predating the 2021 information blocking rules and 2024 42 CFR Part 2 revisions.

## Bright Spots

- Dedicated, well-structured instructions page with numbered items
- Granular record-type selection (11 categories)
- Multi-facility selection with practical guidance for uncertain patients
- eSignature acceptance (Adobe)
- Correct substance use disorder and psychotherapy notes disclosures

## Overall Assessment

OSU Wexner Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably organized ROI form with useful instructions, but falls short on digital accessibility (no fillable fields, no electronic submission channel), patient-centeredness (no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release), and fee transparency. The process is fundamentally a print-and-mail paper workflow dressed in a PDF wrapper.

# Michigan Medicine – University of Michigan Health: Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Michigan Medicine provides three publicly available forms related to medical records, though only one is relevant for patient self-access. **Form-1** (70-10015, VER: A/24) is the current "Authorization to Release Copies of a Medical Record," a 3-page document that serves as the primary ROI form for both patient self-requests and third-party releases. **Form-2** is an outdated 2011 version of the same form, still indexed on the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain — a housekeeping gap that could confuse patients. **Form-3** is an inbound records request form (authorizing Michigan Medicine to pull records from other providers), unrelated to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves dual purposes, but it does meaningfully differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Item 2 provides a dedicated "Myself" checkbox with delivery options tailored to patients (Patient Portal, electronic email web link, US Mail), while item 3 handles third-party recipients with its own delivery methods. This structural separation gives patients a clear path without needing to decode which sections apply to them. Additionally, the form prominently promotes the **MyUofMHealth Patient Portal** as a free, zero-cost delivery channel — a strong nudge toward the most convenient option. However, the form remains fundamentally an authorization rather than a dedicated patient access request, and the fee schedule and prepayment language do not clearly exempt patient self-requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search for Michigan Medicine's ROI form immediately returned direct links to the current PDF on `uofmhealth.org`. No site navigation was required. The download was unobstructed — no CAPTCHAs or bot blocking on the primary domain (though the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain had Cloudflare challenges). The one annoyance is the uninformative filename (`ROI_.pdf`).

## Form Document Quality

The form has a proper text layer and clean digital design — it is not a scan. However, despite the full text layer, **no fillable/interactive PDF fields exist** (metadata confirms `fillable_field_count: 0`). A patient must print and handwrite or use a PDF annotation tool. For submission, fax (734-936-8571) and mail are available; notably, **no walk-in services** are offered — a departure from the 2011 version which accepted in-person delivery at any registration desk.

The layout uses numbered sections (1–9) that follow a logical progression: voluntariness statement → patient info → self/third-party selection → purpose → record set → expiration → revocation → signature → fees. The **package-based record selection** system is a genuine bright spot: instead of requiring patients to specify individual record types, it offers pre-built packages (Package 1: Key Clinical Documentation; Package 2: All Clinical Documentation) mapped to common purposes. This simplifies what is typically one of the most confusing parts of any ROI form.

Language is bureaucratic but generally comprehensible. Legal disclosures (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure risks) are clearly stated. Some passages are dense, particularly the insurance authorization exception clause. The fee schedule on page 3 is presented as a clear table with a helpful "No Cost Services" sidebar.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are disclosed transparently: portal access is free, electronic delivery to patients costs $6.89, and third-party requests incur higher per-page fees. The $6.89 patient fee is close to HIPAA's cost-based guidance but not explicitly justified as cost-based. More concerning is the prepayment language — "Some records requested for legal, insurance, or personal use may require a prepayment" — where "personal use" could be read to include patient self-requests, potentially conflicting with HIPAA's prohibition on conditioning access on payment.

The authorization defaults to a 60-day expiration, which is relatively short given the stated turnaround of 5–7 business days (with a caveat to "allow up to 30 days"). Turnaround time discrepancies between pages 2 and 3 add confusion. The form also names **Vital Chart (VRC)** as the third-party vendor handling records fulfillment — a transparency bright spot that sets patient expectations for communications from an unfamiliar sender.

## Overall Assessment

Michigan Medicine provides a competent, moderately patient-centered records request process. The form is well-organized, the package system simplifies record selection, and the portal promotion guides patients toward a free pathway. However, the lack of fillable PDF fields, the ambiguous prepayment language, and the elimination of walk-in services create friction. The continued availability of the outdated 2011 form is a minor but avoidable risk. This is a solid B-level experience: functional and accessible, with room for improvement in digital form design and compliance clarity.

# Brattleboro Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, an independent nonprofit community hospital in Brattleboro, Vermont, publishes three ROI-related forms on its website. All three are general-purpose HIPAA disclosure authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to or from third parties. None is a dedicated patient access request form. The most current version — form-1.pdf, dated January 2025 — serves as the primary pathway for any patient requesting their own records, though patients must navigate a third-party-oriented workflow to do so.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three forms use a FROM/TO structure designed for transfers between parties. A patient requesting their own records would need to select the "Personal Records" purpose checkbox (available only on form-1 and form-3, not form-2) and enter their own name in the "TO" field — a workable but unintuitive approach. There is no online portal, patient portal integration, or web-based request wizard. The hospital's HIM Department lists a phone number (802-257-8258) and fax number (802-257-8881) on the form header, providing fax as an electronic submission channel, though the form itself never explicitly states how to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Standard web searches immediately returned direct PDF links hosted on the hospital's WordPress site. No login, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. However, the three overlapping forms are published without any landing page, version guidance, or indication of which is current. A patient who finds form-2 (older, shorter, with a witness line and 6-month default expiration) gets a materially different experience than one who finds form-1 (updated, more comprehensive, 12-month expiration, no witness line).

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1.pdf** (the best available) is a 2-page flat PDF. Despite retrieval notes suggesting fillable fields, metadata confirms zero interactive form fields — all blanks are underscore lines and text-rendered checkbox characters. Patients must print, handwrite, and submit via fax or physical delivery. The two-page structure is logical (instructions/rights on page 1, data entry on page 2), and required fields are marked with an asterisk convention. However, page 2 is densely packed with FROM/TO fields, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, verbal communication designees, date ranges, and signature blocks. Some checkbox labels are misaligned across columns. The language mixes plain statements with ALL CAPS instructions and bureaucratic phrasing — Instruction 4, which conditions processing on internal record completeness, is particularly confusing for patients.

The form offers approximately 15 fields for patient completion, a reasonable scope. Record-type checkboxes are comprehensive, covering standard categories plus sensitive information (psychiatric, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, hepatitis) and notably progressive categories (reproductive health care, gender affirming care). Delivery options are limited to "Pick Up" and "Send Out" with no electronic delivery mentioned.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on form-1 (though form-2 includes a witness line that may create perceived barriers). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "in accordance with state and federal law" — without specific amounts or a fee schedule. No response time commitment is stated. The form does not require in-person submission, and fax is available as an electronic submission pathway.

## Notable Strengths

- **Progressive sensitive-information categories**: The January 2025 revision includes Reproductive Health Care and Gender Affirming Care checkboxes — unusually inclusive for a community hospital.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to receive health services" directly addresses a common patient concern.
- **Verbal communication designees**: A dedicated section for authorizing up to three individuals for verbal communication with the hospital goes beyond typical ROI forms.
- **Easy online availability**: Forms are publicly accessible without any barriers to download.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: All forms funnel patients through a generic third-party disclosure workflow.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: The primary form cannot be completed digitally despite its digitally-authored appearance.
- **Multiple unversioned forms**: Three overlapping documents with no guidance creates confusion.
- **No electronic delivery options**: Only physical pickup or mail for receiving records.
- **No explicit submission instructions**: Fax and phone numbers are listed but the form never tells patients how to submit it.

## Overall Assessment

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The forms are easy to find and free of egregious barriers, and the January 2025 update shows thoughtfulness around sensitive health categories. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, non-fillable form format, and absence of electronic delivery options place the hospital behind peers who have modernized their records request processes. The overall experience earns a **C grade** — functional but not patient-centered.

# HopeHealth (Florence, SC) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

HopeHealth is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Florence, South Carolina. The organization has fully outsourced its medical records release process to HealthMark Group, a third-party vendor. No HopeHealth-branded ROI or authorization form exists as a publicly downloadable document. Instead, the organization's medical records page directs patients exclusively to HealthMark's online Request Manager portal.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved during the evaluation:

1. **form-1.pdf** — HopeHealth's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP). This is an informational document, not an authorization or request form. It mentions patients' right to access records but provides no actionable mechanism beyond directing them to the Privacy Officer's contact information.

2. **form-2.pdf** — A generic HealthMark Group Medical Records Release Authorization form. This was found on HealthMark's parent company website (hmutx.com), *not* on HopeHealth's website. It is unbranded and could apply to any HealthMark client facility.

The **primary pathway** for a patient is the HealthMark Request Manager online portal, linked from HopeHealth's medical records page at `https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/`. This portal requires email verification to initiate a request.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

HopeHealth does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The generic HealthMark form lists "Patient Request" as one of six purposes alongside Attorney, Insurance, Disability, and Referring Physician — treating patient access as a flavor of general disclosure rather than a distinct legal right under HIPAA § 164.524. The form cites § 164.508 (authorization for disclosure) throughout, which is the wrong legal framework for individual right-of-access requests. It is unknown whether the HealthMark portal differentiates these pathways internally, as the portal could not be accessed without email verification.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was **hard**. Extensive web searches, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine checks, and HTML source inspection failed to locate any HopeHealth-specific authorization form. Search results were complicated by name confusion with Hope Health Ellis County, TX (a different organization). The HealthMark portal is gated behind email verification, making it impossible to evaluate the actual request workflow or any forms within it. The Wayback Machine confirmed this portal-only approach has been consistent since at least 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The generic HealthMark form (form-2.pdf) is a digitally-created single-page PDF but has **no fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite or use annotation tools. It contains approximately 15 data fields and 11 record-type checkboxes. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (recipient → patient → dates → records → purpose → acknowledgments → signature), but the content is dense, with inline CFR citations and legal language that would challenge many patients. There are no instructions for completion, no statement of patient rights, and no options for how records should be delivered.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are not disclosed anywhere — neither on the form, the NPP, nor the medical records page. The generic form imposes a fixed 180-day expiration on the authorization, which would not apply to a § 164.524 access request. The NPP contains a notable typo: the Privacy Officer's email is listed as `HIPPA@hope-health.org` (misspelling HIPAA), which could undermine patient confidence and cause email delivery issues.

## Strengths

The decision to outsource to an online portal (HealthMark Group) is conceptually a strength — it provides a digital pathway that avoids requiring patients to download, print, and mail forms. The NPP, while dense, includes concrete patient-friendly examples of permitted uses and addresses substance use disorder protections. The generic form offers granular record-type selection with 11 categories.

## Overall Assessment

HopeHealth's approach is a mixed bag. The online portal represents a modern, potentially patient-friendly pathway, but the organization provides no transparency about what that portal experience entails. There is no downloadable form for patients who prefer a traditional approach, no fee disclosure, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The available documentation (NPP and generic form) has quality issues including dense legalese, wrong HIPAA citations, and a notable typo. A patient navigating this system would find their way to the portal with moderate effort but would encounter opacity about the process, fees, and timeline.

# Columbus Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbus Community Hospital is an independent nonprofit community hospital in Columbus, Nebraska. A single ROI form was found: a one-page "Authorization to Release Medical Records" (form MR-1, dated December 2014). The hospital does not offer a patient portal-based records request, an online request wizard, or any dedicated patient self-access form. The sole pathway is this generic third-party authorization form, with email submission available via `release@columbusch.com`.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

The most significant finding is that Columbus Community Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form is structured entirely as a release authorization: "I authorize Columbus Community Hospital to release the following information on [patient] to: [Name and Address]." A patient requesting their own records must write their own name and address in the "to:" field — an unintuitive workaround with no guidance that this is a valid or expected use of the form. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that patients have a right to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The hospital operates two domains: `columbusch.com` (the primary patient-facing site) and `columbushosp.org` (a legacy domain hosting the PDF). The patient forms page on the newer site mentions the Release of Information form and provides an email address for submission, but does not include a direct download link. A web search was needed to surface the PDF URL on the legacy domain. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during download.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks are represented as printed underscores requiring handwritten completion. Despite having a text layer (not a scan), the document offers no digital interaction — patients must print, handwrite, and then scan or photograph it to submit via email.

At one page, the form is concise. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, recipient identification, treatment dates, record type checkboxes (nine options plus "Complete Record"), purpose checkboxes (six options), sensitive-information authorization, patient acknowledgments, and signature blocks. However, the single-page density leaves little whitespace, and internal filing codes appear in the footer ("Found in Policy Manager/Consent Forms," "c: HIPAA Manual," page "42") — artifacts of internal document management that were never removed for patient-facing use.

Language is generally understandable but includes unexplained jargon ("H & P") and legalistic constructions in the acknowledgment section. The form includes no instructions or guidance text explaining how to complete it.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form avoids several common barriers: no fees are mentioned, no notarization is required, and no in-person submission is mandated. The revocation rights are clearly stated, and a built-in "Notice of Revocation" section allows patients to revoke authorization without finding a separate form — a genuine bright spot. The non-retaliation statement and 12-month authorization expiration are appropriate.

However, the witness signature line is ambiguous — it is unclear whether a witness is required or optional, which could deter patients completing the form at home. The form's age (dated 2014, over 11 years old at evaluation) raises questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Built-in revocation section; granular record-type selection (nine categories); email submission channel available; concise single-page format.

**Red flags:** No patient self-access pathway; form structured exclusively for third-party release; no mention of patient rights; non-fillable PDF requiring print and handwrite; internal filing codes visible on patient-facing document; disconnected web presence with form hosted on legacy domain without links from the main site.

## Overall Assessment

Columbus Community Hospital provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly patient-centered records request process. The form works — a determined patient can download it, fill it out by hand, and email it in — but the experience reflects a pre-digital, compliance-oriented approach rather than a patient-access-oriented one. The absence of any dedicated patient self-access pathway, combined with a non-fillable form from 2014 and a fragmented web presence, places this organization below average for patient-centeredness. **Grade: C**

# Minnie Hamilton Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Minnie Hamilton Health System (MHHS) is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Grantsville, West Virginia, affiliated with Mon Health. The organization does not publish any downloadable ROI or patient access form on its website. Instead, it directs all medical records requests through ChartRequest, a third-party online portal. Two documents were downloaded during this evaluation: a patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) and a Mon Health Medical Center authorization form (form-2.pdf) from the affiliate system — neither is an MHHS-branded records request form.

## Access Pathway

MHHS routes patients to ChartRequest (https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville) for medical records requests. This is an online portal where the authorization form is embedded in the electronic workflow. While portal-based submission is inherently electronic and potentially convenient, ChartRequest requires account creation before a patient can even see the authorization form or understand the terms of the request. This creates opacity — patients cannot preview the form, understand fee structures, or assess what information they'll need to provide before committing to a third-party account.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ChartRequest portal appears to be a general records release platform, not a pathway specifically designed for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. There is no publicly visible indication that MHHS has a separate, streamlined process for patients requesting their own records.

MHHS also maintains an Athena Health patient portal for clinical messaging, but the only downloaded document about it (form-1.pdf) covers sending documents *to* providers — the opposite direction of a records request. Whether a patient could request records through a portal message is unclear; the website directs records requests exclusively through ChartRequest.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding records request information for MHHS was **hard**. An extensive search process — multiple query variations, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine CDX API queries, and direct website navigation — failed to surface any downloadable ROI form. The MHHS website has no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. The website does link to ChartRequest from the patients page, but there is no standalone form to evaluate. The Mon Health authorization form (form-2.pdf) was located only by broadening the search to the affiliate system and is branded exclusively for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — a separate facility approximately 150 miles away.

## Form Document Quality

Because MHHS does not publish a standalone form, there is no primary form to assess for document quality in the traditional sense. The ChartRequest portal workflow could not be evaluated without creating an account. The Mon Health form (form-2.pdf), while not applicable to MHHS, provides the closest reference point: it is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) with dense content, a 4.1 MB file size (extremely bloated with 40 embedded images and 107 fonts), and no instructions for patients. It is a generic third-party authorization form that includes "Personal Use" as one purpose option but is not designed around patient self-access.

The patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) is well-written with numbered steps and plain language, suggesting MHHS is capable of producing clear patient-facing materials — but this capability was not applied to the records request process.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The primary barrier is **gatekeeping behind account creation**. Patients must create a ChartRequest account before they can access the authorization form or learn anything about the records request process. For patients with limited internet access or digital literacy — a real concern in rural Grantsville, WV — this is a significant obstacle. There is no phone-based or paper-based alternative publicly documented on the website, though the medical records department phone number (304-354-9700, ext. 2521) is listed.

No fee information is publicly available. No response time commitment is published. No patient rights information is accessible before engaging with the ChartRequest platform. The lack of any publicly visible authorization terms means patients cannot make informed decisions about the process before entering it.

## Strengths

- **Electronic submission pathway**: The ChartRequest portal provides a fully digital workflow, eliminating the need for printing, faxing, or mailing paper forms.
- **Digital-first approach**: MHHS has adopted modern platforms (Athena Health portal, ChartRequest) rather than relying solely on paper-based processes.
- **Clear instructional writing**: The patient portal guide demonstrates an ability to produce accessible, well-structured patient materials.

## Overall Assessment

Minnie Hamilton Health System presents a paradox: it has adopted a modern electronic records request platform, but in doing so has made the process less transparent and less accessible than many organizations that simply post a PDF form. The complete absence of a publicly available authorization form, fee schedule, timeline, or patient rights information means that MHHS patients enter the records request process with no visibility into what to expect. The reliance on a third-party platform with mandatory account creation creates an unnecessary gatekeeping barrier, particularly problematic for a rural critical access hospital serving a population that may have limited internet access. While the ChartRequest workflow may be well-designed internally, the opaque exterior facing patients undermines what could otherwise be a modern, patient-friendly approach.

# Blessing Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Blessing Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Quincy, Illinois, part of Blessing Health System. Five documents were retrieved — three superseded English versions (April 2023 and 2015), the current English authorization form (September 2025), and a current Spanish translation. The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf**, the September 2025 English "BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information," which is directly linked from the organization's Medical Records page alongside its Spanish counterpart (form-5.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Blessing Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary pathway is a **generic HIPAA authorization form** used for all releases of information — patient self-access, third-party disclosures, insurance, legal, and care transfers alike. The form uses bidirectional "RELEASE RECORDS FROM" / "RECORDS GOING TO" fields designed for inter-party transfers. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively authorizing the release of records from Blessing to themselves. The purpose options include "Personal reasons," which accommodates patient requests but does not distinguish them legally or procedurally from third-party authorization.

Notably, the retrieval notes indicate that Blessing Health also offers an **online records request tool** with identity verification via driver's license photo, mentioned on the Medical Records webpage. This provides a parallel digital pathway, though the PDF form remains the primary documented route.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Blessing Hospital authorization forms immediately returned direct PDF links, and the Medical Records page at blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords is well-organized under "For Patients > Request Medical Records." The one concern is version sprawl: three outdated English versions (from 2015 and April 2023) remain accessible at their original URLs with no deprecation notices or redirects. A patient arriving via a cached search result could unknowingly download a superseded form — including one that still requires a witness signature the organization has since eliminated.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4.pdf) is a **digitally authored, non-fillable 2-page PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks must be filled by hand after printing; circle instructions ("(Circle) Pick up or Mail or Fax or Email") reveal its print-first design. Despite this, the form is well-structured: patient demographics flow into records source/destination, then record type checkboxes (15 specific categories plus "Other"), sensitive information authorization, purpose, legal disclosures, and signatures. A dedicated page 2 provides **field-by-field completion guidelines** with plain-language examples — a genuine standout feature that most organizations omit.

The language is a mix: legal boilerplate on the authorization side is moderately dense, but the guidelines page compensates with concrete, accessible explanations. One persistent grammatical issue ("I authorize the use or disclosure of the above named individual's health information, its employees and agents, to furnish") creates ambiguity about who is authorizing what.

## Barriers and Compliance

The September 2025 revision made a significant improvement by **removing the witness signature requirement** that was present in the April 2023 versions — a barrier the organization itself recognized as unnecessary. No notarization is required. Photo identification "may be required," using permissive rather than mandatory language. The form does not disclose fees, though the website mentions a $6.50 flat fee for certain requests; HIPAA requires patients to be informed of fees before authorizing. The mandatory date range requirement ("MUST specify date range") could create friction for patients seeking comprehensive records. Submission can be made via mail or **fax** to three listed locations (Blessing Health System, Blessing Health Hannibal, and Denman Services), so patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

Blessing Hospital demonstrates several above-average practices: a **Spanish translation** linked alongside the English form, the detailed **completion guidelines** on page 2, **email as a delivery option**, active form improvement (witness requirement removal), and an **online records request tool** as an alternative pathway. The form is managed through PolicyStat, suggesting systematic version control.

## Overall Assessment

Blessing Hospital earns a **B** grade. The organization provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with helpful instructions and a Spanish translation — above average for a community hospital. However, the generic authorization design means patients requesting their own records must navigate a form not designed for them, and the non-fillable PDF format creates a paper-dependent workflow. The availability of an online records request tool and fax submission partially compensate for the print-and-fill form, but the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway and the absence of fee disclosure on the form itself are notable gaps.

# Fallon Medical Complex — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Fallon Medical Complex (FMC) is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Baker, Montana — a rural community in the state's eastern plains. FMC publishes three documents on its Information Management page: a primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a verbal release form (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The primary ROI form is the relevant document for a patient seeking copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

FMC does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form — "Authorization for Access, Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same "Release From" / "Release To" fields used when authorizing disclosure to an insurer or attorney. The form does list "Personal" as a purpose option, which is helpful, but provides no guidance on how a patient should fill in the directional fields when they are both the requester and the recipient. This is a common pattern among small facilities, but it means the patient must figure out which parts of the form apply to their situation.

The verbal release form (form-2) is narrowly scoped to phone-based verbal sharing and explicitly directs patients to form-1 for copies. The NPP (form-3) describes patient rights including the right to inspect and copy records but does not cross-reference the actual forms.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Two web searches led directly to the Information Management page at fallonmedical.org, where all three documents are clearly linked. No login walls, CAPTCHAs, or bot blocking were encountered. The one notable issue: the primary ROI form is published as a Microsoft Word .doc file rather than a PDF, hosted on a Google Cloud Storage bucket with "tmp" in the URL path — an unusual and potentially fragile hosting arrangement for a permanent compliance document.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page document with **zero fillable fields**. It was published as a .doc file and had to be converted to PDF for this study. The lack of fillable fields means every patient must print and handwrite their information. The form has a text layer (not a scan), uses 5 fonts, and is visually legible, but the non-interactive format is a significant accessibility gap — especially for a geographically isolated community where patients may live far from the facility.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → release routing → purpose → record types → date range → disclosure format → sensitive information → patient rights → signatures. The information-type checkboxes offer good granularity (10 categories from "Emergency Report/Records" to "Entire Medical Record"). The dual sensitive-information sections — one for categories to include, one to exclude — are structurally sound but confusingly similar, with identical checkbox labels distinguished only by a header word.

Language is a mix of accessible and legalistic. The "I Understand That" section covers core rights (revocation, non-conditioning, inspection under §164.524) but is dense. There are two spelling errors ("immunodefiency" twice, "proving" for "providing") and a confusing interstitial note ("IF SENDING RECORDS TO FMC, PLEASE MAIL IF MORE THAN 20 PAGES") apparently directed at other facilities rather than patients.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization is required (the witness signature is in the "For Office Use Only" section). Photo ID is required for fax, mail, or email submissions — reasonable identity verification, though potentially burdensome for patients without government-issued ID. The statement "A HIM professional will supervise the review of my medical record" adds friction to in-person review that may feel paternalistic.

**Notable bright spots for a rural CAH:**
- **First copy free** — the form explicitly states patients may receive the first copy without charge, reducing financial barriers.
- **Seven disclosure format options** — paper mail, USB drive/disc, electronic fax, review only, paper pick-up, unencrypted email (with informed consent), and patient portal access. This is remarkably comprehensive for a 25-bed rural hospital.
- **Patient portal integration** — offering portal signup directly from the ROI form bridges paper and digital workflows.
- **Unencrypted email with informed consent** — respects patient autonomy while ensuring awareness of risks.

Submission of the completed form appears possible via fax, mail, or email (implied by the ID requirement language), meaning patients do not need to physically visit the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fallon Medical Complex demonstrates a sincere effort to serve patients within the constraints of a small rural facility. The breadth of delivery format options is genuinely impressive and patient-centered. However, the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a patient access request, published in an outdated format (.doc) with no fillable fields. A patient must print, handwrite, and fax or mail the form — a workflow that falls short of modern accessibility expectations. For a critical access hospital in rural Montana, FMC does better than many peers, but meaningful improvements are within reach: converting to a fillable PDF, separating the patient access pathway, and adding clear instructions for self-access requests would significantly improve the experience.

# Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center (VGMHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Hillsboro, Oregon, serving a predominantly Latino patient population. The organization publishes four Release of Information–related documents on its website: the main HIPAA ROI authorization form in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), plus a Release of Verbal Health Information form in English (form-3) and Spanish (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records is form-1 (or form-2 for Spanish speakers).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

VGMHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. A patient wanting their own records must use the same general-purpose HIPAA Release of Information form designed for inter-provider exchanges and third-party releases. The form asks the patient to choose a direction ("Get information," "Give information," or "Get and give information") and specify a recipient provider/facility — a workflow that doesn't map cleanly to "I want a copy of my own records."

A partial mitigation exists: the form includes "For my own use" as a purpose checkbox alongside "Coordination of care" and "Insurance/Legal." This acknowledges patient self-access as a valid use case, but the patient still must navigate a form structured around bilateral information exchange rather than simple record retrieval. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal–based records request option visible on the website.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately returned direct links to the English ROI form, and the organization's Patient Forms page (https://virginiagarcia.org/get-care/patient-forms/) has a clearly labeled "Release of Information Forms" section grouping all four documents. The only friction points were technical: PDF links are embedded in Divi theme JavaScript click handlers rather than standard HTML anchor tags, and the initial Spanish PDF URL found via search returned an error page (the working URL differed by one character in the filename). Neither issue would meaningfully impede a typical patient clicking through the website.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English ROI form (form-1) is a **well-constructed, fillable interactive PDF** — a 2-page document with 54 interactive form fields, a full text layer, and clean digital typography. It was clearly born-digital, not a scan. The form follows a logical structure: patient identification → direction of release → recipient details → purpose and frequency → granular record type selection (9+ categories plus 4 sensitive-information opt-ins) → legal disclosures → signature block → staff-only section.

The language is mostly **plain and accessible**. The rights section clearly states patients don't need to sign to receive treatment, provides a 30-day processing timeline, and offers two concrete revocation pathways. One minor grammatical error exists ("If have not received your records" — missing "you").

A notable accessibility gap: all 54 fillable fields **lack accessible names** (`fillable_field_names: []`), meaning screen readers cannot identify what each field is for. This is a significant deficiency for an otherwise well-designed digital form.

## Barriers and Compliance

VGMHC imposes **no illegitimate barriers**. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, no witness signature needed, and no fees mentioned. The form header provides both a fax number (503-357-4371) and a PO Box address, enabling remote submission. The 30-day processing commitment aligns with HIPAA requirements.

One concern is the **open-ended authorization duration** — the form defaults to remaining in effect "until my care ends with Virginia Garcia," which could mean years or decades for a patient in an ongoing care relationship. While the patient can specify a different date, the default is unusually long compared to typical 1-year expirations.

The form does not explicitly cite the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or frame patient record requests as a distinct legal entitlement — it treats all authorization types equivalently under a general HIPAA authorization framework.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both the main ROI form and the verbal release form are available in full English and Spanish versions — not bilingual addenda, but complete standalone translations. For an FQHC serving a predominantly Spanish-speaking community, this is a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Granular record selection**: Patients can choose specific record types (progress notes with date range, immunizations, labs, dental, medications, imaging, consultations) rather than an all-or-nothing approach, with separate opt-ins for sensitive categories.
- **Active document governance**: Version numbering (v6), effective/revision dates, and department ownership (Compliance) demonstrate ongoing form maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Virginia Garcia earns a solid **B grade**. The organization makes its forms easy to find, provides a technically capable fillable PDF, offers meaningful bilingual access, and imposes no illegitimate barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway — a patient requesting their own records must navigate a generic authorization form designed for third-party releases. The form accommodates patient access (via the "For my own use" checkbox) but doesn't prioritize it. For an independent FQHC without portal infrastructure, this is a common pattern, and VGMHC handles it better than many peers thanks to its well-designed form documents and strong language accessibility.
