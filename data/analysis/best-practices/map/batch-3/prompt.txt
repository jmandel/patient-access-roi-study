# Proliance Surgeons — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Proliance Surgeons is a large, independent, for-profit physician practice group based in Seattle, WA, comprising multiple member practices (ProOrtho, Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, Northwest Physicians Specialists/MRI, Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons, and others). Four documents were retrieved: two nearly identical outgoing ROI authorization forms (form-2 from the main site, form-4 from ProOrtho), an image-only scan of a similar form (form-1 from NPS/MRI), and an incoming records transfer form (form-3 from Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons). The main medical records page also references Datavant as an online ROI partner, though the portal was not evaluated directly.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Proliance Surgeons does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. All outgoing ROI forms (form-1, form-2, form-4) use the same generic HIPAA authorization template ("Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information"), which is designed for third-party disclosure under § 164.508. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address as the "recipient" — an awkward workflow that conflates patient access rights (§ 164.524) with third-party authorization. The form does include an "at my request" reason checkbox, but the structure assumes disclosure to an external party. There is no mention of HIPAA Right of Access, no format/delivery preference field, and no reference to timelines or fee limitations specific to individual access.

The mention of Datavant on the medical records page suggests an online portal option exists, which would provide a more streamlined pathway, but the PDF forms themselves are the only downloadable option found.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A basic web search immediately surfaced multiple PDFs, and the main Proliance medical records page (proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links directly to the primary form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The main challenge is fragmentation: different member practices host their own versions of the same template, and a patient arriving at a subsidiary site (npsmri.com, proortho.com) may find a different version than the canonical one on the main site, with no cross-referencing between versions.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf** (ProOrtho), which is textually identical to form-2 but was noted to have interactive checkboxes (though metadata reports 0 AcroForm fields, suggesting non-standard implementation). Both are single-page, cleanly structured documents with two clear sections: "I. My Authorization" and "II. My Rights." The language is relatively plain, written in first person ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), and the layout is logical. Scope options are well-granulated (all records, condition-specific, date-specific, plus sensitive categories requiring explicit opt-in per Washington State law). However, neither form has true fillable text fields — patients must print and handwrite all entries. Form-2 includes a practice-specific fax number (425.820.8975) for submission; form-4 lacks any submission instructions entirely.

Form-1 is an image-only scan at 150 DPI with no text layer — completely inaccessible to screen readers and unsearchable. It represents the worst-case scenario a patient might encounter if they land on the NPS/MRI subsidiary site.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness requirement** — a positive.
- **No fees disclosed** — neutral; avoids deterrence but leaves patients uninformed.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax submission is available via form-2.
- **No electronic signature option** — requires printing and wet signature.
- **No response time stated** — patients have no expectation for turnaround.
- **Practice-specific contact info** baked into one form variant, creating confusion for patients at other Proliance locations.

## Notable Strengths

- **Concise one-page format** that covers all essential authorization elements without clutter.
- **Sensitive information categories** properly separated with individual opt-in checkboxes (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), compliant with Washington State RCW 70.02.
- **First-person rights language** in the "My Rights" section, which is more patient-friendly than typical third-person legal boilerplate.
- **Clear revocation instructions** with two specific methods (revocation form or letter).
- **Datavant portal mentioned** on the medical records page as an online alternative.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **Generic authorization form conflated with patient access** — no dedicated Right of Access pathway.
- **No fillable text fields** — print-and-handwrite workflow despite being a digitally-created document.
- **Fragmentation across subsidiaries** — multiple versions with inconsistent quality and no cross-referencing.
- **Form-1 is an image-only scan** — a digital accessibility failure.
- **Form-3 cites wrong state law** (California CMIA instead of Washington RCW 70.02) and wrong HIPAA year (2003 vs. 1996).

## Overall Assessment

Proliance Surgeons provides a readily findable, concise authorization form with reasonable content design and no major procedural barriers. However, the organization falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all record requests through a generic third-party authorization form with no differentiation for individual access. The print-and-handwrite workflow and subsidiary fragmentation further diminish the experience. The mention of Datavant as an online option is promising but not reflected in the downloadable forms themselves. Overall grade: **C** — adequate but not designed around patient self-access.

# Montefiore Nyack Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Montefiore Nyack Hospital (part of Montefiore Health System) publishes a single "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available in two versions. The current version (form-1.pdf, Rev. 01/2022) is a 3-page fillable PDF linked from the hospital's [Medical Records page](https://www.montefiorenyack.org/manage-my-care/medical-records). An older version (form-2.pdf, Rev. 10/2021) remains accessible at its original URL but is no longer linked from the website. Both forms are facility-branded rather than system-wide Montefiore Health System forms.

The hospital provides three submission channels: fax (845-348-8433), email (ROI@montefiorenyack.org), and phone (845-348-2527), with a physical mailing address also listed. Electronic delivery of records via email is explicitly offered — a notable positive.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Montefiore Nyack does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA release serving patients, attorneys, and "other individuals/companies" as parallel options under a single "RELEASE THE REQUESTED RECORDS TO" section. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or any framing that acknowledges patients have a legal right to their records. The transaction is characterized entirely as an "authorization to release" — a third-party authorization framework applied to patient self-access. A patient can select "PATIENT" as the recipient, but must navigate a form that equally serves attorneys and other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL, and the form is one click from the Medical Records page. The only friction was technical: the site's CDN/WAF blocks automated downloads (curl requests return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. This bot-blocking is likely unintentional but could affect patients using download managers or assistive tools.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a meaningful improvement over its predecessor. It includes 39 interactive fillable fields, allowing patients to complete it digitally rather than printing and handwriting. The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient designation → record type selection → sensitive information consent → legal disclosures → signature → contact information. Section headers are bold and labeled, and record type checkboxes (ER, inpatient, outpatient, images, billing) offer useful granularity.

However, several quality issues undercut the form. All 39 fillable fields lack accessible names, creating a significant screen-reader accessibility gap. The form has inflated to 3 pages and 353 KB (with 210 embedded images) compared to the older single-page version covering identical content in 70 KB. The revocation paragraph contains a grammatical error ("affect" instead of "effect") and switches between first and second person mid-sentence, suggesting poorly merged source text. Despite a header instructing patients to "SPECIFY THE DATES OF SERVICE," no field exists for entering dates. The distinction between an "abstract" and a full medical record is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to request the full record.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no witness signature, no in-person submission requirement. Fees are not mentioned at all — neither disclosed nor waived. Revocation rights and re-disclosure warnings are clearly stated. Sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug, mental health, HIV) are appropriately separated per New York State law. The electronic delivery option requires a somewhat confusing two-step process (provide email on the form and send a confirmation email to ROI@montefiorenyack.org), adding unnecessary friction.

## Overall Assessment

Montefiore Nyack Hospital provides a functional, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process. The fillable PDF, multiple submission channels, and electronic delivery option are genuine strengths that place it above many peers. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — funneling self-access requests through a generic third-party authorization form — is the most significant gap. The form's technical quality is further diminished by unnamed fillable fields, grammatical errors, and confusing instructions around dates of service and electronic delivery. The hospital earns a solid **B grade**: accessible and usable, but not designed around the patient self-access use case.

# TriStar Centennial Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

TriStar Centennial Medical Center is an HCA Healthcare–affiliated community hospital in Nashville, TN. Three documents were retrieved: the primary English-language HCA authorization form (form-1), a Spanish translation (form-3), and a separate form for Centennial Medical Group, an affiliated physician practice in Elkridge, MD (form-2). The hospital's own forms (form-1 and form-3) are the relevant documents for assessing this facility's patient access experience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for authorization/release form terms immediately surfaced the hospital's medical records page, which is clearly organized under For Patients → Medical Records. Both English and Spanish PDF download links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or portal login was required. The HCA Digital Asset Management URLs worked with a standard download. This is about as easy as form retrieval gets.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

TriStar Centennial does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary document (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of PHI" designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release. The "Purpose of disclosure" field lists "At the request of the individual" as the first option, with "Other 3rd party recipient" as the alternative — but both flow through the same form, same fields, and same process. Patients must navigate Section B (marketing/sale of PHI disclosures) even when it doesn't apply, and the form's recipient fields are oriented toward third-party recipients rather than a simple "send me my records" workflow.

That said, the medical records page also offers a **Swellbox online portal** for digital submission and the **MyHealthONE patient portal** for direct record access, providing alternative pathways that may offer a more patient-centric experience. The existence of these portal options partially compensates for the generic form design.

## Form Document Quality

The primary HCA form (form-1) is technically excellent. It is a **digitally native, single-page PDF with 52 fillable fields** — covering every input from patient demographics to 16+ record-type checkboxes to delivery preferences. This is unusually thorough; many organizations provide flat, non-fillable PDFs that require printing and handwriting. The file is lean (170 KB, no embedded images, 9 fonts), confirming it was designed as a digital artifact rather than scanned from paper.

The form offers **four delivery format options** — paper copy, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email — which is above average. It includes a forward-looking **USCDI Release Request** option for structured health data exchange, though this feature is aimed at provider-to-provider use and would confuse most patients.

Layout is organized into three labeled sections (A: core authorization, B: marketing/sale disclosures, C: signatures), which provides logical structure. However, packing this much content into a single page means tight spacing and modest font sizes. The language is a mix of functional form labels and legal disclosures — the patient rights statements use reasonably plain first-person language ("I understand that…"), but passages like the unencrypted email risk disclaimer are dense.

The **Spanish translation** (form-3) is a full parallel version with identical structure and 52 fillable fields — not a scan or afterthought. A few staff-facing elements (footer text, "ID verified by" field) remain in English, but the patient-facing content is fully translated.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no significant barriers**. No notarization or witness is required. The SSN field is explicitly marked optional. The 180-day default expiration is reasonable with options for custom dates. Psychotherapy notes are properly separated per HIPAA requirements. Fee language references a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts — appropriate, though it gives patients no cost visibility.

Submission options include **fax (844-481-0298) and mail**, plus the Swellbox portal for fully digital submission. A patient can complete and submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual fillable PDFs**: Both English and Spanish versions with 52 interactive fields each, directly linked from the same page
- **USCDI release option**: Rare acknowledgment of interoperability standards on an ROI form
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Four options including encrypted email
- **Portal alternatives**: Swellbox and MyHealthONE provide digital-first pathways beyond the PDF
- **10-day turnaround** (on the CMG form) and clear contact information

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: The generic authorization form doesn't distinguish individual access rights from third-party release
- **Default to paper delivery**: If the delivery section is left blank, the patient gets paper — an electronic default would be more patient-friendly
- **Dense single page**: The amount of content compressed onto one page may challenge patients with limited literacy or visual impairments
- **Minor grammatical error**: "I may see and obtain a copy the information" is missing "of"

## Overall Assessment

TriStar Centennial earns a **B grade**. The technical quality of its forms is strong — fillable fields, bilingual availability, multiple delivery options, and a clean digital PDF. Retrieval is effortless. Compliance posture is solid with no unnecessary barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway: a patient requesting their own records navigates the same authorization form as an insurer or attorney, with no differentiation in process, language, or workflow. The availability of portal alternatives (Swellbox, MyHealthONE) partially mitigates this, but the core PDF experience doesn't center the patient as an individual exercising their right of access.

# Wayne County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Monticello, Kentucky. The facility provides a single one-page form for patients requesting their own medical records, along with a parallel web-based HTML form that captures equivalent information online. For a small rural hospital, the availability of dual pathways — PDF and online — is notably progressive.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Only one downloadable PDF was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." This is a patient-access-oriented form, not a generic third-party authorization. The title and structure center on patient self-access, with "self" listed first among record-ownership options (self, child, other). The hospital also offers a web-based HTML form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` that collects equivalent information and allows electronic submission — a genuinely useful alternative to the print-and-deliver workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Wayne County Hospital does a better-than-average job distinguishing patient self-access from third-party release. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" rather than "Authorization for Release of Information," and the patient is addressed directly as the expected user. However, the same single form is used for all requesters — self, child, or other — with no separate instructions or additional authorization requirements for third-party requests. There is no dedicated third-party release form, which means the form functions as a blended instrument, though its default orientation is clearly toward patient access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted web search. The form lives at `/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf` — a media library path that is not linked from any navigable page on the hospital website. The HIM department page provides a phone number but no form download link. There is no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. A patient browsing the website would likely not discover the PDF without calling HIM or using a search engine. The web-based form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` may be more discoverable through site navigation, though this was not confirmed. Retrieval difficulty is moderate — not hard, but requiring search engine assistance rather than intuitive site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable single page. It has a text layer (not a scan) and uses only three fonts, but all fields are represented as underscore blanks — a print-and-handwrite design. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → request type and delivery method → record ownership → dates of service → specific records requested (10 checkboxes) → reason for request → identification presented → signatures. The language is plain and accessible with no legalese. One page is an appropriate length for this type of request.

Delivery options are strong: fax, email, mail, and pick-up. Email as a delivery option is uncommon at critical access hospitals and reduces barriers for rural patients who may live far from the facility.

## Barriers & Compliance Concerns

**Witness requirement:** The form includes a separate "Witness" signature line. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access requests, and this creates a meaningful barrier — a patient filling out the form at home must find a witness before submitting. This is particularly burdensome for rural and isolated patients.

**Reason for request:** The form asks patients to check a reason (Continuity of Care, Personal Interest, Insurance Claims Processing, Legal Claims Processing, Other) without indicating this is optional. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not justify their request.

**Submission method not specified on PDF:** The form itself does not state where or how to return it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is printed on the document. However, the existence of the web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` provides a clear electronic submission pathway.

**Fee transparency:** The form prominently states "Based on KRS 422.317 a first copy of a patient's record will be provided free, subsequent copies may be charged." This Kentucky-law-based disclosure of free first copies is unusually transparent for a facility of this size.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dual pathway (PDF + web form):** Offering both a downloadable PDF and an online web form is exceptional for a 25-bed critical access hospital.
- **Free-copy disclosure on the form itself:** Citing KRS 422.317 about free first copies directly on the form is a bright spot few larger organizations match.
- **Email delivery option:** Including email alongside fax, mail, and pick-up is forward-thinking.
- **One-page brevity:** No unnecessary legal boilerplate — approachable and quick to complete.

## Overall Assessment

Wayne County Hospital demonstrates a patient-centered approach that exceeds expectations for its size and setting. The form is clearly designed for patient self-access, the language is plain, and the availability of an online web form and email delivery are genuine differentiators. The main weaknesses are the witness signature requirement (a real barrier with no legal basis for patient access requests), the unfindability of the PDF on the website, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF. Despite these issues, the overall pathway is solid — a patient can submit their request electronically via the web form, receive records by email, and pay nothing for a first copy.

# Arizona Community Physicians — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Arizona Community Physicians (ACP) is an independent, for-profit physician practice group in Tucson, Arizona. The organization maintains a well-organized patient forms page at azacp.com/forms/ with seven downloadable PDFs covering general records release, practice-specific release, imaging-specific release, adult/minor access designation, a Spanish minor access form, and a HIPAA amendment request. Critically, ACP also offers an online electronic records self-request wizard through Swellbox (swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html), providing a modern digital pathway alongside the paper forms.

## Relevant Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1.pdf** — the general "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (Form 100, revised 08/26/2024). However, ACP also provides the **Swellbox online wizard**, which is the superior pathway for a patient who wants to submit a request electronically without printing, hand-filling, and physically delivering a paper form. The forms page links to both options, giving patients a choice.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

ACP does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release, with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields that frame the transaction as a provider-to-provider or provider-to-entity transfer. The "TO" field is labeled "Name of Physician/Organization," implying the recipient should be another provider rather than the patient. A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name and address in that field, but the form provides no guidance for this use case. The purpose checkboxes include "At request of Patient," which at least acknowledges patient-initiated requests, but the form structure does not differentiate the legal framework (HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524 vs. authorization under § 164.508).

The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, may offer a more patient-centric experience as an electronic self-request tool, though its exact workflow was not evaluated as a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding ACP's forms was **easy**. The Patient Forms page is linked from the main website navigation, and multiple search strategies (web search, site-specific search, direct navigation) all returned direct PDF URLs. No login, bot blocking, or browser fallback was needed. The forms page is clearly organized and lists all seven documents. The Swellbox wizard link is also present on the forms page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF** with a native text layer. Despite being revised in August 2024, it has zero fillable fields — all blanks are underscore placeholders requiring printing and handwriting. The layout is clean and logically organized with capitalized section headers (PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM/TO, PURPOSE, TYPE OF INFORMATION). The language is generally plain and accessible, though the fee disclosure is confusingly placed as a footnote under the "Other" purpose checkbox rather than in its own section. The form collects a reasonable set of fields (~12-15 blanks) without requesting a Social Security Number — a positive privacy practice. It includes a "Former Name" field, which is a thoughtful inclusion.

The form offers three delivery format options (paper, disc/PDF, email), though email is restricted to "medical records processed by CIOX" without explaining what that means. The two-tier record type structure appropriately separates general records from protected records (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse) with distinct consent checkboxes.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness requirements.** Fees are disclosed at $0.07/page and $6.50/disc — both modest and within HIPAA limits — though "additional charges for shipping and handling" are mentioned without quantification. The one-year authorization expiration is standard. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated.

The most significant barrier is the **absence of submission instructions** on form-1 itself — no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal URL. A patient who downloads and prints the form has no idea where to send it. This is a functional defect. By contrast, form-7 (amendment request) includes explicit mail, fax, and in-person delivery instructions. The Swellbox wizard partially mitigates this by offering an entirely separate electronic pathway, but form-1 doesn't reference it.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox electronic self-request wizard** provides a modern digital alternative to the paper form ecosystem
- **Comprehensive form suite** — seven distinct documents covering diverse patient needs, including imaging-specific and amendment request forms
- **Spanish-language minor access form** (form-6) demonstrates language access awareness appropriate for Tucson's ~42% Hispanic population
- **No SSN collection** on the primary ROI form
- **Protected records separation** with distinct checkboxes for HIV, behavioral health, and substance abuse
- **HIPAA amendment request form** published online — uncommon among practices

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient self-access form** — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization
- **No fillable fields on any form** — all seven PDFs are flat, print-and-fill documents
- **No Spanish version of the primary ROI form** (form-1), despite Spanish availability for the minor access form
- **Missing submission instructions** on the primary ROI form
- **Fee disclosure placement** is confusing (buried under "Other" purpose checkbox)
- **1-year default records limitation** may surprise patients seeking complete history

## Overall Assessment

ACP demonstrates above-average organizational effort in making patient forms accessible online, with a well-organized forms page, a comprehensive suite of documents, and — crucially — a Swellbox electronic self-request option that elevates the patient experience beyond the paper-form baseline. However, the primary ROI form itself is a generic third-party authorization that doesn't distinguish patient self-access, lacks fillable fields, and omits submission instructions. The availability of the Swellbox pathway is the key differentiator that lifts ACP's overall assessment, though the paper form ecosystem could benefit from modernization and better patient-access-specific design.

# Springhill Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms & Pathways

Springhill Medical Center provides two downloadable documents from its Medical Records page: a single-page "Request for Release of Health Information" authorization form (form-1.pdf) and a generic ONC patient rights infographic (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is an actionable authorization form. The organization's Medical Records page also links to a **Zoho-based online ROI request portal** operated by MedRecs Management, and mentions a patient portal. The HIM department accepts fax submissions at 251.410.4014.

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

Springhill does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole authorization form uses a generic structure — "I hereby authorize ___ to release the following information to ___" — designed for third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in the hospital as the source and themselves as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that individual access requests have different legal requirements than third-party authorizations. The Zoho portal may offer a more tailored digital workflow, but the downloadable form funnels all requesters through a single generic pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A simple web search returned the PDF directly, and the organization's Medical Records page clearly links to both the form and the Zoho portal. No bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. However, the form URL embeds "2011-Version-1" in the filename, raising immediate questions about currency.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** — no interactive fields, no clickable checkboxes, just underscore blanks and bracket-style checkboxes requiring print-and-handwrite completion. At one page, the length is reasonable, and the logical flow (demographics → authorization → record types → delivery method → legal language → signature) is sound. However, the form is visually dated and dense, cramming all content onto a single page with small text. The language is a mix of functional and legal — mostly accessible but with a dense legal block at the bottom covering revocability, sensitive information categories, and redisclosure warnings.

The form requests approximately 20–25 fields including patient demographics, record type selections, delivery method details, and signatures. Notably, it asks for the patient's **Social Security Number**, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates a significant privacy risk.

## Barriers & Concerns

Several barriers stand out:

- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers for a medical records request creates unnecessary privacy risk, especially for forms submitted via fax or email.
- **Witness signature line**: The form includes a "Signature of Witness" field, implying a witness may be required — an unnecessary barrier with no HIPAA basis for patient-initiated requests.
- **Sensitive information bundling**: Substance abuse, psychiatric, STD, and HIV/AIDS records are bundled into the general authorization without separate opt-in, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2.
- **Outdated references**: The form still uses the legacy name "Springhill Memorial Hospital" and references "UB-92" (replaced by UB-04 in 2007), signaling a form that has not been updated in over a decade.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods**: The 2011-era form offers five delivery options — pick-up, mail, fax, patient portal, and email — which was forward-looking for its time.
- **Online portal availability**: The Zoho-based electronic request portal provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.
- **Patient rights education**: Hosting the ONC patient rights infographic shows awareness of patient access rights, even if the resource is generic.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: The form explicitly states that treatment and payment cannot be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Springhill Medical Center provides a functional but dated pathway for records access. The form is easy to find and offers multiple submission methods including fax and email, but the authorization form itself is a 15-year-old, non-fillable generic release form that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party disclosure. The SSN requirement and witness signature line create unnecessary barriers. The existence of a Zoho-based online portal is a meaningful positive, offering patients a digital alternative — though the downloadable form itself reflects a process that has not been meaningfully updated since 2011. A patient can get their records through this organization, but the experience requires navigating a form not designed for them.

# SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison, a community hospital in Wisconsin's capital and part of the SSM Health system, provides three overlapping PDF authorization forms for medical records requests. None of the three forms are specifically designed for patient self-access; all are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" forms that a patient must adapt for their own use. The most relevant form for a patient at this facility is form-3, a location-specific version pre-filled with the Madison PO Box address and fax numbers for Dean Medical Group and SSM Health Hospitals.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found online:

1. **Form-1** (AH-FRM-11595, revised 8/2024): A Wisconsin-wide SSM Health authorization form covering all Wisconsin ministries. Two pages. Most recently updated but not facility-specific.
2. **Form-2** (DPM-2065-035, dated 1/2019): A system-wide SSMHC "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure" form. One page. The only form whose title explicitly includes "Request for Access to" and offers patient access as a named purpose with sub-options (Copy, Inspection, Summary). However, it is outdated (7+ years old), uses the former "SSMHC" branding, and lacks submission instructions entirely.
3. **Form-3** (A9008836, dated 5/2019): A Madison-area-specific authorization form listing St. Mary's Hospital – Madison and five neighboring SSM Health facilities. Two pages. Pre-filled with the Madison PO Box and fax numbers, making it the most actionable form for this facility.

The primary submission pathways are fax (608-294-6294 for Dean Medical Group, 608-270-6815 for SSM Health Hospitals) and postal mail (PO Box 259840, Madison, WI 53725-9840). Phone numbers are provided for inquiries. No online submission portal exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway at this facility. All three forms are structured as general HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. The best patient-access accommodation is found in form-3's "Personal Use" checkbox (Section 4) and the instruction "(If Release is to Self, State Self)" in Section 3. Form-2 goes further with explicit "For personal access" options and "Type of access requested" (Inspection / Hard Copy / Electronic Copy), but it is outdated and lacks facility-specific submission details. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, selecting the correct options to indicate self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was rated **easy**. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without bot blocking or JavaScript barriers. The SSM Health website has a "Get My Medical Records" page, and the location-specific form (form-3) has a well-structured URL path (`.../patients-and-visitors/get-medical-records/wisconsin/st-marys-madison-medical-records-request-form.pdf`). However, the existence of three overlapping forms — with different dates, scopes, and content — creates potential confusion. No guidance is provided about which form to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the most facility-relevant document, is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores and all checkboxes appear as "q" characters, indicating a print-oriented design. A patient must print the form, complete it by hand, and fax or mail it. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence (patient info → recipient → purpose → records scope → format → expiration → signature), and the back page provides thorough patient rights information in an organized bullet-point format. Language is formal but not excessively legalistic. Section 6 offers notably strong delivery format options: MyChart, DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, Fax, and Email — the inclusion of MyChart portal delivery is a genuine bright spot.

Estimated field count for a self-access request is approximately 15 fields (patient demographics, "self" as recipient, purpose selection, record type checkboxes, date range, format, expiration, and signature), which is reasonable.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees for "viewing"**: The back page states SSM Health "may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records." HIPAA does not permit charging patients for inspecting their own records, making the "viewing" language a compliance concern.
- **No 30-day timeline commitment** on form-3 (only form-2 mentions a 30-day response time).
- **Sensitive categories default to inclusion**: Section 5a defaults to disclosing mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and developmental disability records unless the patient explicitly excludes them — a design choice that could lead to unintended disclosure.
- **Outdated forms**: Form-3 dates to 2019, while form-1 was revised in 2024, raising questions about whether form-3 is still current.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart delivery option**: Offering patient portal delivery on the authorization form is uncommon and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **Multiple electronic delivery formats**: Email and fax are also available as delivery options.
- **Comprehensive patient rights information**: The back page covers right to refuse, inspect, copy, revoke, and includes detailed Wisconsin-specific minor consent rules.
- **Photocopy validity clause**: "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" removes a friction point.

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital – Madison earns a **C grade**. The organization makes forms easy to find and provides reasonable delivery format options including MyChart. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the complete absence of fillable form fields, the "viewing" fee language that may overreach HIPAA limits, and the use of a generic third-party authorization form for patient self-access all reflect a process that was not designed with the patient requester in mind. The form is usable but not patient-centered.

# The Baton Rouge Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

The Baton Rouge Clinic maintains three distinct medical records forms on a well-organized "Downloadable Forms" page: (1) an outbound release authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information FROM The Baton Rouge Clinic"), (2) an inbound transfer authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information TO The Baton Rouge Clinic"), and (3) a "Right of Access Form" citing HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 164.524. This three-form strategy shows unusual thoughtfulness — the clinic has differentiated between outbound third-party release, inbound records transfer, and patient-directed access, which is more than most organizations offer.

## Patient Self-Access Pathway

The Right of Access form (form-3) is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. At just one page and ~1,300 characters, it is admirably concise compared to the two-page authorization forms. It explicitly cites HIPAA Right of Access authority and offers a choice between electronic and hard copy delivery — a genuine bright spot that many organizations lack.

However, the form has a meaningful design flaw: it is framed entirely as a designee authorization, directing providers to disclose records "to: Name: ___." There is no clear option for a patient to request records for themselves; a patient wanting their own records would need to awkwardly write their own name in the recipient field. The form that most directly invokes the Right of Access isn't actually designed for the most common Right of Access use case — patient self-request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search immediately returned direct PDF links to the authorization forms. All three forms were hosted on a well-organized downloadable forms page at `batonrougeclinic.com/patient-information/downloadable-forms/` with no login, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering required. The one findability gap: the Right of Access form (form-3) was not surfaced by the initial web search and was only discovered by browsing the forms page directly. A patient searching specifically for "how to request my records" might land on the third-party release form instead.

## Form Document Quality

All three forms are flat PDFs with zero fillable fields, despite having clean text layers (not scans). Every form requires printing and hand-filling — a significant accessibility gap, particularly ironic for form-3, which explicitly offers electronic record delivery while requiring a paper submission process. Form-3 has a clean, simple layout with logical flow (patient name → designee → scope → format → duration → signature). The language is relatively plain and accessible. Form-1 uses an asterisk system to mark required fields, which is helpful, though it also requires a Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection burden that form-3 wisely avoids.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. None of the forms disclose fees or state response times. Form-1 includes a hold-harmless clause that goes beyond HIPAA requirements, though form-3 omits this — a more patient-friendly approach. Submission methods are poorly documented: form-1 provides a medical records email (medrecords@brclinic.com) and phone number for questions and urgent requests, but no form explicitly states how to submit the completed document. No fax number is provided. The mailing address appears in footers. A patient completing form-3 has no guidance on where or how to send it.

## Overall Assessment

The Baton Rouge Clinic demonstrates above-average organizational thinking about patient access — the three-form strategy and HIPAA Right of Access citation reflect genuine awareness of different use cases. The Right of Access form's conciseness and electronic delivery option are bright spots. However, the execution falls short in key areas: all forms lack fillable fields, submission pathways are unclear, and the Right of Access form's designee-only framing creates a confusing gap for patients seeking their own records. The clinic has the right structure but needs better implementation — fillable fields, explicit submission instructions, and a self-access option on the Right of Access form would substantially improve the patient experience.

# OrthoCarolina — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

OrthoCarolina, an independent for-profit orthopedic practice in Charlotte, NC, offers a single generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests — whether the patient is requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party. Three versions of this form (dated 2017, 2020, and 2023) remain simultaneously available at different URLs on the organization's website. The most current version (form-1, revised 04/2023) is the primary form linked from the medical records resource page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

OrthoCarolina does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All requests flow through the same "Authorization for Access/Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under Purpose of Release, which at least signals that patient self-requests are a recognized use case. However, the mandatory recipient section ("This information is to be disclosed to the following individual or entity (MUST BE COMPLETED)") forces patients requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as the disclosure target — a design that treats self-access as just another flavor of third-party release rather than a distinct right under HIPAA § 164.524.

The form makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access, does not explain patient rights to receive records within 30 days, and does not distinguish the fee structure for patient access (which must be reasonable and cost-based) from third-party release fees.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned both the direct PDF link and OrthoCarolina's medical records resource page. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or browser fallback was needed — forms downloaded cleanly via direct URL. The main findability concern is version confusion: three nearly identical forms exist at three different public URLs with no version indicators in the filenames, no redirects from old URLs, and different fax numbers across versions (the 2017 form lists a different fax number). A patient who finds form-2 via a search engine could submit to the wrong fax number.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised as recently as April 2023, it uses underscored blank lines throughout, requiring patients to print and handwrite. A patient determined to complete it digitally would need third-party PDF annotation tools — a workaround, not a designed workflow.

The layout is dense but follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → records requested → radiology images → recipient → purpose → fee notice → delivery method → sensitive information consent → signature. However, the single-page constraint leads to cramped formatting, and the delivery method section has a known layout defect where authorization expiration language overlaps with delivery checkboxes, producing garbled text in the PDF's text layer (problematic for screen readers).

The language is mostly plain, though the sensitive-information consent and revocation clauses run together in a single dense paragraph. The newer form-1 dropped the prominent "YOU MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION" notice that appeared in both older versions — a regression in patient-rights transparency.

## Submission & Delivery

OrthoCarolina offers notably comprehensive submission and delivery options. The form can be submitted via mail, email (OrthoCarolinaMedRec@orthocarolina.com), fax, or patient portal upload. For record delivery, seven options are available: patient portal upload, email (for both records and radiology images), fax, paper mail, CD mail, and in-person pickup. This breadth — particularly the inclusion of email submission and patient portal delivery — is a genuine strength for a physician practice.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness is required. In-person delivery is not mandated. Fees are mentioned but not quantified: "Medical record copy fees are determined by both the nature/purpose of your request and the format/method of delivery." This vagueness, combined with no distinction between patient-access and third-party-release fee structures, creates a risk of overcharging for Right of Access requests. The form also includes a broad liability waiver releasing OrthoCarolina from "any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure" — standard boilerplate but potentially intimidating.

## Overall Assessment

OrthoCarolina earns credit for easy form findability, multiple submission/delivery channels (including email and portal), and a reasonably organized single-page form. However, the lack of any dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields in a 2023-vintage PDF, vague fee language, and the liability waiver embedded in a records request form collectively pull the assessment down. The organization treats patient self-access as undifferentiated from third-party release, missing an opportunity to acknowledge and streamline the exercise of a fundamental HIPAA right. The result is a serviceable but uninspired experience that a patient can navigate — but that was not designed with them in mind.

# Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital is part of Samaritan Health Services (SHS), a nonprofit regional health system in Oregon's Willamette Valley. All records request forms and processes operate at the system level — there are no facility-specific forms for the Lebanon campus. Five documents were retrieved: a standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information in English (form-4) and Spanish (form-5), a specialized Computer Readable EHI Export Request in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3).

## Pathways Available

SHS offers three distinct pathways for patients requesting their own records:

1. **MRO Express Online Portal** — The primary pathway the website directs patients toward. This is an outsourced third-party portal (MRO Corp.) for submitting records requests online. No downloadable PDF is produced; the request is web-based.

2. **Standard Authorization Form (form-4/form-5)** — A general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" PDF covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Submittable by mail, fax, or email. Available in English and Spanish.

3. **EHI Computer Readable Export Form (form-1/form-2)** — A specialized form for requesting health information in machine-readable format. Also available in English and Spanish. This is a notably rare offering.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The standard form (form-4) is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it handles the distinction reasonably well: Section 3 includes a "Personal" checkbox for purpose, and Section 7 splits into "released to myself" (with multiple delivery options) versus "OR release my records to" a third party. This is a combined form, not a dedicated patient access pathway, but the dual structure is functional and the patient self-access route is clearly accommodated.

The EHI export form (form-1) is genuinely patient-centric — its purpose field comes pre-checked as "Patient Request - Electronic" and the entire form is designed around patient self-access. However, this serves only the niche use case of computer-readable data export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the downloadable forms was **difficult**. The medical records request page primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal. The PDF form download links are hidden inside a collapsed accordion section titled "Sending a Request by Mail or Fax" that required browser DevTools (JavaScript link extraction) to discover. Web searches returned confusable results from unrelated organizations with similar names. A patient who prefers a traditional form rather than the online portal would struggle to find the PDF.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-4) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean text and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete it by hand despite the form being digital in origin. The form uses numbered sections (1–9) with clear headers and a matching instruction page. The language mixes functional plain language with legal boilerplate; the rights section is dense but the instructions on page 2 are more accessible. Record type granularity is strong, with 11 specific checkboxes plus an "Other" field.

Format and delivery options are a genuine bright spot: patients can choose from MyChart, email, paper, CD, fax, or write in an alternative. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery, which is uncommon among ROI forms.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees**: The fee disclosure is exemplary. Form-4 explicitly states "Initial Patient Request: No Charge" and "Continuing Care: No Charge," with fees only for third-party requests. However, the EHI export form (form-1) lacks this "no charge" language, stating only that "reasonable cost-based fees apply" — an inconsistency that could deter patients seeking computer-readable data.

**Processing time**: Stated as "up to 30 days," within HIPAA's permitted window.

**No notarization** required. No in-person-only submission requirement — mail, fax, and email are all accepted.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by mail, fax (541-768-9363), or email (SHSHIMROI@samhealth.org). The email option is notable — it allows fully electronic submission even without the MRO portal, though the non-fillable PDF creates an awkward print-fill-scan-email workflow.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: All forms (standard ROI and EHI export) are available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Dedicated EHI export form**: Offering a separate form specifically for computer-readable health information export is exceptionally rare and demonstrates genuine Cures Act awareness.
- **Fee transparency**: The three-tier fee structure with "No Charge" for patient requests is clear and patient-friendly.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Six format options including two electronic channels (MyChart and email).
- **Email submission channel**: Accepting form submission via email lowers barriers significantly.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDFs**: All forms have zero interactive fields despite being digitally authored — a clear missed opportunity.
- **Hidden download links**: The downloadable forms are buried in collapsed accordion sections, requiring technical effort to discover.
- **No dedicated patient access form**: The standard form serves both patient self-access and third-party release, requiring patients to navigate which sections apply.
- **EHI export fee ambiguity**: The EHI form does not match the standard form's "no charge" commitment for patient requests.

## Overall Assessment

Samaritan Health Services provides a solid, above-average experience for patients requesting their own records. The combination of an online portal as the primary pathway, a well-structured authorization form with multiple delivery options, bilingual availability, transparent fee disclosures, and a rare dedicated EHI export form puts this organization ahead of most peers. The main gaps are the non-fillable PDF forms and the poor discoverability of the downloadable form option. The organization clearly takes patient access seriously, even if the form design hasn't been fully modernized for digital-first completion.

# Cuba Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cuba Memorial Hospital is a small, independent critical access hospital in Cuba, NY, affiliated with the Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) alongside Olean General Hospital (OGH) and Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC). The hospital does not publish its own medical records request form. Instead, patients must discover and use ROI forms from affiliated UAHS facilities, found on a separate organization's website.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two forms were retrieved, both from the BRMC-OGH website (brmc-ogh.org), not from Cuba Memorial's own site:

- **Form 1 (OGH)**: "Authorization for Patient Access and/or Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," branded for Olean General Hospital. This is the most relevant form since both OGH and Cuba Memorial are New York facilities within UAHS.
- **Form 2 (BRMC)**: Nearly identical form branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Less relevant due to cross-state jurisdiction, but its blank disclosing-organization field makes it theoretically more adaptable.

The hospital's website also mentions a "YourHEALTH" patient portal for electronic record access, but no ROI form or formal request process is linked from the portal page.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are dual-purpose: their title explicitly covers both "Patient Access" and "Use and Disclosure." Section 4 includes dedicated checkboxes for patient inspection or copies, alongside a third-party release authorization line. This is a modest positive — the form acknowledges patient self-access as a use case rather than treating it as an afterthought. However, the form is fundamentally a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all release purposes, not a dedicated patient access form. A Cuba Memorial patient must also contend with the fact that neither form mentions their hospital by name, creating real confusion about which form to use and where to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was moderately difficult. Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website has no medical records page, no patient forms section, and no downloadable ROI form. Multiple search strategies — including site-specific searches, direct navigation, and sitemap review — yielded nothing. The forms were only discovered by following a small footer link from Cuba Memorial's site to the BRMC-OGH website, then navigating to the medical records page. A patient would need to recognize this footer link as relevant, navigate a different organization's site, and infer that the "OGH" form applies to their Cuba Memorial records — a non-obvious multi-step process.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are 2-page, digitally produced PDFs with text layers — not scans. However, neither has fillable fields (fillable_field_count: 0). Patients must print and complete them by hand. The forms use a numbered seven-section structure (authorization statement, disclosing organization, record types, recipient/patient access, patient rights, expiration, specially protected information) that provides reasonable organization. Approximately 15 fields require completion for a patient self-access request.

The language is moderately legalistic but generally comprehensible. Patient rights statements in Section 5 cover voluntariness, no treatment impact, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, and right to copies. However, a typo in Section 5(c) — "but in do" instead of "but if I do" — has persisted across both forms since at least 2017, suggesting the templates are unmaintained.

## Barriers

- **No clear submission pathway**: The forms provide no instructions for how to submit them. The bolded statement "Photo ID is required for records to be picked up" implies in-person pickup as the expected or only delivery method. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or online submission option is mentioned on the form or the BRMC-OGH medical records page.
- **Witness lines**: Dedicated witness signature lines appear without indication of whether witnessing is required or optional, potentially deterring patients from submitting unwitnessed forms.
- **90-day expiration**: Authorization expires after 90 days, which is unnecessary for patient access requests under HIPAA's ongoing right of access.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) mentions "a reasonable copy fee" with no specifics or fee schedule reference.
- **Outdated forms**: Both forms were last revised in January 2017, predating Information Blocking rules and 21st Century Cures Act implementation.

## Strengths

- The form explicitly contemplates patient self-access with dedicated inspection/copies checkboxes — relatively uncommon among generic authorization forms.
- Granular record type selection (11 categories with date ranges) gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.
- Appropriate handling of specially protected information (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) with separate consent checkboxes consistent with New York law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Overall Assessment

Cuba Memorial Hospital presents significant access challenges for patients seeking their own records online. The hospital publishes no form of its own, requiring patients to navigate to an affiliated organization's website and use a form branded for a different hospital. The forms themselves, while structurally adequate and notably inclusive of patient self-access checkboxes, are non-fillable, outdated, and provide no guidance on submission or delivery methods. The implied requirement for in-person pickup with photo ID — potentially at a facility 30+ miles away — represents a meaningful barrier for a rural critical access hospital population. The overall experience falls short of patient-centered design, earning a grade of C.

# Columbia Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbia Memorial Hospital (CMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Astoria, Oregon. Two ROI forms were found: an English-language "Release of Information" form (HIPAA Form 3B, revised February 2025) and a Spanish translation (HIPAA Form 3Bsp, revised August 2017). Both are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms — the hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access request form distinct from third-party release authorization.

## Access Pathway

CMH funnels all record requests — whether from patients seeking their own records or third parties — through a single generic ROI authorization form. The form's "Purpose" checkboxes (Continuing Care, Insurance, Legal, Other) do not include "Personal use" or "Patient access," forcing a patient requesting their own records to select "Other" and write in a reason. The bidirectional design (Section C has both "Send Records To" and "Request Records From" fields) further signals that this form was designed for inter-facility transfers, not individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The hospital does offer a patient portal (myCMH) for partial record access, but the primary written pathway for requesting complete records is this generic ROI form. There is no evidence of a dedicated patient access request process that distinguishes individual rights from third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page at `columbiamemorial.org/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/` links directly to both the English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative search strategies were needed — basic website navigation sufficed. The page also prominently states that "Records are free to patients who request their records," which is a notable positive signal adjacent to the form links.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a cleanly structured 2-page PDF with five labeled sections (A through E). Page 1 is the patient-facing authorization; page 2 is for hospital administrative use only. The layout is logical and navigable, with clear section headers and a well-organized record-type checklist offering 11 specific categories (Emergency Room, Lab Reports, Imaging, etc.) each with a date-of-service field.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). All data entry relies on printed blank lines, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the PDF was clearly created in a layout tool capable of adding interactive fields.

The language is generally plain and accessible. The opening purpose statement ("This form is an authorization to release protected health information") is clear and direct. The signature block language is standard without excessive legalese. There are no instructions or guidance text beyond the section labels, and no statement of patient rights beyond the required notice about entitlement to a copy of the signed authorization.

Submission methods are not explicitly stated on the form itself, though the header lists both a phone number and fax number. The page 2 hospital-use section tracks delivery via "Pt. Pick-Up," "Mailed," "Faxed," and "Electronic" — but these are staff-facing fields, not patient-facing options. A patient filling out the form independently would have to infer that faxing is acceptable.

## Barriers and Compliance

CMH demonstrates several positive practices: no notarization or witness requirement, no in-person mandate, and an explicit commitment to free records for patient access (stated on the website, though not on the form itself). Processing time is stated as 72–96 business hours.

The primary compliance concern is the absence of explicit expiration date/event language and revocation instructions in the form text — elements required by HIPAA § 164.508(c)(1)(v) for valid authorizations. Additionally, the form includes no reference to patient rights under HIPAA, no information about fees on the form itself, and no delivery format options for the patient.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Bilingual form availability (English and Spanish) is uncommon, especially for a small rural critical access hospital, and demonstrates attention to community language needs. The explicit "records are free" statement is exemplary transparency. The well-organized section structure makes the form more navigable than many single-block authorization forms.

**Red flags:** The Spanish form is nearly 8 years older than the English version (2017 vs. 2025), creating a risk that Spanish-speaking patients encounter outdated language or missing sections. Page 2 of the Spanish form is entirely untranslated. The form's missing expiration/revocation language may render signed authorizations technically non-compliant.

## Overall Assessment

Columbia Memorial Hospital provides a reasonably accessible, well-organized ROI process with commendable bilingual availability and fee transparency. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and gaps in compliance language prevent it from achieving the highest marks. A patient can get their records here without unreasonable barriers, but the process was not designed with the individual access use case as a priority.

# Synthesis: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital

## Overview

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital in Murfreesboro, TN is part of Ascension, the largest nonprofit Catholic health system in the U.S. For medical records requests, the hospital relies on two pathways: a **Swellbox-based online request wizard** (the primary pathway linked from the patient portal page) and a **downloadable PDF authorization form** (STHS490) shared across the entire Ascension Saint Thomas system in Tennessee. Only the PDF form was available for detailed evaluation. No dedicated patient access request form was found — the single PDF serves both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information at the form level. The PDF form (STHS490) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Disclosure of PHI" that handles both use cases through a single "and/or" construction: patients can check "Use my health information" and/or "Disclose my health information to the following individual or organization." A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same form — including specifying themselves as the recipient — as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), the 30-day response obligation, or patient-specific fee limits.

However, the existence of the **Swellbox online wizard** as the primary pathway is significant. Though we could not evaluate the wizard's internal design, the fact that patients are directed to an online request tool — rather than solely to a downloadable PDF — suggests a more modern and potentially more patient-friendly experience as the default path. This partially mitigates the generic nature of the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form was **easy**. A targeted Google search on the second attempt returned a direct link. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or browser fallback was needed. The form is hosted on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure (the URL path includes "legacy"), suggesting it predates the current website architecture and is discoverable primarily via search engines rather than site navigation. The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, is linked from the patient portal page via normal site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF form (STHS490) is a **single page** — concise and complete. It uses a numbered structure (items 1–7) with a logical flow from patient identification through record type selection, rights notice, and signature. The record type checklist (ten options plus "Other") gives patients meaningful control over scope. Contact phone numbers for all eight Saint Thomas facilities are listed, which is helpful.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. The layout is dense, with small fonts (likely 8–9pt in places) cramming all content onto one page. Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese, particularly in the revocation clause (item 5). There are no separate instructions, no multilingual versions, and no plain-language summary of patient rights.

The form offers **mail and email delivery** checkboxes (item 7), which is better than forms limited to mail or in-person pickup. Combined with the Swellbox wizard for online submission, a patient has viable electronic pathways available.

## Barriers

The most notable barrier is the **SSN field combined with "ALL BLANKS MUST BE COMPLETED"** — implying SSN is mandatory. HIPAA does not require SSN for a records authorization, and requiring it creates both a privacy risk and a potential deterrent. The form also uses stale branding ("Saint Thomas Health" in body text vs. "Ascension Saint Thomas" in footer) and has a filename/form number mismatch (sths409 vs. STHS490), which are minor but erode trust in document currency.

No notarization or witness is required. No fees are mentioned on the form. The six-month default expiration is reasonable.

## Strengths

- **Online alternative (Swellbox wizard)** as the primary pathway
- **Email delivery option** on the PDF form
- **Granular record type checklist** with helpful descriptions
- **HIM contact numbers** for all facilities listed directly on the form
- **Easy findability** — no search difficulties

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox online wizard as the primary pathway is a meaningful strength that elevates the organization above those relying solely on PDF forms. However, the PDF form itself — the only document available for detailed evaluation — is a generic third-party authorization form with no fillable fields, an implied SSN requirement, and no acknowledgment of patient self-access as a distinct right. The organization earns credit for offering electronic pathways but falls short on patient-centeredness and form document quality.

# Community Health Centers of Burlington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Community Health Centers of Burlington (CHCB) provides two downloadable PDF forms for health information disclosure. **Form-1** ("Authorization to Send Health Information," revised November 2023) is the primary ROI form — a one-page, fillable PDF covering medical, mental health/psychiatric, and dental records. **Form-2** ("Authorization for Verbal Communication (Only)") is a companion form limited to verbal disclosures; it explicitly states "No paper records will be sent" and is not relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own records.

No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or web-based form wizard was identified. The primary pathway for a patient requesting records is to download form-1, complete it, and submit it — though submission instructions are notably absent from the form itself.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

CHCB does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization/disclosure form designed to serve all release purposes. However, it includes a "Patient copy" checkbox under "Reason for Release" alongside options like "Coordination of care," "Transfer care," and "Legal purposes." This checkbox normalizes patient self-access as a legitimate use case, even though the form's structure — with "Information REQUESTED FROM" and "Information RELEASED TO" blocks — is oriented toward third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate sender/recipient fields that don't map intuitively to a self-access request, creating potential confusion.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), nor does it include plain-language statements about patient rights to access their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required a site-scoped web search (`site:chcb.org`), which immediately returned a direct link to the PDF in a WordPress uploads directory. The organization's own forms page (`chcb.org/forms/`) did not render content — likely due to JavaScript rendering — meaning a patient navigating the website directly would have difficulty finding the form without resorting to a search engine. No bot-blocking or download difficulties were encountered. Findability is moderate: easily searchable but not prominently surfaced through the site's own navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-executed digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 36 interactive form fields, a clean text layer, and a modest 164 KB file size. The one-page design is impressively compact, covering three record categories (medical, mental health, dental) with date ranges, legal disclosures, and a revocation section. The layout is dense but readable, using bold headers, checkboxes, and horizontal rules to organize content.

Language is a mix of accessible plain English in the record-selection sections and standard legal boilerplate in the disclosure paragraph. The record type options are well-designed — patients can choose complete records or specify particular items, with date ranges available for medical and mental health categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

**No submission instructions.** The most significant gap is the absence of any guidance on how to submit the completed form. The header lists a fax number and email for receiving records *at* CHCB, but there is no explicit instruction for returning the completed authorization. A patient would likely have to call the office to ask. **No fees are mentioned** — neither disclosed nor waived. **No notarization** is required, and the form explicitly states that photocopies and facsimiles are valid, removing a common barrier. The conditioning-of-treatment language is legally accurate but could intimidate patients. A line about verbal communication, apparently carried over from the verbal-only companion form, creates minor confusion about what the form authorizes.

## Notable Strengths

- **"Patient copy" checkbox** explicitly normalizes patient self-access as a standard reason for release
- **One-page fillable PDF** with 36 interactive fields enables complete digital form-filling
- **Photocopy/facsimile acceptance** explicitly stated, removing an access barrier
- **Granular record selection** with date ranges gives patients control over scope
- **Revocation section** clearly states the right to revoke consent at any time

## Overall Assessment

CHCB provides a technically competent, concise authorization form that a patient *can* use to request their own records, but the experience is not designed around patient self-access. The generic disclosure framing, absence of submission instructions, lack of patient rights language, and sender/recipient confusion when used for self-access all point to a form built for provider-to-provider information exchange that accommodates patients as a secondary use case. The fillable design and compact layout are genuine strengths, but the missing submission pathway is a meaningful gap in the patient experience.

# Barrett Hospital & HealthCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Barrett Hospital & HealthCare is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Dillon, Montana. The organization offers a single pathway for patients requesting their medical records: a one-page PDF authorization form linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page on its Wix-hosted website. Only one form was found during the retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Barrett Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole form — titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios, including inter-provider transfers, third-party releases, and patient access. The form includes dual "RECEIVE from" / "RELEASE to" fields, a compensation disclosure clause, and language about conditioning treatment on signing — elements that are appropriate for third-party authorizations but inappropriate and potentially confusing when a patient is simply exercising their HIPAA right of access under § 164.524. There is no mention of patient access rights anywhere on the form.

The "Purpose" field does include "Personal Use" as a circled option, which is the closest the form comes to acknowledging patient self-access. However, this is a single option among several on a general-purpose form, not a dedicated pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search quickly identified the "Request Medical Records" page, which features a clearly labeled download link. For a small rural critical access hospital, this level of web accessibility is commendable — many larger organizations make their forms harder to find. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **natively digital PDF but not fillable** — it has zero interactive form fields. Patients must print, handwrite their responses on blank lines, and return the form via fax, mail, or in-person pickup. The "circle one" instructions for format and delivery options confirm the print-and-handwrite design intent.

Despite the non-fillable limitation, the form is well-organized and concise at a single page. It follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → date ranges → format/delivery → legal notices → signature. The record-type section uses an efficient tabular layout with per-category date ranges. The turnaround time ("10 days") is stated prominently at the top — a practice many organizations neglect entirely.

The language is mostly plain, though the legal paragraphs at the bottom are denser. The "Initial" column in the record-type table is ambiguous — patients are apparently expected to initial next to each record type they want, but this is never explained. The abbreviation "Disc" next to imaging options is also cryptic.

The form collects last four digits of SSN, which is unnecessary under HIPAA for identity verification and may deter some patients. Delivery options include pick up, fax, and mail — fax qualifies as an electronic submission pathway per our scoring baseline, so the organization meets the minimum for remote submission.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant compliance issue is the conditioning language: "I understand that I may refuse this authorization and that my refusal to sign may affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment or my eligibility for benefits." Under HIPAA § 164.524, providers cannot condition treatment on a patient's willingness to authorize access to their own records. Because this dual-purpose form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release, this problematic language is presented to all requestors regardless of context.

The compensation disclosure clause ("I understand that _____ will receive compensation for its use/disclosure of the information") is similarly irrelevant for patient access requests and adds confusion. No fee schedule is disclosed on the form or the website's medical records page.

## Strengths

- **Easy findability** with a dedicated medical records page and clear download link
- **Concise single-page design** that reduces patient burden
- **Stated turnaround time** of 10 days sets clear expectations
- **Fax submission available**, providing a remote electronic pathway
- **42 CFR Part 2 and redisclosure notices** are properly included

## Overall Assessment

Barrett Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of small independent hospitals. The form is easy to find, reasonably organized, and concise, but it is a generic third-party authorization form repurposed for all disclosure purposes — including patient self-access — without any differentiation. The non-fillable PDF and conditioning language are the most notable shortcomings. For a critical access hospital with limited resources, the web presence and form accessibility are respectable, but the organization misses the mark on patient-centeredness by failing to treat individual access as distinct from third-party release.

# Lexington Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Lexington Medical Center (West Columbia, SC) publishes three documents on its Medical Records page at lexhealth.com/medical-records: an English-language "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (form-1), a full Spanish translation of the same form (form-2), and a supplemental Reproductive Health Attestation form (form-3) implementing the 2024 HIPAA privacy rule. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a two-page general-purpose ROI authorization. The website also mentions MyChart as a digital option for records requests, though that portal-based pathway was not directly evaluated.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lexington Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic authorization: "I authorize the following provider/entity _____ to release my health information to: Recipient/Provider Name: _____." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly designate themselves as both the authorizer and the recipient — an unintuitive workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no separate patient access form, and no language explaining that patients have a legal right to obtain their own records. The form funnels all requests — whether to insurers, attorneys, family members, or the patient themselves — through the same third-party release authorization framework.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which links directly to all three PDFs. No bot blocking, no JavaScript rendering issues, and no portal login was required. The Medical Records page provides context for both digital (MyChart) and paper-based requests. This is a well-organized web presence for records access information.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a digitally-authored, text-based PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores and all checkboxes are non-interactive symbol characters. Patients must print and complete the form by hand. The layout is well-organized into three clear sections: patient identification and routing, medical records release details with a granular record-type checklist (~25 categories), and review/authorization terms with a signature block. At two pages, the length is appropriate. Language is moderately formal — not impenetrable legalese, but not plain language either. The authorization conditions (Section 3) use standard legal register that most adults could follow with careful reading.

Submission is limited on the form itself: the only method stated is postal mail ("Mail completed form to: Lexington Health Attn: Medical Records, 2720 Sunset Blvd."). However, Condition 6 states that "a copy or fax of this document is just as valid as the original document," implying fax submission would be accepted, though no fax number is provided for the records department. The website separately references MyChart for digital requests.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness signature** is required — a welcome absence. The form also explicitly accepts copies and faxes as valid. However, there are notable concerns:

- **Full SSN collection**: The form requests the patient's complete Social Security Number as a top-level identifier, which is unnecessary for HIPAA purposes and creates identity theft risk on a document designed to be mailed.
- **Blanket substance abuse/psychiatric disclosure**: Condition 1 states that alcohol abuse, psychiatric, drug abuse, and communicable disease records "will be released" with no opt-out, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records.
- **Undisclosed fees**: Patients are told "there may be a charge" and must call (803) 791-2264 to learn the amount — no upfront fee transparency.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires in 90 days, which is short but generally adequate for a single records request.

## Notable Strengths

The **Spanish-language version** (form-2) is a full professional translation co-located with the English form — not buried in a separate section. It uniquely includes an interpreter services phone number with conference call instructions, a thoughtful accessibility touch. The **granular record-type checklist** gives patients meaningful control over what gets released. The **Reproductive Health Attestation** (form-3) demonstrates proactive compliance with recent HIPAA regulatory changes, ahead of many peer organizations.

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Medical Center makes its forms easy to find and offers a well-organized, bilingual paper-based workflow. However, the process fundamentally treats patient self-access as indistinguishable from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a generic authorization form not designed for their needs. The non-fillable PDF and mail-only submission (on the form itself) create unnecessary friction in an era of digital health records. The SSN collection and blanket substance abuse disclosure represent compliance concerns. The organization earns credit for findability, bilingual access, and clear layout, but falls short on patient-centeredness and technical accessibility.

# Troy Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Troy Regional Medical Center is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Troy, Alabama. The organization presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in the study: the only ROI form available is a decade-old, image-only scanned PDF hosted on a defunct legacy website, with no corresponding page or link on the hospital's current site.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page "Release of Information/PHI" authorization (form-1.pdf), dated February 2015. It is a general-purpose third-party release authorization—not a patient-access-specific form—though it does include a "Self" checkbox among the recipient options (alongside Physician, Attorney, and Other). No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

The form offers three delivery methods via checkbox: mail, fax, and in-person pickup. However, the form itself contains **no submission instructions**—no mailing address, fax number, email address, or department name. A patient who downloads and completes this form would have no idea where to send it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Troy Regional Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization that treats a patient requesting their own records identically to an attorney or physician requesting records on someone's behalf. The form's legal language—including a broad liability waiver and re-disclosure warnings—is oriented toward third-party release scenarios and is conceptually mismatched when a patient checks "Self."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required exceptional effort. The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) has no medical records page, no HIM department listing, and no downloadable forms. The Patient Information page returned a 502 Bad Gateway error. The form was ultimately located only on the hospital's legacy FastHealth-hosted site (trmc.fasthealth.com), which is no longer linked from the current site. A real patient navigating the current website would almost certainly fail to find this form. Only archival web searching revealed it.

## Form Document Quality

The form is an image-only scan (grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI) with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers, cannot be searched or copied, and must be printed and filled entirely by hand. The scan quality introduces some blur, and the legal text is in small (approximately 9–10pt) type. It is served over unencrypted HTTP.

Despite the poor technical quality, the visual layout is reasonably organized. The title is clear, fields flow logically from demographics to record type selection to signatures, and the form fits on a single page. Record type granularity is adequate, with 10+ checkbox options plus an "Entire Record" option and date range fields.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Several significant barriers are present:

- **"All fields MUST be completed" warning**: The form states that any blank field renders the authorization invalid—an overreach beyond HIPAA's actual requirements that could deter patients who cannot provide every piece of information.
- **Broad liability waiver**: Patients must discharge the facility from "any and all liabilities" as a condition of signing—not a HIPAA requirement and inappropriate for patient self-access.
- **Witness signature required**: A witness signature line adds an unnecessary step with no legal basis under HIPAA for patient access requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no contact information for where to send the completed authorization.
- **Anti-conditioning language contradicts itself**: The form states treatment may not be conditioned on authorization, then immediately notes that "if conditioning is permitted, refusal to sign... may result in denial of care."

## Strengths

The only modest bright spot is the record type granularity—patients can select specific record types or request the entire record, with date range specification. The form also correctly references revocation rights.

## Overall Assessment

Troy Regional Medical Center's patient access experience is among the poorest possible. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, image-only scan quality, generic third-party framing, multiple compliance red flags, and a form that is over a decade old paints a picture of an organization that has not invested in patient access infrastructure. A patient attempting to request their own records online from this facility would face a near-impossible task.

# EyeSouth Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a practice management organization (PMO) headquartered in Atlanta, GA, operating a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. It is a HIPAA covered entity with a designated Privacy Officer, but the corporate website is entirely partnership-focused with no patient-facing content. Two ROI forms were retrieved — neither from EyeSouth Partners itself, but from individual affiliates: Center for Sight (Florida) and Georgia Retina (Georgia).

## Available Pathways

A patient seeking records from an EyeSouth Partners affiliate faces a fragmented landscape. The parent organization offers no downloadable form, no patient portal, and no records request page. Its privacy policy directs patients to write to the Privacy Officer at corporate headquarters — a mail-only pathway with no form to guide the request. Individual affiliates handle records requests independently: some offer downloadable PDF forms (Center for Sight, Georgia Retina), others use third-party online portals like Sharecare (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye Partners), and at least one has a broken forms page (Georgia Eye Partners, returning 404).

The most relevant forms for patient self-access are the two retrieved PDF forms. **Form 1** (Center for Sight) is a concise, plain-language "Medical Information Release Form" with a patient-friendly tone and 10-business-day processing commitment. **Form 2** (Georgia Retina) is a more detailed "Authorization for Use, Release, or Request of Your Health Information" with HIPAA rights statements but also a $25 fee disclosure and a reason-for-release requirement. Both are one-page, single-purpose authorization forms. Form 1 represents the better patient experience overall and is treated as the primary form for scoring purposes.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to move records "to or from" the affiliated practice. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal right to their own records without needing to provide a reason. The parent organization provides no pathway at all — a patient who only knows they received care "under EyeSouth Partners" would struggle to find any usable process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms required significant effort. Direct searches for "EyeSouth Partners" ROI forms returned nothing. The corporate website has no patient resources section. Forms were located only by identifying specific affiliated practices and searching their individual websites. This multi-step, knowledge-dependent process is a major barrier: a patient must already know which specific practice treated them, find that practice's website, and hope a form is posted there.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms have a text layer (not image-only scans) but **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete by hand. Form 1 uses plain, accessible language with a logical top-down flow (patient info → sender/receiver → date range → reasons → authorization → signature). Its listing of 11 Center for Sight locations with full addresses and fax numbers is dense but functional for identifying where to send the form. Form 2 is more text-dense, with rights disclosures consuming half the page and no visual section headers or dividers. Neither form offers checkboxes for record types, format/delivery options, or electronic submission instructions.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form 1 contains an indefinite authorization ("will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing") with no automatic expiration — potentially problematic under HIPAA § 164.508. Form 2 discloses a flat $25 fee for record reproduction without distinguishing patient access requests (where HIPAA fee limits apply) from third-party releases. Form 2 also asks patients to "list the reason for releasing this information," which HIPAA does not require for patient access. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both imply fax submission is available through listed fax numbers. Form 2 is dated June 2016 — nearly a decade old, predating the HHS Right of Access Initiative and the Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Notable Strengths

- Form 1's 10-business-day processing commitment sets a clear, HIPAA-compliant expectation
- Form 1's warm closing ("we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care") is unusually humanizing
- Both forms are appropriately concise at one page each
- No notarization or witness requirements on either form

## Overall Assessment

EyeSouth Partners presents a below-average patient experience for records access. The fundamental problem is structural: a decentralized PMO with no centralized patient-facing process, forcing patients to navigate affiliate-specific pathways that vary widely in approach and quality. The best available forms are generic authorization documents that don't recognize patient self-access as a distinct use case. While the forms themselves are functional and concise, their paper-first design (no fillable fields), lack of patient rights language, and compliance issues (indefinite authorization, flat fee, reason requirement) prevent them from achieving more than a middling score. The organization earns a **C** grade, reflecting adequate but unexceptional service that requires a patient to work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights.

# Bayshore Medical Center — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Bayshore Medical Center, part of the Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) system, routes patients through the system-wide infrastructure for medical records requests. Six documents were retrieved during the search process, but only two are directly relevant for a Bayshore patient requesting their own records: the **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary English pathway) and the **CMR-003 authorization form** (form-6, a 2-page PDF covering all 11 HMH hospitals). A Spanish companion form (CMR-003S, form-3) mirrors the English PDF. Additional documents include an older Medical Group outpatient release form (form-1, dated 2018), two forms from sister facility Pascack Valley (forms 2 and 5), and a records amendment form (form-4).

The primary pathway for English-speaking patients is the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, linked from the HMH system-wide Medical Records page under "Request Records." Spanish-speaking patients are directed to the CMR-003S PDF download. Notably, the English PDF version of CMR-003 is **not linked** from the Medical Records page — it was found only through web search under an inconsistent URL path (medical-group/patient-forms rather than patients-visitors).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Bayshore does not offer a dedicated patient self-access PDF form. The CMR-003 PDF is a generic HIPAA authorization framed around third-party disclosure: "I authorize Hackensack Meridian Health to release information to: Organization/Recipient." A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name as the "recipient" and select "Personal use" from five purpose options — an awkward workaround. The online portal (Swellbox/Datavant) likely provides a more patient-centric experience as the primary pathway, but the PDF form does not distinguish between individual access and third-party release.

Interestingly, Pascack Valley Medical Center (an HMH sister facility) offers a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-5) with patient-first language and a "Myself" default recipient option. This demonstrates that the HMH system has the concept of a dedicated patient-access form but has not standardized it across all facilities.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the relevant forms required significant effort. The search involved web searches, site-specific navigation, URL pattern guessing, and cross-facility comparison. The Bayshore Medical Center sub-page links to the HMH Medical Records page (2–3 clicks), which prominently features the Swellbox portal but buries the PDF forms. The English CMR-003 was located via web search under the Medical Group directory — a misleading location for a hospital-level form. Retrieval difficulty: **hard**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary PDF form (CMR-003, form-6) is a born-digital 2-page document with a clean text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print and hand-write all entries. This is particularly notable given that HMH's own amendment form (form-4) has 54 fillable fields — proving the organization has the capability but did not apply it to the ROI form. The layout is logically structured with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient info → recipient → location → records → purpose → sensitive-record consent → signature → delivery format. Record type granularity is good (11 categories) and delivery format options are comprehensive (paper, encrypted USB/CD, fax, secured email).

Language is a mix of plain and legal. Core instructions are clear, but the minor consent section and legal disclosures use dense, nested phrasing. The form lacks explicit submission instructions — while the contact directory on page 2 lists HIM phone and fax numbers for each campus, the form never tells patients *how* to submit the completed authorization. The fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee… Please ask."

## Barriers and Bright Spots

No notarization, in-person submission, or witness requirements exist. Fax submission is available (Bayshore HIM fax: 732-888-7332), providing an adequate electronic pathway. The vague fee disclosure and absent submission instructions are minor barriers.

The standout bright spot is the **EHI Export option** — an explicit offer to provide records in a machine-readable format uploadable to another EHR. This is exceptionally rare on ROI forms and directly supports 21st Century Cures Act interoperability goals (despite the typo "Electric" instead of "Electronic" Health Record). The Spanish companion form, comprehensive contact directory, and granular sensitive-record consent are additional strengths.

## Overall Assessment

Bayshore Medical Center, via HMH, provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox/Datavant portal offers a digital-first primary pathway, and the PDF form — while non-fillable and oriented toward third-party release — includes progressive features like EHI Export and multilingual availability. The main weaknesses are the difficult findability of the English PDF, the generic authorization framing that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, and the lack of fillable fields on a form that could easily support them. Grade: **B**.

# Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Chandler, AZ, with eight office locations across the Phoenix metro area. Three documents were retrieved: an incoming records request form (form-1), the primary outbound ROI authorization form (form-2), and a new patient forms packet from a sister site (form-3). Only form-2 serves a patient requesting their own records from Ironwood.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Ironwood does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-2, a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" designed to serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party release, legal, insurance, and disability. The form uses a "To" and "From" field structure oriented toward third-party transfers, which can confuse patients seeking their own records. However, "Personal Use" is explicitly listed as the first purpose option, which partially signals awareness of patient self-access as a legitimate use case.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or use individual-access-specific language. A patient must navigate a form designed around third-party release and determine which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the ROI form required **moderate-to-significant effort**. The patient forms page at ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/ existed but did not expose downloadable links — possibly due to JavaScript rendering requirements or link removal. The primary ROI form (form-2) was only discoverable via site-specific search engine queries. Its URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/`) suggests it dates from March 2019 and may be effectively orphaned. Ironically, the incoming records form (form-1) was updated more recently (November 2023) and is fillable, suggesting the organization invested in making it easy for other providers to send records to Ironwood while neglecting the patient-facing release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable/interactive fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a notable gap, especially given that form-1 (the incoming records form) has 22 fillable fields. The asymmetry suggests intentional or negligent underinvestment in the patient-facing document.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → record types → date range → purpose → delivery method → legal disclosures → signatures. Seven record type categories (physician's notes, lab reports, radiology reports, biopsy reports, prescriptions, radiology imaging, plus "Other") provide reasonable granularity for a cancer center. Five delivery methods are offered: fax, secure email, mail, pick up, and patient portal — a strong set of options including two electronic channels beyond fax.

The form lacks any introductory instructions or plain-language guidance. Legal disclosures are presented in dense paragraph format on page 2, though "I UNDERSTAND THAT" headers provide some scannability. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions available.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fee disclosure is vague: "A fee may be charged for providing the protected health information" — no amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees. This ambiguity could discourage patients.

No notarization or witness signature is required. The non-conditioning statement is present and appropriate. Revocation rights are clearly stated. The authorization expires after one year, which is standard.

A notable red flag on form-1 (though not the primary patient form): the STD definition section cites Washington state law (RCW 70.24) despite Ironwood being an Arizona practice — a template-copy error that raises questions about form review diligence.

## Strengths

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: Offering secure email and patient portal alongside fax, mail, and pickup gives patients meaningful choice — better than many comparable practices.
- **"Personal Use" as an explicit purpose**: Listing this as the first purpose option is a small but meaningful signal of patient access awareness.
- **Reasonable record type granularity**: The checkbox categories are well-suited to oncology records.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable patient form vs. fillable provider form**: The clearest indicator of misaligned priorities.
- **Orphaned form**: Not linked from any active webpage; discoverable only via search engines.
- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Generic authorization for all release types.
- **Vague fee language**: Could deter patients from exercising their access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers provides a **minimally adequate** but clearly deprioritized pathway for patient self-access to records. The generic authorization form technically works for patient self-access, and the inclusion of electronic delivery options (secure email, patient portal) is a genuine strength. However, the non-fillable form, orphaned web presence, vague fee language, and lack of any patient-access-specific design collectively signal that individual record access is not a priority for this organization. A patient can get their records, but only after navigating search engines to find a form that wasn't designed for them.

# Phelps Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Memorial Health Center is a small independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Holdrege, Nebraska. The organization offers a single ROI form — a one-page "Request for Release of Information" — that serves as the sole documented pathway for patients requesting their medical records. No patient portal–based request option, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway

Phelps Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization used for all purposes — releasing records to another provider, to a third party, or to the patient themselves. "Patient" appears as one of three checkbox options under "Release Records To" (alongside "Provider/Hospital" and "Other Person"), and an in-person inspection option is included, but there is no dedicated workflow or separate form for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as an attorney or insurer, selecting the applicable checkboxes and ignoring fields meant for third-party recipients.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was **easy to find via web search** — a basic query for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned a direct link to the PDF. However, the form is **not linked from the organization's patient forms page**, which only lists a Patient History Form and New Patient Form. A patient browsing the website through normal navigation would not discover the ROI form. The PDF is hosted at a raw Drupal file path with no landing page or contextual instructions.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but with zero interactive form fields. All blanks are underscored lines intended for handwriting. The form must be printed, filled out by hand, and returned via fax (two fax numbers are listed in the footer) or in person. No electronic fill-and-submit workflow exists.

**Layout and organization** are logical — the form flows top-to-bottom from patient identification through record source, recipient, purpose, record type selection, legal language, and signature. However, the single page is moderately cramped, and administrative fields ("Release completed by:", "MR #:") appear prominently at the top, potentially confusing patients who may think they need to fill them in.

**Language** is mixed: the top half uses plain, accessible phrasing with straightforward checkboxes, while the bottom half presents dense legal paragraphs covering HIPAA rights, revocation, treatment conditioning, and sensitive information disclosures. The legal text includes a factual error — citing "Health Information Portability and Accountability Act" instead of the correct "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no unreasonable barriers**: no notarization or witness required, no in-person-only submission (fax is available), and appropriate anti-conditioning language is included with a specific HIPAA citation (§ 164.508). Fee disclosure is transparent and reasonable — first 10 pages are free, $0.25/page thereafter, $10 for CD — which is more generous than many providers. The form also includes a "COMPLETE HEALTH RECORD" checkbox, simplifying requests for patients who want everything.

Concerns include the **calendar-year expiration** ("Release effective until the end of this year"), which creates an inconsistent authorization window depending on when the patient signs. The form is dated August 2017 and has not been updated in over eight years, raising questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **First 10 pages free**: Reduces cost burden for routine patient access requests.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Accomplishes a complete ROI authorization concisely.
- **"Complete Health Record" option**: Lets patients request everything without needing to select individual categories.
- **Anti-conditioning language**: Explicitly states treatment cannot be conditioned on signing.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields**: Entirely print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Not linked from website navigation**: Findable only via search engine.
- **Generic form for all purposes**: No differentiation for patient self-access.
- **HIPAA name error and outdated form**: Suggests lack of recent legal review.
- **Staff fields on patient-facing form**: "Release completed by" and "MR #" may confuse patients.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Memorial Health Center provides a functional but basic records request process. The single-page form is efficient and the fee structure is patient-friendly, but the lack of fillable fields, absence from website navigation, and failure to distinguish patient access from third-party release place this organization squarely in the middle tier. The form gets the job done but reflects a paper-era workflow that has not been updated to serve the modern patient experience. **Grade: C.**

# Mayers Memorial Hospital District — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were found for Mayers Memorial Hospital District, a government-owned critical access hospital in Fall River Mills, California:

1. **form-2.pdf** — A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" branded with the hospital's name, adapted from the California Hospital Association template (CHA 16-1, March 2013). This is hosted directly on the hospital website but critically mislabeled as "Disclosure of Privacy Practices" in the site navigation. It is the hospital's primary ROI authorization form (form number MMH 470).

2. **form-1.pdf** — A 1-page generic, unbranded "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It was found only through web search and is not linked from any page on the hospital website.

For a patient requesting their own records, **form-2.pdf is the most relevant** — it is the branded hospital form, includes a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose, and contains a substantive "My Rights" section. However, both forms are fundamentally structured as third-party release authorizations.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mayers Memorial does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms require patients to fill in a recipient's name and address, meaning a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own contact information as the "recipient." Form-2 partially acknowledges patient self-access through a "Patient request" checkbox, but the workflow remains identical to a third-party release. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding a usable form was **difficult**. The hospital's Medical Records page provides only department hours and a phone number — no downloadable form, no request instructions. The branded form (form-2) is linked from the Patients & Visitors page under the misleading label "Disclosure of Privacy Practices," a title that describes an entirely different type of document. A patient looking for a records release form would likely skip this link. The generic form-1 is only discoverable through external web search leading to a third-party CDN URL.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-2** (the primary form) is an **image-only scan** with no text layer and no fillable fields. It cannot be searched, copied from, or read by screen readers — a significant accessibility failure. Despite the poor digital format, its content is reasonably well-structured: clear section headers, checkboxes for record scope (all records vs. specific types), granular sensitive-information checkboxes (mental health, HIV, substance abuse) each requiring initials, and a "My Rights" section written in plain first-person language. Estimated field count is approximately 15 fields across 2 pages.

**Form-1** has a text layer (digitally created) but also lacks fillable fields and is far less complete — no checkboxes, no scope options, no rights statement, and no HIPAA-required authorization elements (expiration, revocation).

Neither form provides any submission instructions — no fax number, mailing address, email, or portal link. A patient who completes the form has no documented path to submit it without calling the hospital.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions on either form**: The most critical barrier — patients cannot determine how to return a completed form.
- **Image-only scan** (form-2): Completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.
- **Intimidating opening language** (form-2): "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — potentially chilling for patients who lack details like their MRN.
- **Mislabeled web link**: The form is hidden behind an incorrect label, making it effectively unfindable through normal navigation.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form addresses whether fees will be charged.

## Bright Spots

- The "My Rights" section on form-2 is genuinely well-written in plain first-person language, clearly stating patients' rights to refuse, inspect records, and revoke authorization.
- Sensitive information handling is properly separated with individual checkboxes and initial lines, compliant with California law and 42 CFR Part 2.
- Use of the CHA template ensures baseline legal compliance with California health privacy requirements.

## Overall Assessment

Mayers Memorial provides a below-average patient experience for records access. While the branded form has decent content design rooted in its CHA template, the combination of extremely poor findability, an image-only scan format, absent submission instructions, and no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release creates a frustrating and largely inaccessible process. A patient attempting to request their own records online would struggle at every step — finding the form, reading it with assistive technology, understanding how to complete it for self-access, and figuring out where to submit it.

# Alabama Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Alabama Medical Group, P.C. is an independent, for-profit, multi-specialty physician practice based in Mobile, Alabama. The organization maintains a well-organized website with a dedicated Patient Resources section, including a clearly labeled "Request Medical Records" page. Two forms were found and evaluated: a general-purpose "Request for Release of Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a narrow "Permission to Give Medical Information" form (form-2.pdf) for authorizing family phone access. Only form-1 is relevant for a patient seeking their own records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Third-Party Authorization

Alabama Medical Group does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-1, a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form titled "Request for Release of Information." The form is structured around "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" fields — language designed for inter-provider and third-party transfers, not for a patient requesting their own records. A patient would need to place their own name and address in the "Release To" field, which is workable but not intuitive.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access anywhere on the form. The form frames the entire interaction as consent-to-release rather than as an exercise of a legal right. The purpose checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Evaluation & Treatment, Other) further confirm this is designed for third-party scenarios — a patient requesting their own records would likely select "Other" and write in an explanation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The website is well-organized with a clear path: Patient Resources → Medical Records → Request Medical Records. The form is linked directly from that page as a PDF download. The same form also appears on the "Other Patient Forms" page. No bot blocking, no browser fallback needed, and no significant difficulties were encountered. The duplicate hosting (identical file at two URLs uploaded one month apart) is a minor organizational issue but does not impair access.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but **no fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects patient name (including maiden name), date of birth, Social Security Number, medical record number, recipient/source information with address/phone/fax, purpose, type of information (free-text), sensitive information consent, and multiple signature lines. The field count is approximately 15–18 data points.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow and fits on one page, though this density makes it somewhat cramped. Language is a mix of plain English for identification fields and standard legal boilerplate for the authorization terms. The example prompt for specifying record type — "(Example: Office Notes, Labs, In-Office Testing, all records)" — is a helpful touch. The dual signature block for sensitive information consent (specifically permitting vs. specifically not permitting) gives patients clear control.

However, the form lacks submission instructions — no mailing address, fax number, or email address is printed on it. A patient who downloads the PDF would not know how to return it without navigating back to the website or calling the office. There is also no date range field, no delivery format options, and no mention of electronic delivery.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests a Social Security Number as a standard field, which is unnecessary for a medical records request and creates an identity theft risk. The **employee/witness signature line** at the bottom is ambiguous — if required, it would effectively mandate in-person submission, a significant barrier not required by HIPAA. **No fees are mentioned** on the form, which leaves uncertainty about costs. **No response time** is stated.

The form was uploaded in February 2018 and has apparently not been updated since, suggesting the organization has not revisited its records request process in approximately eight years.

## Notable Strengths

- Easy findability with clear website navigation
- Concise one-page form
- Helpful example text for record type specification
- Clean sensitive information consent design with explicit opt-in/opt-out

## Overall Assessment

Alabama Medical Group provides a **functional but dated** records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it funnels patients through a generic third-party release authorization with no acknowledgment of patient access rights. The flat PDF with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no electronic submission pathway creates a primarily paper-based workflow. The SSN collection and ambiguous witness requirement are concerning. This is a practice that has not modernized its records access process to reflect current patient expectations or HIPAA right-of-access principles.

# MountainView Hospital (Las Vegas, NV) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MountainView Hospital is part of HCA Healthcare's Sunrise Health network in Las Vegas. The facility's own domain (`mountainview-hospital.com`) redirects to the Sunrise Health system website at `sunrisehealthinfo.com`, where all medical records information is centralized. Two PDF forms were found—an English and Spanish version of the same standardized HCA Healthcare authorization form—alongside references to two additional digital pathways: an online Swellbox records request portal and the MyHealthONE patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The medical records page at sunrisehealthinfo.com offers three pathways for patients requesting records: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (in English and Spanish), (2) an online request wizard via Swellbox, and (3) the MyHealthONE patient portal. The primary downloadable form (form-1.pdf, HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21) is a system-wide HCA Healthcare standardized authorization used across all HCA facilities, not specific to MountainView Hospital. The Swellbox portal represents the most streamlined digital option, though the PDF form remains the most prominently linked resource.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MountainView Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves both patient self-requests and third-party release, with a radio-button choice between "At the request of the individual" and "Other 3rd party recipient." While a patient *can* use this form to request their own records, the form's framing—with prominent "Recipient" fields, fax-to-provider-only restrictions, and third-party disclosure language—is clearly oriented toward release-of-information scenarios rather than individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. The form makes no distinction between Right of Access fee limits/timelines and general authorization practices.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was relatively easy. The medical records page is accessible via the main navigation ("For Patients → Medical Records"), and the authorization forms are directly linked with clear labels. The one complication was bot protection: curl requests to the initial download URL returned HTML rather than a PDF, requiring discovery of the actual CDN URL at `hcadam.com`. This is a minor technical obstacle that wouldn't affect a patient using a browser.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a single-page, fully interactive PDF with 52 fillable fields—patients can complete it digitally without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (patient/recipient info, marketing/PHI sale, signatures), with 16 specific record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. Four delivery format options are offered: paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure). The form also includes a rare USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release option, a forward-looking feature for structured data export.

However, the single-page constraint makes the layout quite dense, and some terminology (USCDI, Direct Address, NPI) is jargon that would be opaque to most patients. The language is a mix of plain language and legalese—the six "I understand that..." statements are reasonably clear, but the overall form assumes familiarity with medical records processes.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked optional but unnecessary for records authorization and a data minimization concern.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form states patients may obtain copies "for a reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts, and this language appears in a rights statement that could normalize fee collection even for Right of Access requests.
- **Fax restriction**: "(FAX only to Physician Office / Medical facility)" limits fax delivery destinations and may restrict patient choice.
- **No notarization or witness required**—a positive.
- **No in-person requirement**: Mail, fax, and online portal options are all available.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual**: Full Spanish translation (form-2.pdf) available alongside the English version—meaningful for Las Vegas's significant Spanish-speaking population, though the surrounding web pages remain English-only and some form footer elements were left untranslated.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare and forward-looking inclusion of interoperability standards on an ROI form.
- **Multiple electronic delivery choices**: Four format options with honest risk disclosures.
- **Alternative digital pathways**: Swellbox portal and MyHealthONE patient portal provide additional request channels beyond the PDF.
- **52 fillable fields**: Fully digital-first form design.

## Overall Assessment

MountainView Hospital, through HCA Healthcare's standardized forms and Sunrise Health's website, provides a reasonably accessible records request experience. The form is easy to find, technically well-built, and offers meaningful delivery format choices. The main weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway—patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization form that doesn't distinguish Right of Access rights, fee limits, or timelines. The availability of the Swellbox online portal and MyHealthONE partially compensates for this gap by offering alternative digital pathways. The form earns credit for its fillable design, Spanish availability, and USCDI awareness, but loses points for its generic framing, fee ambiguity, and unnecessary SSN collection.

# Abbeville Area Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Abbeville Area Medical Center (AAMC) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Abbeville, South Carolina. Two documents were found on its website: an authorization form for releasing protected health information (form-1.pdf) and a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices brochure (form-2.pdf). Only the authorization form is relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Patient Self-Access Distinction

AAMC provides a single, generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (HIM 1022) for all record requests. The form is clearly designed for third-party release — it asks the patient to identify a "Name/Facility" recipient and authorize disclosure "to the following individual or group." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the patient and the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no separate pathway or section for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524, and no mention of the right to access one's own records anywhere on the authorization form.

The companion HIPAA brochure (form-2.pdf) does articulate patient rights well, including the right to electronic copies and a 30-day response timeline, but this informational document is entirely disconnected from the authorization workflow. A patient would need to read two separate documents and synthesize the information themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via Patients & Visitors navigation. The PDF is directly linked and downloads without login, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking. The WordPress site is simple and functional. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form is a single page — admirably brief compared to multi-page forms at other organizations. It follows a logical numbered structure: authorization/recipient identification, record type selection (16 specific checkboxes), dates of service, purpose, and signature block. However, the form has significant technical limitations:

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields. All checkboxes are static Unicode characters, and all blanks are underscored lines. A patient must print the PDF and fill it in by hand.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no address, fax number, email, or department contact. A patient downloading this from the website would have no idea where to send the completed form. The fax number and mailing address must be found separately (the NPP brochure provides the Privacy Officer's P.O. Box and phone number).
- **No "All Records" option**: The 16 granular checkboxes are useful for targeted requests but there is no "Complete Medical Record" option for patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Ambiguous fields**: Item 2 ("Date records were printed and/or CD was requested") appears to be an internal staff field but is numbered as if patients should complete it.

The language is a mix of plain English at the top and denser legal boilerplate at the bottom. Required fields are marked with asterisks, but the legend ("* Must Have Information") appears only at the very bottom of the page.

## Barriers

- **Witness requirement**: The form requires two witness signatures (marked with asterisks as required), which goes beyond HIPAA requirements for patient self-access and creates a logistical barrier.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: The form automatically includes authorization to release psychiatric, substance abuse, HIV, and STD records with no opt-out mechanism. Patients who want general medical records but wish to exclude sensitive categories cannot do so.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signing, which could force resubmission if processing is delayed.
- **No fee information**: The form discloses nothing about costs. The NPP brochure vaguely mentions "there will be a charge" without amounts.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: Everything fits on one page, reducing patient burden.
- **Fax acceptance**: The form explicitly states "A faxed copy of this release shall be deemed as having the same effect as the original," enabling remote submission.
- **Granular record-type selection**: The 16 checkboxes give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **NPP quality**: The privacy brochure includes clear language about the right to electronic copies and a 30-day timeline — strong for a small critical access hospital.

## Overall Assessment

AAMC provides a minimally adequate but dated approach to patient record requests. The form is easy to find and mercifully short, but it offers no digital-first workflow, no patient-access-specific pathway, and no submission instructions. A patient must print the form, handwrite their information, find a fax number or mailing address from a separate document, and obtain two witness signatures — all to exercise a fundamental HIPAA right. The organization earns credit for accessibility of retrieval and brevity of form, but loses ground on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and unnecessary barriers. Grade: **C**.

# Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital is a community hospital in Fairfield, Ohio, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system. Medical records requests are managed centrally through the parent system's website at mercy.com, which provides a dedicated medical records request page covering all Mercy Health facilities. The hospital is listed as a checkbox option on the Cincinnati-region authorization form, with a dedicated fax number (513-599-4491).

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were downloaded. **Form-1** is an older Cincinnati-region "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (MHP 0786 Rev 1/19) with a full text layer and 5,192 characters of extractable text. **Form-2** is a newer system-wide version of the same form (printed 2024-01-17), but it is an image-only scan with only 46 characters of metadata — a significant regression in digital accessibility. Form-2 is the version currently linked from the medical records page; form-1's URL still works but is no longer prominently linked.

Beyond PDF forms, Mercy Health offers **MyChart** (patient portal) and an **online eRequest system** through Ciox/Datavant (Swellbox) at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html, providing genuinely electronic alternatives. A **Spanish-language** version of the authorization form is also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for all release-of-information purposes, not dedicated patient access forms. However, the form does accommodate patient self-access reasonably well: **"Self" is the first checkbox** in the recipient section, and the default purpose is "For Personal use if not otherwise stated." The form explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 (the individual right of access provision). While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, patient self-access is clearly a recognized use case rather than an afterthought.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately returned the Mercy Health medical records page. The centralized page is well-organized with facility-specific fax numbers, links to forms (English and Spanish), and information about MyChart and eRequest options. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing the best available PDF form (form-1, the text-layer version): it is a **single-page**, well-organized form with a logical flow from patient demographics through facility selection, date range, record types, recipient, delivery method, purpose, and legal disclosures. The form offers granular record-type checkboxes (10 specific categories plus "Other" and "Entire record") and four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email). Format defaults to electronic (PDF/CD) if unspecified.

However, neither form has **fillable fields** — both require printing and handwriting. Form-1 at least has a proper text layer making it searchable and compatible with assistive technology. Form-2, the currently linked version, is a flat scan that is completely inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally at all. The replacement of a functional digital PDF with an image scan is a notable regression.

## Barriers

- **Photo ID required**: The form states "Photo ID required at the time of request," which could exclude patients without government-issued identification.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "There may be a charge for copies of records" provides no specific amounts or fee schedule.
- **"Standard two years" default**: The "Entire record" option defaults to two years of information unless otherwise specified — patients expecting their full history may receive only a subset.
- No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission — fax, mail, MyChart, and secure email are available.

## Notable Strengths

- Multiple request pathways including MyChart and Swellbox/Datavant online portal
- Spanish-language form available
- "Self" as the first recipient option; electronic format as default
- Explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation
- Single-page form design
- Centralized, easy-to-navigate medical records page

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The availability of MyChart and the Swellbox online portal significantly elevates the digital pathway beyond the PDF forms alone. The PDF forms themselves are adequate in content design but limited by the lack of fillable fields, and the current primary linked form (an image scan) represents a troubling accessibility regression. The generic HIPAA authorization approach — while clearly accommodating patient self-access — falls short of a dedicated patient access pathway. The overall experience is functional but not exemplary.

# Desert Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Regional Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Palm Springs, CA, operated by Desert Care Network, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare. Two forms were found: an English-language ROI authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are 2-page digitally created PDFs available from a dedicated medical records page on the Desert Care Network website.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

Desert Regional does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization for the Release of Health Information" and are structured as third-party disclosure authorizations — the patient authorizes Desert Regional to release records *to* a named recipient. A patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient, an awkward workaround that conflates the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) with the authorization framework of § 164.508. There is no separate form, section, or instructions addressing patient self-access as a distinct use case.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient/patient representative" as one option, but "Continuation of Care" appears as the default/first option, further underscoring the form's third-party orientation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A direct `filetype:pdf` search yielded nothing, but a site-specific search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/patients/request-medical-records`. That page is well-organized, with per-hospital download links in both English and Spanish. Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic downloads, requiring browser-based workarounds — though a patient using a standard browser would not encounter this. Overall, the form is roughly 2–3 clicks from the homepage via a logical navigation path.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is digitally authored with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite. This is a significant missed opportunity given the digital-native construction. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, recipient info, 12 record-type checkboxes, date range, purpose, and delivery method. The layout is logical and readable, following a clear top-to-bottom sequence. Language tilts toward legal/administrative but is not impenetrably dense; the rights section uses standard HIPAA authorization language with four-exception conditional clauses that could benefit from plain-language explanation.

Delivery method options include patient pickup, mail, fax, and email — the inclusion of email is a positive differentiator. The form header provides phone, fax, and email contact for the HIM department, giving patients multiple submission channels.

## Spanish Translation Quality

The Spanish form (form-2.pdf) mirrors the English version in structure and content, but suffers from **pervasive typographical errors** — at least 9 distinct misspellings including "APCIENTE" (PACIENTE), "cofidencialidad" (confidencialidad), and "DIVILGACIÓN" (DIVULGACIÓN). More consequentially, the Spanish form **omits the delivery method section** entirely, meaning Spanish-speaking patients cannot indicate how they want to receive their records. The fax number in the Spanish header also appears truncated. These errors suggest the translation was not professionally reviewed and create a meaningful disparity in service quality for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no mandatory in-person submission, and no explicit fee requirements. Revocation rights and authorization expiration are clearly stated. However, the form says nothing about fees — neither disclosing them nor stating they don't apply for patient access. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, and the rights section covers only authorization-related rights (voluntariness, revocation). There is no mention of electronic health information export or the patient's right to receive records in their requested format.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful for the Coachella Valley's large Spanish-speaking population
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear, per-hospital download links
- **Email as a delivery option** is more progressive than many ROI forms
- **Multiple HIM contact channels** (phone, fax, email) on the form header

## Overall Assessment

Desert Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The primary pathway is a generic third-party release form with no differentiation for patient self-access — a common but patient-unfriendly pattern. The form is reasonably well-organized and findable, but the lack of fillable fields and the poor quality of the Spanish translation diminish the overall experience. A patient can submit via fax or email (adequate electronic pathways), but must first print and handwrite the form. The organization earns credit for bilingual availability and a clear website presence, but falls short on patient-centeredness and digital accessibility.

# Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Penn Medicine (the parent system for HUP) provides two main pathways for patients seeking their medical records. The **primary pathway** for patient self-access is the **myPennMedicine patient portal**, which the organization's website explicitly directs patients toward. The **secondary pathway** is a downloadable PDF — the "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (form UPHS-099-9, revised December 2020) — a system-wide authorization form used across all Penn Medicine facilities.

Two versions of this PDF form were found: the current version (form-1.pdf) hosted on Penn Medicine's own infrastructure, and an outdated 2018 version (form-2.pdf) hosted on a third-party neurology practice website. The current form is the basis for this quality assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Penn Medicine **partially differentiates** patient self-access from third-party release — but only at the website level, not at the form level. The patient access web page directs patients wanting their own records to the myPennMedicine portal, reserving the PDF authorization form for broader disclosure purposes. However, the form itself is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that makes no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. A patient using the form must fill in their own name in the "I request my PHI to be released to" field, which is functional but not intuitive. The form includes one notable sentence acknowledging patient rights: "I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the authorization form required **moderate effort**. A web search surfaced the form from Penn's medical school subdomain (med.upenn.edu). The official Penn Medicine patient access page links to the same form but was initially blocked by **Incapsula bot protection** on programmatic fetches, requiring browser fallback. The form is not immediately discoverable from the Penn Medicine homepage — patients must navigate to Patient Resources → Patient Access Health Information.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a **strong digital artifact** with **70 fillable interactive fields** — covering patient demographics, facility checkboxes, 14 record-type selections, behavioral health/SUD opt-in, delivery method, and signature blocks. The ADA-accessible designation in the filename suggests intentional accessibility design. The layout is well-organized across two pages: page 1 contains the authorization itself, page 2 provides detailed instructions with submission addresses for six Penn Medicine hospitals.

Language quality is mixed: core instructions are clear, but the authorization section uses dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation. The behavioral health consent language is notably well-written and patient-respectful.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Submission method is the key barrier.** The PDF form must be physically mailed to the appropriate hospital's Medical Records Department — there is no fax submission (Penn Medicine explicitly restricts fax to urgent patient care situations), no email submission of the form, and no online submission pathway for the authorization itself. This makes the PDF pathway a predominantly paper-based process despite the excellent digital form.

**Fee transparency is weak.** The form states Penn Medicine "will charge for copying records in accordance with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware law" without specifying amounts. This references state law rather than HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient access, potentially resulting in overcharging. Radiology images are explicitly free.

**Ambulatory carve-out is buried.** The instruction that "Any Ambulatory/Office Visit requests should be addressed to the individual Physician's Office" is on page 2 and could cause patients to miss outpatient records.

## Notable Strengths

- **70 fillable PDF fields** — among the most thoroughly digitized forms encountered
- **ADA-accessible** PDF design with proper text encoding and interactive elements
- **Granular record selection** with 14 types plus behavioral health/SUD opt-in
- **Explicit patient rights language** acknowledging the right to inspect records directly
- **Free radiology images** — a patient-friendly policy
- **Clear compliance provisions**: 30/60-day response timelines, denial/appeal rights with Chief Privacy Officer contact, no notarization required, treatment not conditioned on signing

## Overall Assessment

Penn Medicine demonstrates institutional competence in form design — the fillable PDF is technically excellent and the instructions are thorough. However, the organization's approach to patient self-access is bifurcated: the portal handles self-access while the PDF form serves as a general-purpose disclosure authorization that doesn't optimize for individual access rights. The mail-only submission requirement for the PDF form is a meaningful barrier. A patient who cannot or does not use the portal faces a paper-based workflow despite the digitally fillable form. For a major academic medical center, the gap between the quality of the form document and the quality of the submission/delivery infrastructure is notable.

# Advocare, LLC — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Advocare, LLC provides three downloaded authorization forms and an online submission alternative:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): The current English-language "Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information," a 2-page fillable PDF with 41 interactive fields, revised January 2026. Linked directly from the official medical records page.
- **form-3.pdf**: A Spanish-language translation of the same authorization form, dated January 2024, with 44 fillable fields. Also linked from the medical records page.
- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An older single-page version (v2, April 2021) found on a different CDN path, likely from an individual practice sub-site. It has zero fillable fields and includes a Social Security Number field that the current version removed.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, Advocare's medical records page offers an **online request option via ShareCare** and a separate third-party requester portal. The PDF forms list mail and email as delivery options, and fax is implicitly available through their practice offices.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocare does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release. All three PDF forms are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for disclosure to third parties. However, form-2 includes a **"Patient Request" checkbox** under the purpose field, acknowledging patient-initiated requests. The structural awkwardness remains: a patient requesting their own records must still fill out "recipient" fields, essentially listing themselves as the party receiving disclosure. This is a common industry pattern but reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-access-first design.

The ShareCare online portal provides an alternative pathway, though it was not evaluated as a downloaded form in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Advocare's forms was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page, which clearly links to downloadable PDFs in English and Spanish, the ShareCare online portal, and a third-party requester portal. No bot blocking, authentication, or browser workarounds were needed. The only minor issue is that the legacy form-1.pdf remains discoverable via web search, creating a risk that patients could find and submit an outdated document.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2.pdf is a **born-digital, fillable PDF** with 41 interactive fields — a significant improvement over the legacy form-1 (which had zero fillable fields). The layout follows a logical flow: patient demographics → sending/receiving provider → purpose → date range → record types → sensitive categories → attestation → signature. The two-column sender/recipient layout is efficient, and the form includes 12 record-type checkboxes plus an "Abstract Record" shortcut (last year of encounters and results).

The language is a mix of standard HIPAA authorization phrasing and reasonably clear instructions. While not truly plain-language, it is accessible to most adults. One notable defect: the PDF contains a duplicated/garbled heading ("Select from thethe following...") — a layout error. The fillable fields also lack accessible names, which would impact screen reader users.

The Spanish version (form-3) is a high-quality professional translation with fillable fields, though it lacks the email delivery option present in the English form — a functional parity gap.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **No in-person submission requirement** — mail, email, and online (ShareCare) are available.
- **No fees disclosed** on the form — neither good nor bad, but not transparent.
- **No SSN field** on the current form (the legacy form-1 did collect SSN — a red flag that was corrected).
- **90-day default expiration** is shorter than the industry-typical 6 months, potentially requiring re-authorization if processing is slow.
- **30-day response timeline** is clearly stated, correctly reflecting HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering a professionally translated Spanish form alongside English is uncommon and valuable, especially in a Northeast practice.
- **"Abstract Record" option**: Provides a practical shortcut for patients who want a summary without selecting individual record types.
- **Reference Guide**: Page 2 defines sensitive information categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, reproductive services) in plain language with NJ law citations.
- **Email delivery option**: Explicitly offers electronic delivery alongside mail.
- **Online submission via ShareCare**: Provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Overall Assessment

Advocare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an independent physician practice. Forms are easy to find, fillable, available in two languages, and offer electronic submission. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must navigate a general-purpose authorization form designed around third-party disclosure. The "Patient Request" checkbox partially addresses this, but the form's structure still assumes a sender-to-recipient model that doesn't map cleanly to individual access rights. This is a solid B-level performance: competent, accessible, and showing genuine attention to patient needs, with room for improvement in truly centering the patient access experience.

# St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Phoenix, AZ, offers a notably differentiated approach to medical records access. The organization maintains separate forms for patient self-access (form-2.pdf) and third-party release (form-3.pdf), with its medical records webpage clearly distinguishing between the two pathways. This separation is a meaningful patient-centeredness achievement that many organizations fail to provide.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" (X-MR-4869, dated 02/22) — a 5-page dedicated patient access form linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" option. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
- **form-3.pdf**: A 2-page third-party authorization form (X-MR-4862, dated 03/13) — an image-only scan used for releasing records to physicians or other parties.
- **form-1.pdf**: A general Arizona Dignity Health authorization form found via web search but not linked from the St. Joseph's page. It references Mercy Gilbert Medical Center and appears to be from a different facility.

The medical records page also references an online Patient Center/Patient Portal as an alternative access channel (Section D of form-2).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating approximately 4–5 clicks through the Dignity Health website (Home → Arizona → St. Joseph's → Patients and Visitors → For Patients → Medical Records). The path is logical and well-structured, though it requires traversing the multi-facility health system hierarchy. The medical records page clearly separates patient self-request from third-party authorization — a helpful distinction that reduces confusion at the point of access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

St. Joseph's stands out for maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** that is clearly distinct from its third-party release authorization. Form-2 is explicitly titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and covers only patient self-access, while form-3 handles third-party disclosures. This organizational separation reflects genuine awareness of the difference between HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) and authorization for disclosure (§ 164.508).

However, the execution has some issues. The form's processing language states the hospital will "contact you with either denial or acceptance of the request" — framing patient access as discretionary rather than as a right that must be fulfilled within 30 days. Additionally, the employee verification block on page 4 (fields for "ID Presented" and staff verification) implies in-person presentation may be expected, even though email and fax submission are explicitly offered.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is digitally typeset with a clean text layer but contains **zero fillable form fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The form is organized into five lettered sections (A through E) with a logical progression: access type → delivery format → record types → patient portal → directing records to others. This structure is clear and well-conceived.

The form offers unusually comprehensive delivery options: USB drive, CD, secure email, unsecured email, and paper. Submission can be done via email (DignityHealth-AZ-ROI@DignityHealth.org) or fax (two numbers provided), eliminating the need for physical visits. Record type granularity is excellent, with 14+ specific categories plus a "Complete Health Record" option.

The main content design weaknesses are the routing complexity on page 1 — six different email addresses and three fax numbers for different departments, requiring patients to determine which contact handles their request — and the multi-state sensitive records sections (Arizona, California, and Nevada), which add confusion for patients at an Arizona facility. At 5 pages (4 patient-facing plus a facility-only denial page), the form is moderately long but justified by the breadth of options.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. Submission is available via email and fax, so no in-person visit is necessary. Fees are mentioned ("Fees may apply. See attached price list") but the referenced price list is not included in the PDF, leaving patients unable to assess costs upfront. No specific response time or turnaround commitment is stated. A Spanish version of the form is available, which is a positive accessibility feature for the Phoenix market.

## Overall Assessment

St. Joseph's earns credit for the structural decision to maintain a dedicated patient access form — a practice that most organizations do not follow. The form offers genuine patient choice in record types and delivery formats. However, the lack of fillable fields, complex routing instructions, discretionary "acceptance" language, and missing fee schedule prevent the experience from reaching its potential. The result is an organization that has the right framework but falls short in execution, landing at a **C grade (3.40)** that reflects adequate but improvable service to patients requesting their own records.

# Pocahontas Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Pocahontas Memorial Hospital (PMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Buckeye, West Virginia. Two PDF forms were found on the hospital's Medical Records page: a general-purpose **Authorization for Release of Medical Information** (form-1, 2 pages) and a narrowly scoped **COVID-19 Testing Authorization** (form-2, 1 page). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own records; form-2 is a pandemic-era authorization for releasing COVID test results to employers or schools.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Form

PMH does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole route for a patient requesting their own records is the generic HIPAA authorization form (form-1), which is designed to handle all release scenarios — personal use, insurance, attorneys, and other third parties. The form does include "Personal use" as the first option under Purpose of Disclosure, and a patient can name themselves as the recipient, but the overall structure (recipient fields, entity authorization, third-party delivery options) is oriented toward release to others. There is no separate patient access request form, online portal, or patient portal–based request workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A general web search for PMH authorization forms returned generic template sites rather than the hospital's own link. A site-scoped search (`site:pmhwv.org`) succeeded, and the form is linked from a logical location: Patients and Visitors > Medical Records. Bot protection on the website blocked direct programmatic (curl) downloads, requiring a browser-based workaround. A patient navigating the website directly would find the form in 2–3 clicks, which is reasonable for a small facility.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring the patient to print and handwrite. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, record type selection (about 10 checkbox options), date range, sensitive information opt-outs, purpose of disclosure, recipient information, and delivery preferences. The logical flow is sensible: patient info → what to release → purpose → recipient → delivery → authorization → signature.

Layout is functional but minimal. There are no bold section headers, boxed regions, or strong visual hierarchy beyond the document title and some capitalized labels. The sensitive information opt-out section is a dense paragraph with inline initial-lines that could be difficult to parse. Language is a mix of plain phrasing and standard legal boilerplate; the authorization paragraph on page 2 is a single dense block. A notable text encoding defect drops the "ti" ligature throughout the PDF (rendering "Patient" as "Pa ent," "authorization" as "authoriza on," etc.), which breaks screen readers and text search — a significant accessibility flaw.

## Submission Methods & Delivery Options

The form offers multiple submission and delivery options: in-person pickup (self or authorized representative), US Mail, fax (304-799-2276), and email. Format options explicitly include Paper and Electronic (email, USB, CD, Portal, other). This is a notably comprehensive set of electronic delivery options for a small critical access hospital. Since fax is available, a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Compliance

**No notarization required** — only a patient signature. The form includes a clear **non-conditioning statement** ("may not condition its providing of health care on whether copies... are released"), an unusual and commendable inclusion for a small rural facility. A **30-day response time** is stated, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Revocation and re-disclosure language are present and standard.

However, the form states **"Photo ID is required"** as a blanket requirement without clarifying whether this applies only to in-person pickup or also to mailed/faxed requests — a potential barrier for remote patients. **Fee disclosure is vague**: "All other requestors are charged as state and federal laws allow" provides no specific amounts, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. These are not dealbreakers but reflect areas where the form could better serve patients.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Electronic format options explicitly listed (email, USB, CD, Portal); multiple delivery methods; non-conditioning statement included; 30-day response time stated; logical form flow.

**Red flags**: Zero fillable fields despite being digitally created; blanket photo ID requirement; vague fee disclosure; systematic text encoding defect affecting accessibility; "Snowshoe Mountain Clinic" listed as a record type alongside clinical categories (confusing).

## Overall Assessment

PMH provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of a small independent critical access hospital. The form is findable, logically organized, and offers commendable delivery flexibility. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, zero fillable fields, and several barrier concerns prevent it from rising above average. The form adequately serves a patient who knows what they need, but it wasn't designed with the patient self-access use case as a priority.

# Rhode Island Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rhode Island Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Providence, RI, is part of the Brown University Health system (formerly Lifespan). Two PDF forms were retrieved: a system-wide "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" form (form-1, updated October 2024) and a department-specific imaging-records release form (form-2, Lifespan Medical Imaging, revised February 2023). Form-1 is the primary form relevant to a patient requesting their own records from Rhode Island Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Rhode Island Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both retrieved forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. The primary form (form-1) frames the workflow around disclosing records *to* a named recipient ("To release to:"), which is the structure of a third-party authorization — not a patient self-access request. While the form does include "Patient Request" as a purpose checkbox (Section 4), a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in their own name as both the patient and the recipient. There is no separate form, section, or process that recognizes individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 as distinct from authorized disclosure to third parties.

The hospital does maintain a dedicated medical records request webpage at `brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records` with contact information, which is a helpful navigation aid. However, this page directs patients to the same generic authorization form rather than offering a simplified patient-access workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the primary form, and a site-specific search confirmed the URL and identified the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or other access barriers were encountered. The PDF was directly downloadable from a public URL. This is a strong point — many organizations make form discovery far more difficult.

## Form Document Quality

**Fillability**: The primary form is a born-digital PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being a recently updated document (October 2024), patients must print it and complete all fields by hand. This is a missed opportunity given the form's digital origin — adding interactive fields would be trivial.

**Layout and organization**: Form-1 uses a logical 11-section numbered structure covering facility selection, recipient, dates, purpose, format, record types, exclusions, and legal terms — all compressed onto a single page. The structure is clear, but the density is high, with legal boilerplate competing for space with patient-facing fields.

**Language**: The legal sections (8–11) use standard but dense regulatory language. No plain-language summary, explanatory guidance, or patient-friendly instructions are provided. A patient without familiarity with HIPAA authorization forms would likely find the legal sections intimidating.

**Record format options**: Limited to "paper" or "CD disc" — no electronic delivery option (email, portal, secure link) is offered. This is notable for a 2024 form, especially given HIPAA's requirement to provide records in the electronic format requested if readily producible.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Broad liability waiver**: Section 9 requires patients to "release Brown University Health, its employees and my physicians from all liability arising from this disclosure of my health information." Bundling a blanket liability release into a records authorization is aggressive and may discourage patients from exercising their access rights.
- **Vague fee language**: The form notes "There may be a fee associated with this request" without specifying amounts, providing a fee schedule, or distinguishing between patient-access fees (HIPAA-capped) and third-party release fees.
- **No electronic delivery**: Offering only paper and CD in 2024 creates a barrier for patients seeking digital access.
- **Out-of-state contact numbers**: Status inquiry numbers route to Massachusetts and California area codes, suggesting outsourced ROI processing — potentially confusing for Providence-based patients.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record-type selection**: ~10 specific record categories plus a behavioral health subsection, with a helpful "Abstract" definition footnote, give patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.
- **Sensitive information protections**: Five categories of sensitive information (sexual abuse, mental health, STIs, substance use, HIV) can be excluded, respecting both 42 CFR Part 2 and Rhode Island state law.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: A single form covers all Brown University Health facilities with clear checkboxes, avoiding the need to locate separate forms.
- **Easy findability**: Forms are prominently available online with no access barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Rhode Island Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and logically organized, but it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual access rights — through a generic third-party authorization workflow. The absence of fillable fields, electronic delivery options, and a patient-access-specific pathway places it squarely in the middle of the pack. The embedded liability waiver and vague fee language are concerning, though the granular record-type options and sensitive-information protections are commendable. A patient can successfully request records, but the process was clearly designed for institutional disclosure workflows rather than patient self-service.

# SSM Health DePaul Hospital - St. Louis: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health DePaul Hospital in Bridgeton, MO is part of the SSM Health system, a major nonprofit health system operating across the Midwest. The hospital does not maintain its own medical records request forms; instead, it relies on SSM Health's system-wide forms. Two versions were found: an older system-wide form (form-1, "SSMHC" branding, dated 1/2019) and a current St. Louis metro–specific form (form-2, "SSM Health" branding). Form-2 is the applicable document for DePaul Hospital patients. Additionally, SSM Health's medical records page references an electronic request option through the **MRO Express portal** (mroexpress.mrocorp.com) for Missouri facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Both forms are dual-purpose documents titled "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," combining individual access requests and third-party disclosure authorizations into a single instrument. A patient requesting their own records must navigate structure designed for third-party releases — including a "disclose my protected health information to" recipient block with name, address, fax, and relationship fields. The "For personal access" option exists only as a checkbox buried under the "Purpose of Disclosure" section, alongside options like "Insurance/Workers' Compensation" and "Legal."

This dual-purpose design means patients must determine which fields to fill, which to skip, and how to route a form that assumes a releasing-to and releasing-from party. While technically functional, it is not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required moderate effort. The SSM Health medical records page (ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records) uses location-dependent content loading to surface region-specific forms, but the location selector's autocomplete reportedly failed during testing. Starting from DePaul Hospital's location page, the "Get Medical Records" link redirects to the system-wide page without directly linking the St. Louis metro form. A web search for SSM Health medical records forms did surface both PDFs, and the form-2 URL is descriptively structured. Overall, a patient would need 3+ clicks and some navigation persistence.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 — the relevant document — is a **single-page fillable PDF with 69 interactive fields**, representing a genuine digital-first design. Patients can complete the entire form electronically in any PDF viewer without printing. This is a clear strength. The form includes fields for patient demographics, type of access (inspection, hard copy, electronic copy), record type checkboxes with date fields (including sensitive categories like substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV-related information), purpose of disclosure, and a seven-item acknowledgement section covering HIPAA rights.

However, the language is **legalistic** throughout. The acknowledgement section contains seven dense paragraphs written in formal legal register. There are no separate instructions, no plain-language summary, and no guidance helping patients understand which fields apply to their situation. The single-page constraint results in compressed formatting and small text in the acknowledgement section. The form is English-only.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and **no in-person submission mandate**. Fees are disclosed as possible ("I may be required to pay the cost of creating paper copies or electronic media") but without specific amounts and with a TPO exception carve-out. A 30-day response time is committed, and the right to request review of access denials is clearly stated. Revocation rights and non-conditioning of care are explicitly covered.

The most notable concern is the **email delivery warning**: SSM Health states that encrypted email is "the only way to avoid third party interception" and frames unencrypted email delivery as a risky exception requiring patient acknowledgement. While email delivery is technically offered (form-2 includes an email field), the discouraging language may deter patients from choosing electronic delivery. An expiration date field — with research-oriented options — is misplaced for patient access requests and may confuse non-research requestors.

## Notable Strengths

- **69 fillable form fields** on a single page — genuinely fillable, not a flat scan
- **Email delivery option** with explicit email address field (form-2 improvement over form-1)
- **Granular record type selection** with sensitive-category breakouts for substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV
- **MRO Express portal** as an alternative electronic request pathway
- **Clear rights statements** covering 30-day timeline, denial review, and revocation

## Key Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as insurance companies and attorneys
- **Legalistic language** with no plain-language guidance or instructions
- **Email delivery framed as risky exception** rather than standard option
- **English-only** — no multilingual support
- **Expiration date field** inappropriate for patient access requests

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health DePaul Hospital earns a **C grade**. The fillable PDF form and MRO Express portal provide adequate technical infrastructure, and the form covers HIPAA compliance basics without imposing illegitimate barriers. However, the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, combined with dense legal language and no patient-facing guidance, means a patient must work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights. The org meets minimum requirements but falls short of patient-centered design.

# Lexington Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lexington Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Lexington, Kentucky. Two ROI authorization forms were found on their website: a current 2024 version (form-1) co-branded with VitalChart, a third-party ROI processing vendor, and a legacy 2014 version (form-2) that remains publicly accessible but appears to be superseded. The 2024 form is the actively linked version on the Patient Forms page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

Lexington Clinic does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release" documents designed to serve all disclosure purposes — patient self-access, transfer of care, legal requests, and other third-party releases. However, form-1 includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Purpose of Disclosure," which effectively signals a Right of Access request even though the form never explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 or uses the term "Right of Access."

The organization funnels all records requests through VitalChart, which processes the authorization and fulfills the request. This vendor-mediated model means the patient completes a single generic authorization form and sends it to VitalChart rather than directly to Lexington Clinic's HIM department. No online portal or digital request wizard is available.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A straightforward web search returned direct PDF download links on the first attempt. The Patient Forms page at lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that the legacy 2014 form (form-2) remains publicly indexed and discoverable via search engines, with no version labeling or "superseded" notice — creating a risk that patients might find and use the outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally composed PDF with a clear text layer but **zero fillable fields** — a significant missed opportunity given its digital origin. A patient must print it, fill it by hand, and then submit it via mail, fax, or email to VitalChart. The layout is well-organized with six numbered sections following a logical "who → where → what → why → cost → sign" flow. Section headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are unusually conversational and patient-friendly for a medical-legal form. However, the legal disclosures in Section 6 shift to dense HIPAA boilerplate, and fitting everything onto one page makes the form somewhat dense.

Record-type granularity is good: patients can select specific providers, date ranges, conditions, and record subtypes (labs, radiology, office notes, immunizations, operative reports). Delivery options include mail, email, and fax (fax restricted to healthcare providers only). Email delivery to patients is a meaningful positive — many organizations offer only mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fee structure**: The form cites KRS 422.317, stating the first copy is free, with additional copies at $1.00 per page. While the first-copy-free provision is patient-friendly, the $1.00/page charge for subsequent copies may exceed HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based fee" limit for Right of Access requests. A $5.00 late fee and "non-refundable once services are rendered" language add financial friction not contemplated by HIPAA's access provisions.

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is not a HIPAA requirement for ROI authorization and raises privacy concerns.

**Submission ambiguity**: While VitalChart's mailing address, phone, fax, and email are listed at the bottom, the form never explicitly instructs patients on how to submit the completed authorization. A patient may be unsure whether they can email the completed form.

**No notarization or witness required** — a positive. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- First copy free with clear Kentucky statutory citation
- Email delivery available to patients (not just providers)
- Conversational, patient-friendly section headers
- Good record-type granularity enabling targeted requests
- Single-page, concise format
- Easy online findability

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Clinic provides a reasonably accessible records request process that clears several important bars: the form is easy to find, well-organized, and can be submitted electronically via fax or email to VitalChart. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization form design (no dedicated patient access pathway), and the potentially non-compliant fee structure for patient access requests hold it back from a higher rating. The organization's approach is typical of mid-sized independent practices that outsource ROI processing to a vendor — functional but not patient-centered.

# WakeMed Health & Hospitals — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

WakeMed Health & Hospitals provides a single ROI authorization form ("Authorization to Release Medical Information," N-935, revised 11/25) available in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf, N-935S). These are the same form translated — not separate documents for different purposes. Both are linked from the Health Information Management (HIM) page under Patients and Visitors → Medical Records. There is no online portal, no web-based request wizard, and no dedicated patient-access form. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it by hand, and submitting via email (HIMROI@Wakemed.org), fax (919-350-1720), or mail.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

WakeMed does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization that covers both releasing and obtaining PHI. A patient requesting their own records selects "Personal" from a list of five purposes (Billing/Insurance, Patient Care, Personal, Legal, Other) and must fill in a "Recipient" field — a concept that doesn't map cleanly when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form asks for the name of the "Person, Organization, or Facility you want us to release your PHI to," which creates an awkward fit for a simple "send me my records" request. This is a generic_hipaa_auth pathway, not a patient-centric design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A web search for WakeMed's ROI authorization immediately surfaced the correct page. The only friction was that an older URL (/assets/documents/...) was stale and returned HTML, requiring navigation to the HIM page to locate the current PDF links under /sites/default/files/pdf/. Once there, both language versions are clearly labeled and downloadable without bot blocking or access restrictions. Difficulty: moderate — easy via search, but required one redirect.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. Checkboxes are rendered as the letter "o" in text, and blanks are underscores — a purely print-and-handwrite design. The form has a text layer (not an image scan), so the content is readable on screen, but a patient cannot complete it digitally without third-party annotation tools.

Layout and organization are strong points. The 2-page form flows logically: patient/recipient information → record types and date ranges → format and delivery preferences (page 1), then understanding/consent → authorization/signature → revocation → contact information (page 2). Section headers are bold and uppercase. Record type selection is granular, with specific options for office visits, hospital admissions, ED visits, imaging studies, and sub-components like discharge summaries and lab reports. The date-of-visit field is flexibly worded ("Specify the date, date range, or other specific description of your visit").

Language is reasonably plain, though the UNDERSTANDING section on page 2 leans toward legal formality with a series of "I understand..." statements. These are necessary disclosures (re-disclosure risk, revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment) but add density.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No unnecessary barriers**: No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission. Multiple electronic submission channels (email and fax). Identity verification is mentioned but framed permissively ("proof of my identity... may be requested").

**Fee disclosure is vague**: The form warns that "any and/or all" requests and large-volume requests are processed by WakeMed's copy service and "a fee will be charged," but provides no schedule, estimate, or reference to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based standard. A patient cannot predict costs before submitting.

**Notable bright spots**: (1) A Spanish-language version exists — uncommon in this study — though it has translation gaps, with key field labels ("Address where you want your PHI sent to," "Email address") remaining in English. (2) Six delivery methods are offered: mail, fax, pick up, onsite review, MyChart (for records after 2/1/2015), and email with encrypted delivery as the default. (3) Email submission of the form itself removes a significant access barrier. (4) The form was recently revised (11/25), suggesting active maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

WakeMed provides a competent, well-organized ROI form with multiple submission and delivery channels, a Spanish translation, and no major procedural barriers. Its primary weakness is the lack of a patient-centric access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization form designed for all disclosure purposes, and the non-fillable PDF format forces a print-and-handwrite workflow. The form is adequate for its purpose but falls short of best practice in digital accessibility and patient-centeredness. Grade: **B** (3.50).

# UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, part of the UCHealth system in Aurora, Colorado, provides a solid pathway for patients requesting their own medical records. The organization's medical records page is well-organized, directly links to the current authorization form, and offers an online request portal (MRO Express) as an alternative. Four PDFs were downloaded during retrieval, but only two are genuinely relevant: the current system-wide authorization form (form-4) and an older 2017-era predecessor (form-1). A third form (form-2) is a legacy inter-facility transfer document, and the fourth (form-3) belongs to an entirely different organization — UC Health Cincinnati — retrieved due to domain confusion between uchealth.org (Colorado) and uchealth.com (Cincinnati).

## Access Pathway: Generic Form with Strong Patient Accommodation

UCHealth does not offer a dedicated patient-access-only form. The current form (form-4, document #HIM19000.1025, revised October 2025) is a generic "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it accommodates patient self-access unusually well. The form includes an explicit "If released to self, select method of release" section with four delivery options: email, My Health Connection (patient portal), mail, and PowerShare (for radiology images). The fee schedule is split clearly between patient access (free via portal, free paper up to 100 pages, first radiology disc free) and third-party recipients (retrieval fee plus per-page charges). This dual fee structure is a standout practice — few organizations make this distinction so transparently on the form itself.

The organization also offers MRO Express, an online request portal, as an alternative to the downloadable PDF. This portal provides a fully digital pathway, though our evaluation focused on the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. UCHealth's medical records page (`uchealth.org/access-my-health-connection/medical-records-uchealth/`) was reachable within 1–2 clicks from the main website and clearly presented the download link, online portal option, and location-specific contact information. The only complication was domain confusion: a web search returned a form from UC Health Cincinnati (uchealth.com), which could mislead patients searching generically for "UCHealth" forms. Two older forms (2017 and 2018 vintages) also remain publicly hosted at their original URLs with no indication they are superseded, creating a minor stale-link hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4) is a single-page, digitally generated PDF with a clean text layer — not a scan. Despite its digital-native construction, it has **zero fillable form fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. This is a notable gap: the older form-2 (a legacy inter-facility document) actually had 54 fillable fields, demonstrating that UCHealth has the technical capacity for interactive PDFs but did not apply it to the current form.

The layout is logical — flowing from facility selection through patient demographics, purpose, recipient, date range, record types, disclosures, fees, and signature — but extremely dense. Approximately 28 record-type checkboxes, a full fee schedule, six numbered disclosure statements, a reproductive healthcare warning, and a confidentiality notice are all compressed onto a single page. The form helpfully defines "Visit record" vs. "Visit summary" in parenthetical notes, aiding patient comprehension. Language across the disclosures is plain and accessible, covering right to revoke, voluntary nature, no conditioning on treatment, and re-disclosure risks. The form does not include submission instructions (no address, fax number, or email for where to send it), though this information is presumably on the medical records web page.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

UCHealth imposes no significant barriers: no notarization, no SSN request (a problem on the older form-2, now corrected), no mandatory in-person submission, and no conditioning of treatment on signing. The patient fee structure — free portal delivery and free paper up to 100 pages — is among the most generous observed. A notable bright spot is the reproductive healthcare warning (item 6), alerting patients that released reproductive health information could be used in litigation — a post-*Dobbs* addition reflecting emerging privacy concerns. Sensitive record categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, genetic, sickle cell, reproductive health) each require separate patient consent, providing granular control.

The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (requiring print-and-fill), the absence of submission instructions on the form itself, and the failure to state a processing time commitment (the older form-1 promised 10 business days). The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Overall Assessment

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital earns a solid **B** grade. The organization makes its form easy to find, provides an online portal alternative, clearly accommodates patient self-access with separate delivery options and fee structures, and maintains strong compliance posture. The main shortcomings are the non-fillable PDF format and the dense single-page design. With fillable fields and submission instructions added to the form, this would approach best-in-class.

# Myrtue Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Myrtue Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Harlan, Iowa. The organization posts its medical records forms on a dedicated "Authorization + Release Forms" page under the Patients + Visitors section of its website. Two English-language forms were retrieved, along with references to their Spanish translations:

- **form-1.pdf** — "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (the primary ROI form)
- **form-2.pdf** — "Consent for Disclosure" (permission for verbal communication with designated individuals)

Form-1 is the document a patient would use to request copies of their own medical records. Form-2 serves a different purpose — authorizing the facility to discuss a patient's care by phone with family members or caregivers — and is not relevant to the patient self-access use case.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

Myrtue Medical Center does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party seeking authorization for release. Form-1 is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form with a bidirectional "From / To" layout. A patient requesting their own records must check Myrtue in the "From" column and write their own name and address in the "To" column's "Other" field. This works, but the form was clearly designed with third-party release as the primary use case — there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no streamlined self-request pathway, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A site-scoped web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's website provides a clearly labeled forms page reachable within two clicks from the homepage. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or login requirements were encountered. The PDF filenames are descriptive and include language and revision date. The form header includes complete HIM department contact information (phone, fax, and email), giving patients clear channels for questions and submission.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally designed PDF — concise and logically organized with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, from/to routing, record type selection, purpose, delivery method, legal disclosures, and signature. The language is mostly plain, with formal phrasing limited to the legal disclosures at the bottom. Record type options are granular, with appropriate handling of substance use disorder records under 42 CFR Part 2.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being designed in publishing software with 10 fonts and an embedded logo. All checkboxes and text blanks are static graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a missed opportunity — the June 2025 revision could have added interactive form elements with minimal effort.

## Submission and Delivery Options

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: MyChart Portal, mail, encrypted email, and in-person pickup. The inclusion of MyChart Portal and encrypted email is a genuine bright spot for a small rural facility. For form submission, the header lists fax (712-755-2640) and email (medicalrecords@myrtuemedical.org), meaning a patient can submit the completed form electronically. This meets the baseline for adequate electronic access.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required — only the patient or authorized representative signature. Fees are disclosed as subject to "reproduction fees in accordance with federal/state regulations," but no specific amounts are provided, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. The form includes required HIPAA authorization disclosures: right to revoke, no-conditioning statement, re-disclosure warning, and a one-year maximum expiration. However, because the form frames patient access as a § 164.508 authorization rather than a § 164.524 access request, patients may not understand that different fee rules and timelines apply to their own records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish translations available** for both forms — commendable for a small rural Iowa facility
- **MyChart Portal and encrypted email** as delivery options signal a digital-forward approach
- **Substance use disorder carve-out** with 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language reflects careful compliance
- **Recent revision** (June 2025) suggests active form maintenance
- **Single-page design** minimizes patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Myrtue Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with some genuinely progressive features (portal delivery, encrypted email, bilingual availability). However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing place it squarely in the middle tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# WellSpan York Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

WellSpan York Hospital is part of WellSpan Health, a regional nonprofit health system in Pennsylvania. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms at the system level on wellspan.org. **Form-1.pdf** ("Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information," Form #2606, Rev. 08/25) is the primary system-wide form applicable to York Hospital and all other WellSpan facilities. **Form-2.pdf** ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information") is scoped exclusively to three WellSpan neighborhood hospitals (Newberry, Shrewsbury, Carlisle) and does not apply to York Hospital. The assessment below focuses on form-1.pdf as the relevant patient pathway.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WellSpan does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form or pathway distinct from third-party release. Form-1.pdf is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization with a bidirectional "Obtain from" / "Disclose to" structure designed for third-party transfers. However, the form does include a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an unusually clear statement of the right to self-access: *"I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."* This language partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated pathway, but a patient must still navigate a form framed around releasing records to another party and figure out how to adapt it for self-access (e.g., writing their own name in the "Disclose to" field).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A straightforward web search immediately returned a direct PDF link on wellspan.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. Multiple search strategies all converged on the same document. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1.pdf is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a complete text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally created, all fields are blank underscored lines, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient identification flows into record source/destination, then record type selection, purpose, delivery format, sensitive-records disclosure, legal terms, signatures, and submission instructions. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records paragraph on page 1 is a dense run-on sentence that could benefit from formatting improvements.

Record type options are well structured with five top-level categories (Abstract with detailed sub-list, Diagnostic Test Results, Imaging, Billing, and Complete record). Delivery format options are a standout feature: patients can choose Paper, CD, Fax, or Email, where the email option delivers records through a secure portal as PDFs available for 30 days.

## Barriers & Compliance

The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's SSN — an unnecessary data collection practice that introduces privacy risk without being required for patient identification. A witness signature line on page 2 creates ambiguity about whether a witness is routinely required or only for specific circumstances. Fees are mentioned as "regulated by state and federal law" but no specific amounts are disclosed. Notably, form processing is handled by MRO Corporation, a third-party ROI vendor, meaning patients interact with MRO rather than WellSpan directly.

On the positive side: the form explicitly accepts copies in lieu of originals, does not require notarization, and clearly states that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing. The 12-month authorization window is reasonable.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit the completed form via **fax** (717-812-8119), **email** (PatientRequests@wellspan.org), or **mail** to the York, PA HIM office. The availability of fax and email means patients are not required to physically visit the facility or rely solely on postal mail.

## Overall Assessment

WellSpan York Hospital provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed authorization form with modern delivery options (secure portal) and explicit right-to-self language. However, the absence of fillable fields in a born-digital PDF, the generic third-party authorization structure, the SSN collection, and witness ambiguity prevent it from reaching the top tier. The organization serves patients adequately but has clear room for improvement in both digital accessibility and patient-centered design.

# Mercy General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy General Hospital, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Sacramento, CA, provides patients with a reasonably accessible but structurally fragmented records request process. Three forms were found: a general third-party authorization (form-1), a medical group patient access form (form-2), and a hospital patient access form (form-3). The organization correctly separates patient self-access from third-party release — a meaningful positive — but splits patient access across two entities (hospital vs. medical group), requiring patients to navigate dual tracks.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mercy General Hospital does differentiate individual access from third-party release. Both form-2 and form-3 are titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and explicitly state they will not result in disclosure to anyone other than the patient or their representative. The third-party authorization (form-1) is a clearly separate document. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations funnel all requests through a single generic HIPAA authorization form.

However, the dual-track structure (hospital form vs. medical group form) creates confusion. A patient who received both inpatient and outpatient care at Mercy General would need to submit two different forms to two different departments. The website does not provide clear guidance on which form to use, and the hospital vs. medical group distinction is opaque to most patients.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. All three were accessible via web search and linked from the Dignity Health Sacramento medical records page. One URL from search results returned a 404, suggesting some form reorganization over time, but current links worked. The forms' filenames are reasonably descriptive. Contact information (phone, fax, email) is provided on the medical group form, making it easy for patients to ask questions.

## Form Document Quality

The primary hospital patient access form (form-3) is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a significant gap, especially since the companion third-party authorization (form-1) has 42 fillable fields, demonstrating the organization has the capability to produce interactive PDFs. The medical group form (form-2) also has zero fillable fields. Both patient access forms are print-and-fill documents that were designed for in-person clinical workflows and posted online as an afterthought.

Form-3's text layer suffers from severe font encoding corruption — extracted text contains garbled characters (e.g., "3DWLHQW ,GHQWL¿FDWLRQ" for "Patient Identification"), which likely renders the form inaccessible to screen readers.

The layout of both patient access forms is logical with lettered sections, clear record-type checkboxes, and multiple delivery format options (Paper, USB Drive, CD, Secure Email, Unsecured Email for form-3; mail, pickup, email, flash drive, fax for form-2). Language is mostly plain, though some legalistic phrasing appears in the sensitive records sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flags relate to physician gatekeeping of patient access:

- **Physician veto mechanism**: Form-3 includes a "NOTIFICATION TO DOCTOR" section that actively solicits physician objections to releasing records, without informing the patient of their right to appeal a denial.
- **Physician approval for HIV and psychiatric records**: Both patient access forms require physician/caregiver approval before releasing HIV test results or psychiatric records to the patient — a requirement that likely conflicts with HIPAA's right of access, which generally does not condition patient access on provider approval.
- **ID verification contradiction**: Form-2 demands "PICTURE I.D. MUST BE PRESENTED" while simultaneously offering mail, email, and fax submission — contradictory requirements.

Fee disclosure is vague on both forms ("fees may apply") without specifying amounts. Form-3 references an "attached price list" that is not included in the PDF. Neither form states a response timeline, and neither includes a patient rights section (unlike the third-party authorization form, which does).

## Strengths

- Clear separation of patient access from third-party release, with explicit cross-references between forms
- Multiple electronic delivery options including USB drive, CD, secure and unsecured email
- Inspect-only option on form-2 (no copying fees)
- Direct contact information (phone, fax, email) prominently displayed
- Multi-facility coverage across six Dignity Health Sacramento hospitals

## Overall Assessment

Mercy General Hospital demonstrates good intent in creating dedicated patient access forms separate from third-party authorizations, and offers genuinely flexible delivery options. However, the execution falls short: non-fillable PDFs, encoding accessibility issues, physician gatekeeping provisions, and a confusing dual-track structure undermine patient-centeredness. The organization invests more technical effort in the third-party release form (42 fillable fields) than in its patient access forms (zero fillable fields each), suggesting that patient self-access is not the priority workflow. A patient can ultimately navigate the process, but must contend with printing forms, unclear fee structures, and potentially inappropriate physician approval requirements.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

MUSC Health provides five documents related to medical records release: the current English authorization form (form-1, Rev. 10/2023, 2 pages), an older superseded version (form-2, Version 11, dated 11/2017), a dental-specific variant (form-3, Version 9, dated 5/2019), a MyChart instructions guide (form-4, 4 pages, dated 2017), and a Spanish translation of the current form (form-5). The primary form for patient self-access is form-1, the current "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information."

Critically, MUSC offers three distinct request pathways clearly presented on its medical records page: (1) MyChart Patient Portal for existing portal users, (2) an online eRequest wizard via Ciox/Swellbox for fully digital submission, and (3) manual form download for traditional mail/fax/email submission. This multi-pathway approach gives patients genuine flexibility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MUSC does differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — but at the process level, not the form level. The MyChart instructions document (form-4) explicitly states that MyChart is for patient self-requests, while the HIPAA authorization form should be used "for medical records to be sent directly to a physician office, hospital or third parties." The medical records webpage reinforces this distinction through its tabbed layout.

However, the downloadable PDF form itself (form-1) is a generic HIPAA authorization serving all purposes. "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" is listed as one purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care," "Legal," "Insurance," and others. The form does not distinguish the legal basis, fee structure, or processing rules for patient access under 45 CFR §164.524 versus third-party authorization — even though it cites that regulation. A patient using only the form must navigate a document designed around the third-party release paradigm.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability is excellent. The medical records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and all three pathways are clearly presented. Web searches for MUSC records release forms return direct PDF links. No bot-blocking or access difficulties were encountered. The form URLs are descriptive and intuitive. Both English and Spanish versions are co-located under a clearly labeled section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-authored, text-layered PDF with clean layout and logical flow: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Record Types → SUD Records → Purpose → Date Range → Release Method → Authorization/Consent → Signature. At two pages, the length is appropriate — page one handles all authorization substance, page two provides a useful facility contact directory for nine MUSC Health locations across South Carolina.

The most significant technical shortcoming is that the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being revised in October 2023. Patients must print the PDF and handwrite all entries, then fax, scan-and-email, or mail the completed form. This is a missed opportunity for a major academic medical center's current-revision document.

Record type options are granular and well-designed, including a dedicated Substance Use Disorder section with proper 42 CFR Part 2 citation and opt-in choices. Delivery options include mail, MyChart, fax, and encrypted email. However, the encrypted email option creates confusion: the checkbox says "Encrypted E-mail" but the accompanying consent language warns about "unencrypted e-mail" risks, leaving patients uncertain about what they're authorizing.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — not required by HIPAA — paired with a header warning that "FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION." Together, these could prevent a patient completing the form at home without a witness from submitting it.

Fee language references only South Carolina law ("fees may be charged as provided by S.C. Law") without acknowledging HIPAA's more restrictive cost-based fee limits for patient self-access requests. The MyChart instructions document goes further, stating a blanket fee "for all patient requests" with a prepayment requirement and no disclosed amounts — a notable compliance concern.

The form requires attaching a copy of photo identification, which is reasonable but adds friction for remote submission.

## Strengths

MUSC's standout features include: a **Spanish-language form** that faithfully mirrors the current English version with professional translation quality; **three clearly presented request pathways** including a fully digital portal option (Ciox/Swellbox); a **comprehensive nine-location facility directory** with fax numbers, phone numbers, and dedicated ROI email addresses; **granular SUD records consent** with correct 42 CFR Part 2 citation; and an **explicit citation of 45 CFR §164.524** (patient right of access).

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health demonstrates strong organizational infrastructure for records access — excellent findability, multiple pathways, bilingual support, and process-level differentiation between patient and third-party requests. However, the core downloadable form remains a generic authorization that doesn't center patient self-access, the PDF is not fillable despite a 2023 revision, and compliance details around fees and the witness requirement introduce unnecessary friction. The availability of the Ciox/Swellbox portal partially mitigates the form-level weaknesses by offering patients a fully digital alternative. Overall, this is a competent but not exceptional approach from a well-resourced teaching hospital.
