# Batch 3 — Best Practices Showcase

## Standout Organizations

### Valleywise Health Medical Center — Dedicated Patient Access Form
**Phoenix, AZ · Government-owned community hospital · 204 beds**

Valleywise is the only organization in this batch that earned a Level 5 patient-centeredness score, and for good reason: it maintains a **dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information" form (Form 45643)** that is clearly separate from its third-party authorization form (Form 43439). This is the fundamental design choice that most organizations get wrong — conflating patient self-access with third-party release. Valleywise's form is bilingual English/Spanish as a single integrated document, appropriate for Phoenix's demographics. It offers six delivery formats including MyChart, CD, USB, email, fax, and paper, and states a 30-day response timeline. The form also includes email encryption transparency: encrypted delivery is the default, with an informed opt-out option for unencrypted email. The SSN field and lack of fillable PDF fields are weaknesses, but the structural decision to center patient access as a distinct right is what other organizations should emulate.

### Samaritan Health Services (Lebanon Community Hospital) — EHI Export Form and Fee Transparency
**Lebanon, OR · Nonprofit community hospital · Regional system**

Samaritan stands out for two rare innovations. First, it offers a **dedicated "Computer Readable EHI Export Request" form** — a separate document specifically for patients wanting machine-readable health data, available in both English and Spanish. This is exceptionally uncommon and demonstrates genuine 21st Century Cures Act awareness. Second, its fee disclosure is exemplary: the standard authorization form explicitly states **"Initial Patient Request: No Charge"** and **"Continuing Care: No Charge,"** with fees applying only to third-party requests. This three-tier structure gives patients immediate cost certainty — a stark contrast to the vague "there may be a fee" language used by most organizations in this batch. Samaritan also provides bilingual forms across all document types, six delivery format options (including MyChart and email), and email-based form submission.

### Memorial Healthcare System — Trilingual Forms and Fast Processing
**Hollywood, FL · Government-owned regional system · 721 beds**

Memorial Healthcare System provides ROI forms in **English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole** — the only trilingual offering in this batch, reflecting South Florida's linguistic diversity. It also commits to a **two-business-day processing time**, dramatically faster than the HIPAA-allowed 30 days and the best turnaround commitment observed. The form offers five delivery methods including e-Delivery and MyChart. While the form itself is non-fillable and uses generic authorization framing, these community-responsive choices demonstrate that a government-owned hospital can lead on accessibility.

### TriStar Centennial / HCA Healthcare — Technical Form Excellence
**Nashville, TN · For-profit community hospital · HCA system**

The HCA authorization form used at TriStar Centennial is a technical standout: a **single-page PDF with 52 fillable fields** in both English and Spanish, with a lean 170 KB file size. It offers four delivery formats including encrypted email and a forward-looking **USCDI Release Request option** for structured health data interoperability — rare on any ROI form. The SSN field is explicitly marked optional. Combined with Swellbox and MyHealthONE portal alternatives, this represents one of the most technically complete form ecosystems in the batch.

### Owensboro Health — EHI Export with Detailed Explanation
**Owensboro, KY · Independent nonprofit · 477 beds**

Owensboro Health's form includes an **EHI Export option with a detailed explanation** covering all electronic protected health information across the organization and named Community Connect Partners. It offers **seven format options** (Paper, MyChart, EHI Export, Email, Fax, CD, USB) and six delivery methods. A dedicated two-page companion instruction document walks patients through each section in plain language, and a help phone number is provided for assistance — thoughtful touches that address health literacy barriers.

### Wayne County Hospital — Dual Pathways from a 25-Bed CAH
**Monticello, KY · Independent nonprofit critical access hospital · 25 beds**

Wayne County Hospital punches far above its weight. This tiny rural hospital offers both a **downloadable PDF and an online HTML web form** — an exceptional dual-pathway approach for a 25-bed facility. The form prominently states that **"Based on KRS 422.317 a first copy of a patient's record will be provided free"** — on-form fee transparency that larger systems routinely omit. It also offers email as a delivery method, reducing barriers for rural patients who may live far from the facility. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" rather than the typical third-party "Authorization for Release," signaling a patient-access-first orientation.

## Patterns Across This Batch

The strongest differentiator in this batch is whether an organization treats patient self-access as a **distinct right** or merely a checkbox on a third-party release form. Only Valleywise and St. Joseph's (Phoenix) maintain truly separate patient access forms, and only Samaritan offers a dedicated EHI export pathway. Organizations that invested in **bilingual or trilingual forms** (Memorial, TriStar/HCA, Erie, Samaritan, Nevada Health Centers) tended to score higher overall, suggesting that language access correlates with broader patient-centeredness. The most innovative features — EHI Export options, USCDI references, fee transparency — appeared across facility types and sizes, from 25-bed CAHs to major teaching hospitals, suggesting that best practices are driven by organizational intent rather than resources.
