# Labette Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Labette Health is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Parsons, Kansas. It takes a notably digital-first approach to medical records requests: rather than offering a downloadable PDF authorization form, it routes patients to an **online Formstack form** accessible directly from the main website navigation. This places Labette Health ahead of many peers who still rely on print-and-mail PDF workflows.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents were downloaded during the search, but **neither is Labette Health's actual ROI form**:

- **form-1.pdf** — A generic one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" template from PatientPop, hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It does not mention Labette Health anywhere and surfaced only as a misleading search result. It has no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and is missing core HIPAA authorization elements.
- **form-2.pdf** — Labette Health's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), effective November 2021. This is an informational compliance document, not a request mechanism. It does reference the right to inspect and copy records and the right to an electronic copy, but does not link to the actual request form.

The **primary and only pathway** for requesting records is the Formstack online form at `https://labetteheatlh.formstack.com/forms/medical_records_request` (note: the subdomain contains a typo — "labetteheatlh" instead of "labettehealth"). The Contact Us page also mentions visiting the office in person as an alternative.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Labette Health's Formstack form **does differentiate** between patient self-access and third-party release. It includes a "Release direction" field with "to Patient/Self" as an explicit option alongside "Other," and a "Relationship to patient" field that includes "Patient/Self" as the first choice. While it is a single form serving multiple purposes rather than a dedicated patient-only form, the self-access pathway is clearly accommodated — a patient does not need to guess which parts apply to them.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating the website directly; standard web searches returned only the irrelevant PatientPop template. The website blocks simple HTTP fetches (returns 403), necessitating browser-based navigation. However, once on the site, the form is **easy to find**: the main navigation under "Patients & visitors" contains a direct "Medical records request form" link. The Contact Us page also links to it. Overall retrieval difficulty is **moderate** — the form is well-placed on the website but invisible to search engines and requires browser access.

## Form Document Quality

The Formstack form is a strong digital-first implementation:

- **Fully interactive**: All fields are fillable online with no printing required
- **Electronic signature**: Includes a signature pad for digital signing
- **Comprehensive record types**: 15+ specific checkboxes (COVID-19, Abstract, Clinic Note, Discharge Summary, EKG/Stress Test, ER Record, H&P, Lab Results, Operative Report, Radiology CD/Report, Sleep Study, Vaccination History, etc.)
- **Date range**: Includes date(s) of service field
- **Email delivery**: Offers an email delivery option for receiving records
- **Photo ID upload**: Built-in identity verification via file upload
- **Sensitive information**: Explicit exclusion options for mental health, communicable diseases, and drug/alcohol records
- **HIPAA language**: Standard authorization language including 1-year expiration, right to revoke, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warning

The layout is structured with clear sections and the field count (~15-20 fields) is reasonable for a comprehensive records request.

## Barriers and Compliance

No unnecessary barriers were identified. There is no notarization requirement, no witness requirement, and no mandatory in-person submission. The form submits electronically upon completion. The NPP mentions that copies may incur a "reasonable fee" but provides no specific amounts — this is standard HIPAA language but leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **Digital-first, no-paper workflow**: Among the most modern approaches observed for a community hospital of this size
- **Patient self-access clearly supported**: "Patient/Self" is an explicit option, not an afterthought
- **Comprehensive NPP**: Includes an unusually detailed Kansas HIT/HIO section and complete Privacy Officer contact information (name, address, phone, email)
- **Email delivery option**: Patients can request records via email, going beyond the typical CD or paper delivery

## Weaknesses and Concerns

- **URL typo**: The Formstack subdomain "labetteheatlh" (missing an "h") is fragile — if corrected upstream, existing links would break
- **No PDF alternative**: Patients without reliable internet access have no downloadable form option (only in-person office visit)
- **NPP doesn't link to the form**: The NPP tells patients to "complete a specific form" to exercise access rights but never identifies which form or where to find it
- **Website blocks automated access**: 403 errors on HTTP fetches could impact accessibility tools or screen readers that rely on direct URL access

## Overall Assessment

Labette Health provides a genuinely patient-centered, digital-first records request experience that stands out for an independent community hospital. The Formstack form is well-designed, comprehensive, and clearly accommodates patient self-access. The main gaps are the lack of a PDF fallback, the URL typo, and the disconnect between the NPP and the actual request mechanism. Overall, this organization earns a **B grade** — above average in technical accessibility and patient-centeredness, with minor findability and disclosure gaps preventing a top score.

# Huntington Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Huntington Hospital, a community hospital in Huntington, NY, is part of the Northwell Health system and uses Northwell's system-wide forms for all records requests. Four documents were retrieved: a general third-party Authorization for Release of Health Information (form-1) with companion instructions (form-2), and a dedicated patient-specific Request for Access form (form-3) with its own companion instructions (form-4). The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-3**, the "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative."

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Access Form

Northwell Health distinguishes itself by maintaining **two separate form types**: one for third-party release (form-1) and one specifically for patient self-access (form-3). This two-form architecture is uncommon among healthcare organizations and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to HIPAA compliance. Form-3 opens with an explicit citation of HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524, informing patients of their right of access, and presents "To me" as the first recipient option — signaling that patient self-access is the primary use case, not an afterthought.

However, there is a notable gap: form-1 (the third-party release form) contains **no cross-reference** to form-3. A patient who encounters the general authorization first would have no indication that a separate, more appropriate form exists for their self-access request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. All four documents are directly linked from the Northwell Health medical records page at northwell.edu. The main friction point was search disambiguation — "Huntington Hospital" also refers to a facility in California, requiring "Northwell" to be added to queries. No facility-specific forms exist at huntington.northwell.edu; patients must navigate to the parent system site. URLs are descriptive (e.g., `request-for-access-to-health-information-form-english-2022.pdf`), and the filename's "english" suffix hints at a multilingual intent, though no non-English versions were found during retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a strong document. At **2 pages with 28 fillable fields**, it is a genuinely interactive PDF that patients can complete digitally without printing. The layout follows a logical numbered structure: patient demographics, source facility, recipient, delivery method/format matrix, record type selection, substance use/HIV consent section, and signature block. The delivery options are notably comprehensive — mail, facility pickup, secure email, unsecure email (with explicit risk acknowledgment), fax, USB flash drive, and CD.

The language is generally accessible, using informal parenthetical labels like "(From Who)" that prioritize clarity over grammatical precision. The companion instruction document (form-4) provides step-by-step guidance with concrete examples ("Jane Patient," "Dr. Jane Jones at 300 Northwell Drive"), which is a genuine accessibility aid.

The form does have minor weaknesses: the delivery method matrix with nested checkboxes requires careful reading, and the witness signature line is ambiguous — it doesn't state whether a witness is required or optional, which could create a perceived barrier.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and does not mandate in-person submission. The expiration field applies only to substance use disorder and HIV records (consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 and NY law), not to the general access request — a correct implementation. No fees are disclosed, which avoids discouragement but leaves patients without cost visibility.

The most significant gap is the **absence of submission instructions**. Neither form-3 nor its instructions (form-4) specify where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link is provided. A patient could fill out the form perfectly and still not know what to do with it. This is a systemic gap across all four Northwell documents.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation — rare among healthcare organizations
- **28 fillable fields** enabling fully digital completion
- **Companion instruction documents** with annotated visual examples — genuinely helpful and uncommon
- **Comprehensive delivery format options** including USB flash drive and secure/unsecure email with informed consent

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No submission instructions** on any form or instruction document
- **No cross-reference** between the third-party form (form-1) and patient access form (form-3)
- **Witness line ambiguity** may deter patients who assume a witness is mandatory
- **Third-party form (form-1) lacks fillable fields** despite patient access form having 28 — inconsistent modernization

## Overall Assessment

Huntington Hospital, through its parent system Northwell Health, provides an above-average patient access experience. The dedicated patient access form with HIPAA citation, fillable fields, comprehensive delivery options, and companion instructions represent genuine investment in patient-centered design. The primary gaps — missing submission instructions and lack of cross-referencing between forms — are meaningful but do not fundamentally obstruct access. This organization earns a **B grade**, reflecting strong patient-centeredness and good document quality with room for improvement in workflow completeness.

# Emory University Hospital — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Emory University Hospital, part of the Emory Healthcare system, offers four documents on its medical records page: a current English ROI authorization form (form-1, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), a legacy 4-page ROI package (form-2, ~September 2022), a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), and a Request for Amendment form (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting records is form-1, the current English authorization. Emory also provides a Swellbox/Datavant online records request wizard as an alternative digital pathway.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Emory does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release authorization. The primary form is a generic "Authorization for the Release of Protected Health Information" used for all release scenarios — patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties all use the same document. However, the form does include "At my request" as a named purpose option, and its delivery methods include MyChart and EHI Export, signaling awareness that patients are a key audience. A patient requesting their own records must fill themselves in as the recipient, navigating a form framework designed around the third-party release paradigm. The Swellbox portal offers a somewhat more guided digital alternative, but the overall process does not clearly distinguish HIPAA Right of Access requests from general authorization-based releases.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A targeted web search for Emory Healthcare medical records forms surfaced the PDF URL directly, and the medical records page at `emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records` is well-organized with clear links to all relevant documents — English and Spanish authorization forms, fee sheets, e-delivery instructions, amendment form, and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed. The descriptive filename convention (`english-authorization-form-fillable-revised-11-2025.pdf`) is a small but meaningful usability detail. One minor issue: the URL path includes a `/wr/` segment (likely referencing the Warner Robins facility), which could confuse patients at other Emory locations.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely fillable 2-page PDF with approximately 100 interactive fields (checkboxes and text inputs), though the PDF's AES-256 encryption caused metadata tools to report zero fillable fields. The form is organized into numbered sections covering facility selection (18+ Emory Healthcare locations), recipient and delivery information, record type specification (17+ granular checkboxes with date fields), and purpose. The layout is clean and logical. Language is a mix of clear structural labels and moderately dense legal text on page 2 (revocation rights, re-disclosure warnings, sensitive information waiver). The form is not tagged for screen reader accessibility.

A notable strength is the range of delivery options: paper, CD, USB drive, MyChart, mail, pick-up, e-delivery website, email, and — remarkably — **EHI Export**, a forward-thinking option that very few organizations surface on their authorization forms. The Spanish-language version (form-3) mirrors the English structure, though it has character encoding issues (accented characters rendering as digits) and incomplete translation of institutional terms.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. No in-person submission requirement exists — patients can fax or use the Swellbox portal. The primary form does not disclose fees directly; a separate fee sheet ($6.50 flat for electronic delivery, $0.07/page for paper) is available on the medical records page. The legacy form-2 required a separate fee acknowledgment signature, but the current form-1 does not. The form does include a blanket waiver for sensitive information (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health) that does not allow patients to opt out of releasing specific sensitive categories — a common but patient-unfriendly approach.

## Overall Assessment

Emory Healthcare provides a competent, well-organized records request process with several standout features — particularly the EHI Export delivery option, the Spanish-language form, and the Swellbox online portal. The forms are easy to find, fillable, and recently updated. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must use the same generic authorization form as third-party requesters, without clear guidance on how to request their own records specifically. The form accommodates patient requests but was not designed around them as a first-class use case. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and well-maintained, but not yet patient-centered in its design philosophy.

# Cordova Community Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cordova Community Medical Center (CCMC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Cordova, Alaska. It offers a single Release of Information form for all medical records requests — a one-page, general-purpose HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

CCMC provides one pathway for records requests: a downloadable PDF authorization form linked from the Medical Records page at `https://www.cdvcmc.com/for-patients/medical-records/`. The form can be printed, completed by hand, and faxed to Medical Records at (907) 424-8406 or the Clinic Nurse at (907) 424-8202. No online submission portal, email submission option, or patient portal alternative exists. The website's Medical Records page reportedly discusses format options for receiving records (paper, email, CD, or fax), but the form itself does not capture a delivery format preference.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

CCMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured around "Release my information to [NAME]" — a third-party release frame. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in the recipient field and select "Personal reasons" as the purpose, which is unintuitive. The purpose checkboxes ("Continuation of care," "Insurance purposes," "Employer requirement," "Legal review") are overwhelmingly third-party scenarios. While technically usable for patient self-access, the form was clearly designed around the third-party authorization model, not individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The Medical Records page is intuitively located under "For Patients" and links directly to the form download. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, authentication, or portal login was encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a flat (non-fillable) PDF — digitally authored with a proper text layer, but with zero interactive fields. Patients must print and handwrite all entries. At one page and approximately 15 fields (patient name, DOB, MR#, recipient name/address/phone, purpose checkboxes, record type checkboxes, date range, sensitive information initial, signature, and date), the scope is reasonable. The layout uses a numbered section structure (1–7) that flows logically from authorization through scope, limitations, revocation, rights, and signature. However, the dense legal text in sections 3–7 and the redisclosure notice create a visually cramped single page. Three fonts provide some typographic hierarchy. The language shifts from accessible in the early sections to regulatory legalese in the later sections, particularly around revocation and redisclosure.

Section 2 offers excellent record-type granularity — twelve specific categories plus "Other" and date-range fields — giving patients meaningful control over what is released. Section 7's acceptance of photocopies as originals is a practical accommodation.

## Barriers

No notarization is required. Photo ID "may be required" — stated as a possibility, not an absolute mandate. No fees are mentioned on the form. The form expires three months from signature, which is short but sufficient for a single access request. There is no stated turnaround time on the form itself.

A notable concern is Section 3's all-or-nothing handling of sensitive information: alcohol/drug abuse, HIV-AIDS, mental health, and psychiatric treatment are bundled into a single initial, with an undefined "qualify above" alternative. This is problematic given the form's own citation of 42 CFR Part 2 protections for substance abuse records, which require specific consent for each disclosure.

The form's 45 CFR 164.524 citation is misapplied — used in the redisclosure context rather than to inform patients of their access rights. The form was last updated in 2016, making it nearly a decade old.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:** Excellent findability; compact single-page design; comprehensive record-type selection; photocopies accepted; fax submission available (adequate electronic pathway).

**Weaknesses:** Not fillable; does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release; sensitive information bundling; stale document (2016); delivery format not captured on form; legal language in later sections.

## Overall Assessment

CCMC provides a functional but dated records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it was designed for third-party release rather than patient self-access. The non-fillable format and print-fax workflow reflect a paper-first mindset. For a small, remote critical access hospital, the form is adequate but falls short of patient-centered design. A patient can navigate the process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary user.

# Ascension St. Vincent's East — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension St. Vincent's East is a community hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the Ascension health system that has recently partnered with or been rebranded under UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). This branding transition is the defining feature of the patient experience: two forms exist on two different websites under two different organizational names, and a patient searching under the facility's commonly known name may land on the wrong (legacy) form.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF authorization forms were found:

- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An Ascension St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization To Disclose Protected Health Information" revised February 2022, hosted on `healthcare.ascension.org` in a URL path containing the word "legacy." This 2.8 MB, 2-page form is a general-purpose ROI authorization with no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. It collects Social Security Number, lists notarized signature among identity verification options, and requires a witness signature — all potential barriers. On the positive side, it explicitly cites CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access).

- **form-2.pdf** (current): A UAB St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records" dated February 2026, hosted on `uabstvincents.org`. This is the current, most relevant form. At 143 KB and 2 pages, it is a cleaner, digital-origin document. It explicitly lists "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department" as a selectable location and includes a checkbox for "me for my personal use" — a meaningful distinction from forms that only contemplate third-party release.

The best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-2, which accommodates patient self-access as a first-class option alongside third-party authorization.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Form-2 does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release via a checkbox ("me for my personal use" vs. "the party indicated below"). This is a genuine improvement over many ROI forms and over this facility's own predecessor form. However, form-2 remains a generic authorization form — not a dedicated patient access request form. The same form, same legal language, and same process apply whether the patient wants their own records or is authorizing release to an insurer or attorney. A patient must navigate legal language about re-disclosure, initial two dense paragraphs about revocation and non-conditioning, and understand which fields apply to their scenario.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form required moderate effort. Initial searches for "Ascension St. Vincent's East" yielded system-wide Ascension forms from other states. An Alabama-specific search found the legacy form-1 on the Ascension domain. Only a separate search for "UAB St. Vincent's" uncovered the current form-2 on the UAB domain. A patient who knows this facility by its Ascension name would likely find only the outdated 2022 form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed — both PDFs downloaded directly.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a digital-origin PDF with a text layer, reasonable file size, and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all entries must be handwritten after printing. The form uses horizontal rules to separate sections and offers a well-designed tiered record selection (Key Clinical Notes bundle, Entire Medical Record, or specific report types). The "Key Clinical Notes" option — pre-defined as discharge summary, operative reports, labs, radiology, and ED documentation — is a genuine usability bright spot that helps patients who don't know medical terminology.

The opening paragraph front-loads dense legal language before the patient even fills in their name. The form contains a contradictory treatment of sensitive records: the opening paragraph states the request "includes" psychiatric and substance use information, while a later checkbox asks whether to include it. The submission instructions are indirect — rather than printing a mailing address, the form directs patients to visit a website.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-2 removes several barriers present in the legacy form: no Social Security Number field, no notarization option, no witness requirement. Non-conditioning and revocation rights are clearly stated (with initialing required). However, the form provides no fee disclosure whatsoever — patients have no idea what records will cost. The HIPAA Right of Access citation (CFR 164.524) present in form-1 was dropped in form-2, a notable regression. Submission appears limited to physical mail; no fax number or electronic submission option for the completed form is stated.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension St. Vincent's East earns credit for a reasonably well-designed authorization form that explicitly accommodates patient self-access with a personal-use checkbox and offers tiered record selection. However, the experience is undermined by the branding transition that makes the current form hard to find, zero fillable fields requiring a fully paper workflow, apparent mail-only form submission, and absent fee disclosure. The result is a facility that has the right instincts on patient-centeredness but falls short on digital accessibility and transparency.

# University of Mississippi Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

UMMC provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (Form #1862) in two language versions. Form-1 is a Spanish-language version (Rev. 05/2025) retrieved from the Wayback Machine, and form-2 is an older English-language version (Rev. 04/2018) obtained from a third-party caching site (pdf4pro.com). Both are one-page PDFs covering all UMMC locations. No dedicated patient access form, online portal, or web-based request wizard was identified. No separate fee schedule or patient rights document was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UMMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to third parties — the "Release to" field and purpose options like Legal/Attorney, Insurance, and Workers' Compensation reflect a third-party orientation. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal" as the purpose and enter their own contact information in the "Release to" field, which is a confusing and unintuitive workflow. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or informs patients of their affirmative right to access their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **extremely difficult**. The English PDF link on UMMC's website returns HTTP 404, and an older compliance-page URL is also broken. Five different retrieval strategies were attempted: direct web search, curl (failed due to DNS), Wayback Machine, browser-based archive navigation, and finally a third-party cache. The Spanish version was the only form still live at its canonical URL. The English form was only available via pdf4pro.com — a source no typical patient would find. This represents a critical findability failure for a major teaching hospital: a patient visiting the UMMC website today and clicking the Release Form link reaches a dead end.

## Form Document Quality

Using the **high-watermark principle**, the Spanish form (form-1) is the better document: it has 70 fillable/interactive fields, a native text layer, and was clearly designed as a digital-first PDF. The English form (form-2) has zero fillable fields and requires printing and handwriting. Both forms share identical structure: location selection → patient info → release-to info → purpose checkboxes → 14 record-type checkboxes → sensitive information initials → patient rights paragraph → signature block with witness. The layout is logically organized but cramped, fitting everything onto a single page at the cost of readability. The Patient Rights section is a dense, unbroken paragraph of legal text with no bullet points or visual hierarchy. Three delivery formats are offered — Paper, Electronic, and "View Access as scheduled" — but none are defined, and critically, **no submission instructions appear on either form** (no fax number, no mailing address for initial submission, no email, no portal link).

## Barriers

- **Witness signature required**: Both forms mandate a witness, which HIPAA does not require. This is a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **SSN collection**: Both forms request the patient's full Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates identity theft risk.
- **Incomplete forms rejected**: The header warns that incomplete forms will not be accepted, but does not clarify which fields are mandatory.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions fees, costs, or the patient's right to cost-based pricing.
- **No submission instructions**: A patient completing the form has no way to know where to send it.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering Spanish and English versions is a genuine accessibility strength, especially for Mississippi's growing Spanish-speaking population.
- **Fillable PDF (Spanish version)**: 70 interactive fields allow digital completion.
- **Electronic delivery option**: The form explicitly offers "Electronic" as a delivery format.
- **Granular record selection**: 14 specific record categories with a clarification that "Entire Medical Record" does not include images — a helpful transparency measure.
- **"Personal" purpose option**: Including this among pre-printed options legitimizes patient self-access.

## Overall Assessment

UMMC provides a generic, moderately well-designed authorization form that serves patients as an afterthought rather than a primary audience. The critical findability failure — a broken English PDF link on the organization's own website — is the most acute problem: a patient cannot currently obtain the form from UMMC online. The Spanish version survives but would not serve most English-speaking patients. The witness requirement and SSN collection add unnecessary friction. The absence of submission instructions is a significant gap. While the Spanish form's fillable fields and bilingual availability are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects an organization that has not prioritized patient self-access as a distinct use case.

# ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

ENT & Allergy Associates is a large for-profit physician practice with 80+ offices across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Despite its size, the organization provides one of the poorest records-request experiences in this study. The sole ROI form is a 17-year-old Microsoft Word document buried on the website with no visible link, no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no pathway designed for patients requesting their own records.

## Forms & Pathways

Two documents were retrieved:

1. **form-1.pdf** (the ROI form): "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA" — a 2-page generic third-party release authorization. Originally a `.doc` file created in 2009, converted to PDF for this study. This is the only records-release mechanism available.
2. **form-2.pdf** (not an ROI form): "Patient Acknowledgment Form – Allergy Form Completion Fee" — a $25 fee acknowledgment for physician form completion (school/activity clearance). Found in the footer under the misleading label "Allergy Authorization Form."

There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The only pathway is downloading a Word document and figuring out independently how to submit it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for releasing records to a named third party. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in Item 8 ("Name and address of person(s) or category of person to whom this information will be sent"), which is unintuitive and not explained anywhere. The form contains no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights statement specific to individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient may simply want to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was exceptionally difficult. The website has no "Patient Forms," "Medical Records," or "Request Your Records" section. The FAQ mentions medical records only in the context of retention policies. The footer link labeled "Allergy Authorization Form" leads to the fee acknowledgment (form-2), not the ROI form. The actual ROI form exists at an orphaned URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) not linked from any navigable page — it was only discoverable through a targeted `filetype:doc` web search. A patient browsing the website would have no path to this form.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a Word `.doc` file with zero fillable fields, requiring patients to either print and handwrite or type into the Word template. The layout uses a numbered list but lacks visual hierarchy — no section headers, minimal bold, and no section dividers. Language is moderately dense legalese with constructions like "except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization." Item 6 is entirely in ALL-CAPS and contains a typo ("THEN" instead of "THE"). The form collects approximately 12–15 pieces of information, including the patient's Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection point that creates a privacy risk.

## Barriers & Red Flags

- **No submission instructions whatsoever.** The form provides no address, fax number, email, or portal link. A patient who manages to find and complete it has no guidance on how to return it.
- **SSN requested.** Unnecessary for identity verification in records requests and a data security risk.
- **Severely outdated.** Last modified January 2009 — predates the HITECH Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the ONC Information Blocking Rule.
- **Confusing Item 6.** The ALL-CAPS restriction on discussing health information could be read to limit the provider's ability to discuss records even with the patient themselves.

## Bright Spots

- **Proper handling of sensitive categories.** The form correctly requires separate initialing for HIV, substance abuse, and mental health records, with anti-redisclosure language and civil rights contact information per NY/NJ state law.
- **Anti-conditioning statement.** Item 4 clearly states treatment and benefits will not be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

ENT & Allergy Associates presents a deeply patient-unfriendly records request experience. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, an outdated Word document format, zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no patient-access-specific pathway means that a patient attempting to request their records online would face barriers at every step. For a practice of this size and market presence, this represents a significant gap in patient-centered service. **Grade: D.**

# Texas Oncology — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Texas Oncology provides a single ROI form — an "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf). Both are 3-page fillable PDFs, structurally identical, revised 09/19/2024. They are available as direct downloads from a dedicated Medical Records page at texasoncology.com/medical-records. The page outlines a clear 3-step process: download the form, complete it, and submit by fax or mail.

No patient portal submission, online request wizard, or third-party vendor platform (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was found. The only request pathway is the downloadable PDF form submitted by fax or mail.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Texas Oncology does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party disclosure. The single form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering nine disclosure reasons — Treatment, Personal Use, Billing, Legal Purposes, Disability Determination, School, Employment, Health Oversight, and Other. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" and then navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios, including filling in both "I authorize the following to disclose" (naming Texas Oncology) and "Who can receive and use the health information?" (naming themselves). This is awkward when the requester and recipient are the same person.

Notably, page 2 of the form includes a legally accurate statement that "This form is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual," citing 45 CFR §§ 164.502(a)(1)(i) and 164.524. However, this critical information is buried in supplementary legal text — not surfaced on page 1 where a patient would see it before completing the 3-page form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible from footer navigation (approximately one click from the homepage). While older PDF URLs found via web search returned 404 errors due to a site migration to Sitecore Edge CDN, the live page links worked without issue. No bot blocking, login walls, or captchas were encountered. Overall retrieval difficulty: easy to moderate — the slight complication was dead legacy URLs, but the current page is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed fillable PDF with 95 interactive fields — a thoroughly digitized form designed for on-screen completion. The layout is clean and logical: patient demographics → reason for disclosure → authorizing party → recipient → delivery method → record types → time period → signature. Section headers in all caps provide clear visual hierarchy.

The form offers 16 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, radiology reports, pathology, etc.) plus "All Health Information" and "Other," giving patients meaningful granularity. Four sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, genetic information, HIV/AIDS) require separate initialing, consistent with HIPAA and Texas law.

The language is reasonably plain for a legal authorization form. The statement that treatment cannot be denied for refusing to sign is prominently placed at the top of page 1 — better positioning than many ROI forms. However, the fee language on page 2 contains a grammatical error ("There may charge a retrieval/processing fee") and fails to specify amounts or distinguish patient-access fees from third-party disclosure fees.

The 95 fillable fields lack semantic names in the PDF metadata (all field names are empty), which impairs accessibility for screen readers and assistive technology.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Barriers are low to moderate.** No notarization is required — only a patient signature. No in-person submission is required; fax and mail are both accepted. The authorization expiration is reasonable (valid until death, revocation, or optional specified date). Right to revoke is clearly stated. The form includes current reproductive health protections (45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)) with a dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page — demonstrating up-to-date compliance with 2024 federal rules.

The main barrier is the lack of electronic submission: despite the fillable PDF and email as a records *delivery* option, patients must still print, sign, and fax or mail the form. There is no e-signature, portal upload, or online submission pathway.

Fee disclosure is vague — "a retrieval/processing fee may be charged" without specifics. No response time commitment is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: A professionally translated Spanish version is offered as a parallel download — commendable for a Texas-based practice serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **Reproductive health protections**: The dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page is current with 2024 federal law.
- **Email delivery option**: Records can be delivered via email, providing a practical electronic access mechanism.
- **Treatment-not-conditioned**: Prominently positioned at the top of page 1.

## Overall Assessment

Texas Oncology provides a competent but generic records request experience. The form is well-built as a document — fillable, logically organized, bilingual, and legally current. However, it funnels patients through a third-party authorization process rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. The buried acknowledgment that the form "is not required" for patient self-access only underscores this mismatch. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience. The organization earns a **B** grade — solid document quality and accessibility, held back by the lack of a patient-centered access pathway.

# Synthesis: Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers

## Overview

Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers (Philadelphia, PA) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC historically focused on HIV/AIDS care. The organization maintains a well-organized "Forms and Consents" page on its website with direct PDF download links, offering forms in both English and Spanish. Two ROI-related forms were found: a dedicated patient access form (form-1) and a separate third-party authorization form (form-2).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Philadelphia FIGHT stands out by maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access and third-party release** — a best practice that many larger organizations fail to implement. Form-1, titled "Patient Request for Access to Information," is explicitly designed for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524). It opens with a clear rights statement and deals exclusively with the patient's own records. Form-2, the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Information," is a standard § 164.508 authorization for third-party disclosures. This structural separation means patients requesting their own records are not funneled through a generic authorization workflow designed for insurers, attorneys, or other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Forms and Consents page is accessible via the main navigation (About → Forms and Consents) and was surfaced quickly by a site-specific web search. Direct PDF download links with descriptive text ("Request for Access to Information Form") made identification easy. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or other technical obstacles were encountered. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-fill or PDF annotation workarounds. This is a meaningful gap given that the form was clearly authored digitally (7 fonts, embedded logo) and could easily have been made interactive.

The form's structure follows a logical flow: patient identification, scope of request (entire medical record, billing record, or specific records), access method (copy vs. inspection), format preference (paper or electronic with a "Specify" field), delivery method (pick up or mail), and requester identification (self, guardian, or representative). At one page, it is appropriately concise.

The language is moderately complex. The introductory paragraph front-loads legal information about timelines, fees, and denial rights in dense prose. While accurate, it could be more accessible if broken into bullet points. The form does not use explicit section headers beyond the internal-use divider.

## Submission Methods

Form-1 lists four submission channels: in-person, email (privacy@fight.org), fax (215-732-1145), and mail. The inclusion of **email submission** is a notable strength — many organizations limit submission to fax and mail. A patient can complete and submit the form without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **Fee language is vague**: The form describes four categories of chargeable costs (labor, supplies, postage, summary preparation) but provides no dollar amounts, fee schedule, or cost estimates. Costs are billed after fulfillment, with no mechanism for a patient to learn the cost in advance or set a spending limit.
- **No mention of right to appeal a denial**: The form states FIGHT may deny access but does not inform the patient of their right to request review of a denial, which HIPAA requires for reviewable denials under § 164.524(d)(4).
- **Response timeline stated**: 30 days, with possible 60-day extension — consistent with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **Email submission option** in addition to fax, mail, and in-person — a low-barrier digital channel.
- **Electronic format option** with an open "Specify" field, respecting the patient's right to choose format.
- **Adolescent self-access at age 13+**, reflecting Pennsylvania minor consent law.
- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) on the Forms and Consents page.
- **Sensitive information opt-out** on the third-party form, with granular categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) — especially relevant for this organization's patient population.

## Overall Assessment

Philadelphia FIGHT delivers an above-average patient access experience among FQHCs. The structural decision to separate patient access from third-party authorization is the standout feature, demonstrating clear understanding of HIPAA's distinct provisions. The form is concise, logically organized, and offers multiple submission channels including email. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a print-and-fill workflow), vague fee disclosures, and the omission of denial appeal rights. With relatively modest improvements — adding fillable fields and clarifying fees — this organization could achieve an excellent rating.

# Yale New Haven Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH), a major teaching hospital in New Haven, CT, is part of the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS). For medical records requests, YNHH uses a system-wide fillable PDF form titled "Authorization for Access/Release of Information" (Form F4918Eng, dated 07/19). A second form exists for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, another YNHHS facility, but it is not the primary form for YNHH patients. The assessment below focuses on Form 1 as the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records from Yale New Haven Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient-Friendly Features

YNHH does not offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from its third-party release authorization. The single system-wide form serves both purposes. However, the form makes notable accommodations for patient self-access: the title includes the word "Access" (not just "Release"), "Personal use" is listed as the first purpose option, and the form supports bidirectional requests (both "RELEASE information TO" and "OBTAIN information FROM"). Despite these touches, the underlying structure is a generic HIPAA authorization. A patient requesting their own records must designate themselves as the "recipient" — an awkward fit that reveals the form's third-party-release DNA. The form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or frame the request as an exercise of the patient's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search immediately surfaced it on the YNHHS parent system website, which hosts a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page with direct PDF download links. No login, account creation, or bot-blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on ynhhs.org (parent system) rather than ynhh.org (hospital), which is logical but could cause mild confusion for patients starting at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

Form 1 is an impressive digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 97 interactive form fields — one of the highest counts in the study. Every data-entry point appears to have an interactive field, enabling patients to complete the form entirely on-screen before printing for signature. The two-page layout follows a logical flow: patient identity → purpose → recipient → delivery method → facility/visit selection → date range → record types → sensitive information exclusions → legal disclosures → submission instructions → signature. Sections are clearly delineated and the form is dense but functional.

The language is mostly clear in the data-entry sections but shifts to dense legal prose in the "I understand that" statements on page 2. The minor consent paragraph is particularly complex, with nested age thresholds under Connecticut state law. The sensitive information section uses an opt-out model (all sensitive records released unless the patient initials specific exclusions), which is patient-friendly in intent but uses double-negative framing that could confuse.

## Submission and Delivery

The form offers robust submission options: mail (PO Box 9565, New Haven), fax (203-688-4645), and three email addresses differentiated by entity (Hospital, NEMG, Yale Medicine). This flexibility is a genuine strength — patients can submit electronically without visiting the facility.

For delivery, five options are available: MyChart portal (requiring an active account), mail, fax, secure email, and pick-up. MyChart delivery is a standout feature that most ROI forms lack, offering an end-to-end electronic pathway for records receipt.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The authorization is valid for one year, and revocation rights are clearly explained. The voluntariness statement is explicit: treatment is not conditioned on signing.

The main compliance gap is ambiguous fee language. "Reasonable cost-based fees apply" appears next to radiology images, while "There may be a charge for copies in accordance with Connecticut law" appears in the legal section. Neither amount is disclosed, and the form does not clarify whether the HIPAA cost-based fee ceiling applies when a patient requests their own records. The turnaround commitment of 10 business days is explicit and well within HIPAA's 30-day limit.

## Notable Strengths

- **97 fillable fields** — exceptionally high digital-first form design
- **MyChart delivery** — electronic records receipt via patient portal
- **Multiple submission channels** — three email addresses, fax, and mail
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific categories plus complete record option
- **10-business-day turnaround commitment** with a customer service phone number

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as third-party requesters
- **Wet signature required** — breaks the digital workflow (fill → print → sign → scan → email)
- **Fee language is ambiguous** — does not distinguish patient-access fees from third-party fees
- **Form last updated July 2019** — nearly seven years old, may not reflect current policies
- **No multilingual versions found**

## Overall Assessment

Yale New Haven Hospital provides a competent, digitally mature records request experience that falls short of true patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF, multiple submission/delivery options, and MyChart integration demonstrate genuine investment in accessibility. However, the organization has not taken the step of creating a distinct patient access pathway — patients must navigate a dual-purpose authorization form designed primarily for third-party release. The result is a solid B-level experience: functional and mostly friction-free, but not designed around the patient's perspective.

# East Georgia Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

East Georgia Healthcare Center (EGHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Swainsboro, Georgia. Three documents were found on its website: an English-language Medical Records Release form (form-1), a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The critical finding is that **none of these documents serve a patient requesting their own records from EGHC**. Both release forms are designed exclusively for incoming records — authorizing other providers to send records *to* EGHC — with EGHC's own address hardcoded as the destination.

## Access Pathway: The Wrong Form Problem

EGHC exemplifies the "wrong form" problem identified in this study. The Medical Records Release form's key language reads: *"I hereby request copies of all records pertaining to my health history and medical care released to: EAST GEORGIA HEALTHCARE CENTER, 215 NORTH COLEMAN STREET, SWAINSBORO, GA 30401."* The "Requesting medical records from" field is where the patient fills in their *previous* provider. A patient trying to exercise their HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) to obtain records *from* EGHC would find no applicable form anywhere on the website.

The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — it simply does not address patient self-access at all. The Notice of Privacy Practices mentions the right to "inspect and copy medical information" but provides no actionable instructions, no form reference, and no guidance on how to actually submit a request. A patient would likely need to call the Privacy Officer or visit in person, with no written process to guide them.

## Retrieval Experience

The forms page at https://eghc.org/forms/ is findable within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via site navigation. However, the forms are hosted on RightSignature, a third-party e-signature platform, which requires entering a name and email before viewing the form content. Old direct PDF links (from 2019) now return 404 errors but still appear in search engine results, creating confusing dead ends. The retrieval required moderate effort: the forms page was located without difficulty, but extracting the actual form content from RightSignature required technical workarounds (extracting the S3-hosted PNG image and converting to PDF).

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page document with clean layout and clear visual hierarchy: letterhead at top, patient identification fields, destination address, source provider field, a granular 17-option record type checklist, release duration options, legal disclaimer, and signature block. Via the RightSignature platform, the form is interactive with fillable fields and e-signature capability — a meaningful step toward digital-first form handling. However, the standalone captured PDF is image-only with no text layer, no fillable fields, and is completely inaccessible to screen readers.

The language is moderately accessible — the legal disclaimer covers standard HIPAA authorization elements (revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, non-conditioning) without being impenetrably dense. The form collects approximately 10 fields, which is reasonable in scope. However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, which creates unnecessary data exposure risk given that name, date of birth, and address are already collected.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No patient access form**: The most significant barrier — a patient has no written pathway to request their own records.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers on a form designed for fax/mail transmission is an unnecessary privacy risk.
- **Missing authorization expiration**: The form lacks an explicit expiration date, a required element under 45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(v).
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees for record copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form text gives no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **RightSignature viewing barrier**: Patients must provide name and email before even viewing the form content.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Both English and Spanish versions of the release form are offered — appropriate for an FQHC serving a diverse community in south-central Georgia.
- **RightSignature e-signature**: Electronic completion and submission capability is a genuine digital-first investment, even if applied to the wrong form.
- **Granular record type selection**: The 17-category checklist with an "Other" option gives patients meaningful control over what information is released.
- **Title X confidentiality**: The NPP includes thoughtful language about Title X Family Planning Program confidentiality.

## Overall Assessment

EGHC has invested in some positive infrastructure — bilingual forms, an e-signature platform, and a navigable forms page — but these investments are undermined by a fundamental gap: the organization provides no form or pathway for patients to request their own records. The only ROI-related forms are designed for incoming records from other providers. A patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access would find their rights acknowledged in the NPP but no actionable way to exercise them online. This represents a significant patient-centeredness failure that overshadows the form's otherwise reasonable document quality.

# University Medical Center of Southern Nevada — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC) is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Las Vegas. Three documents were retrieved: two versions of the same PHI Release Authorization form (a current 2019 version and a superseded 2016 version) and a Request for Amendment form. The primary form for patient self-access is the 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

UMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting one's own records is a generic "Protected Health Information (PHI) Release Authorization" form — the same form used for third-party disclosures to attorneys, insurers, and other providers. The form includes a "Patient (self)" checkbox under the recipient section, which adapts it for self-access use, but the framing remains third-party-oriented: "I authorize the following facility(ies) to release my Protected Health Information." A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access must navigate the same full authorization form as someone authorizing release to a third party, including selecting a "purpose" (Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Care) — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access requests.

## Findability: A Significant Gap

The most striking finding is a disconnect between the website and the ROI form. UMC's Medical Records page (`umcsn.com/patients-visitors/patient-information/medical-records-and-birth-certificate-process`) links only to the Request for Amendment form — it does **not** link to the PHI Release Authorization that patients need to request copies of their records. The ROI form is only discoverable via web search or by knowing the direct URL. Compounding this, the superseded 2016 version remains hosted at an active URL with no indication it is obsolete, meaning patients could unknowingly submit the wrong version. This is a serious findability failure for a core patient rights document.

## Form Document Quality

The 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf) is a two-page, digitally-composed PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (9 fonts, 3 embedded images), it offers no interactive form fields. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and then determine how to submit it.

The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → facility selection → record type selection → sensitive information consent → recipient → purpose/format → legal statements → signature. The structure is reasonable, but institutional conventions undermine usability. The header instruction "PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" assumes clinical context meaningless to a patient at home. An unexplained barcode-like code ("*ROIRCD*") appears at the top. The header states "Page 1 of 1" on what is actually a 2-page document.

Language is mostly clear but formal. The sensitive information section deserves credit for its granular, well-explained approach — five categories (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, psychotherapy, genetic records) each with individual Yes/No consent and required initials.

## Submission: A Critical Omission

The ROI form specifies how records will be *delivered* to the patient (mail, fax, email, CD-ROM, pick-up) but does **not** state how to *submit the completed authorization*. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or portal URL appears on the form for submission. The only address on the form is for written revocation. By contrast, the amendment form (form-3) provides four clear submission channels: mail, walk-in, fax (702-207-8330), and email (HIMManagementAnalysts@umcsn.com). A patient would need to locate this information independently — likely from the Medical Records page that paradoxically doesn't link to the ROI form.

## Barriers and Compliance

UMC avoids several common barriers: no notarization is required, Social Security Number is explicitly marked as optional, and the form includes good rights language (voluntariness, non-conditioning of treatment, right to revoke). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "subject to reproduction fees in accordance with federal / state regulations" — without specifying amounts or noting that fees for patient self-access are limited by law. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions found.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular sensitive information controls**: Five-category consent with individual opt-in/opt-out is better than most ROI forms
- **Email as a delivery option**: Listed alongside mail, fax, CD-ROM, and pick-up
- **SS# marked optional**: Explicit labeling that many forms omit
- **"Patient (self)" checkbox**: Acknowledges patient self-access as a use case

## Overall Assessment

UMC provides a functional but poorly surfaced records request process. The form itself is adequate — clearly structured with good sensitive-information handling and reasonable rights language. But the patient experience is undermined by three compounding failures: the form isn't linked from the obvious website location, it isn't fillable despite being digitally composed, and it doesn't tell patients how to submit it. A patient navigating UMC's website in the expected way would find the amendment form but not the release authorization form. The organization treats records release as an institutional process that patients happen to participate in, rather than as a patient right that deserves a dedicated, discoverable pathway.

# Valley Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valley Medical Group (VMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice with offices in Amherst, Easthampton, Greenfield, and Northampton, Massachusetts. For medical records requests, VMG fully delegates to **MediCopy**, a third-party Health Information Management vendor. The practice does not publish its own ROI form — instead, its website (vmgma.com) features a prominent "REQUEST RECORDS" link that redirects patients to MediCopy's patient portal at medicopy.net.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Two PDF authorization forms were found, both hosted on MediCopy's website:

- **form-1.pdf** — MediCopy's generic English-language authorization for release of medical records
- **form-2.pdf** — Spanish-language version of the same MediCopy form

MediCopy also offers an online HelloSign-based authorization (https://app.hellosign.com/s/01LCH5zj), providing a fully digital alternative to the PDF. The English PDF (form-1.pdf) is the most relevant document for assessing the patient experience, as it is the standard-language version of the form VMG patients are directed to use.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

VMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic MediCopy release-of-information authorizations designed for sending records to a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own information twice — once as the patient and again as the recipient — and select "Personal Use" from the purpose options. While "Personal Use" is listed, the form's structure (with separate "patient" and "recipient" sections) is clearly oriented toward disclosure to others. There is no dedicated patient access form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no streamlined self-request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form requires **moderate effort**. The "REQUEST RECORDS" link on vmgma.com is visible in the header and footer, which is helpful. However, clicking it sends the patient to medicopy.net — a third-party domain that may feel unfamiliar or untrustworthy. From there, the patient must navigate to MediCopy's ROI landing page to find the downloadable PDF, a 3-click cross-domain journey. A web search for "Valley Medical Group medical records request" would not surface the MediCopy form, since it contains no VMG branding whatsoever. The "Facility Name" field is blank — patients must know what to write.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (7 fonts, proper text extraction), it functions as a print-and-fill document. The layout is clean and uses conversational section headers phrased as questions ("Tell us about the patient," "What would you like released?"), which is more approachable than typical legal-heavy forms. Record type selection offers 11 checkboxes plus exclusion options for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postage.

However, the form has **no submission instructions** — no address, fax number, or email for returning the completed authorization. A patient who downloads this PDF in isolation would have no idea where to send it. The file is also disproportionately large (1.39 MB for one page).

## Barriers and Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required** — positive
- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for a records release and creates a privacy risk
- **Fee disclosure**: The English form mentions an "additional fee" for postage but provides no fee schedule; the Spanish form references 45 CFR 164.524 and mentions a "reasonable fee" but discloses no amounts
- **No response time commitment** stated
- **Default release of sensitive records**: The opt-out framing means substance abuse, HIV, and psychiatric records are released unless the patient affirmatively checks exclusion boxes

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — meaningful for a small independent practice
- **Online HelloSign alternative** exists alongside the PDF, providing a digital submission pathway
- **Email delivery option** for receiving records
- **Sensitive-information exclusion checkboxes** give patients granular control
- **Conversational, plain-language headers** make the form approachable

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No VMG branding or customization** — completely generic MediCopy form
- **No fillable fields** on the PDF despite digital creation
- **No submission instructions** on the form itself
- **SSN collection** is unnecessary and risky
- **No patient rights statement** regarding Right of Access or fee limitations
- **Poor Spanish translation** with mistranslations ("lanzado" for "released") and grammatical errors

## Overall Assessment

Valley Medical Group provides a functional but generic pathway for records requests through its MediCopy partnership. The "REQUEST RECORDS" link on the homepage is a reasonable starting point, and the availability of both a PDF form and an online HelloSign option gives patients choices. However, the complete lack of VMG customization, the absence of fillable PDF fields, missing submission instructions, and the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release all indicate a process that was outsourced without much thought given to the patient experience. The form serves its administrative purpose but does not center the patient.

# Hartford Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hartford Hospital is part of Hartford HealthCare (HHC), a regional nonprofit health system in Connecticut. For medical records requests, the organization uses the system-wide "Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information" form (HH Forms 571559, Rev. 11-2022), a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all 11 HHC facilities. Three PDF documents were retrieved: the system-wide form hosted on two different HHC domains (form-1 and form-3, which are textually identical), and an older Institute of Living–specific variant from 2012 (form-2). The primary form for a patient seeking their own records is form-1.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Route

Hartford Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The system-wide form is a general-purpose authorization designed equally for third-party release (to insurers, attorneys, other providers) and patient self-access. The form's structure — "I authorize _____ to disclose/obtain health information to: ______" — is fundamentally oriented around third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must puzzle over which blank to fill with the hospital's name and which with their own.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient" as one checkbox alongside "Medical," "Legal," "Disability," and "Insurance," correctly marked as "(Optional)." But the form offers no simplified pathway, no separate section, and no explanatory text for patients exercising their Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524. The patient must navigate the same form and fields designed for attorneys and insurance companies.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The parent system's medical records page at `hartfordhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/patients/medical-records` is well-organized and links directly to the authorization form. However, a patient starting at `hartfordhospital.org` must navigate to the parent system's site. A previously indexed URL for the form now returns a 404 error, meaning patients following older search results or bookmarks encounter a dead link. The current URL uses an opaque numeric filename (`571559.pdf`) that gives no indication of the document's contents.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised in November 2022, every field is rendered as static underscored blank lines. A patient must print the form and complete it by hand — or use a PDF annotation tool as a workaround. For a major regional health system, the absence of any interactive form fields is a significant missed opportunity.

The layout is dense but logically organized: patient identification → source/destination → delivery method → record types → purpose → rights/signature. However, the form opens with staff-facing administrative fields (MR#, Date Completed, Pages Copied, Initials) that have no relevance to patients and may cause confusion. The record type section offers 19 checkbox options — useful granularity for specificity but potentially overwhelming for patients who simply want "my records." Sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse, reproductive health) are appropriately broken out with corresponding legal notices on page 2.

The language is moderately legalistic. The opening sentence is a dense multi-clause construction that packs in references to mental illness, substance abuse, HIV, and reproductive services. Page 2's legal notices contain typographical errors ("If the event" instead of "In the event") and inconsistent capitalization.

## Submission Methods and Barriers

The form lists fax numbers and mailing addresses for all 11 HHC facilities, making submission by fax or mail straightforward. There is no email address, web portal, or online submission option. Fax qualifies as an adequate electronic pathway per our scoring baseline.

**No notarization or witness is required.** No fees are mentioned on the form. The form correctly states that treatment is not conditioned on signing the authorization, and that the patient may inspect or copy their information. The purpose field is correctly marked optional.

## Bright Spots

- **Comprehensive facility directory**: All 11 HHC facilities listed with addresses and fax numbers as checkboxes, eliminating the common pain point of not knowing where to send the form.
- **Connecticut-specific protections**: Detailed legal notice blocks for HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, and reproductive health records, citing applicable state and federal law.
- **Purpose marked optional**: Correctly implements the HIPAA principle that patients need not justify access requests.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Separate checkboxes for specially protected categories give patients granular control.

## Red Flags

- **Stale URL returning 404**: Older links to the form lead to a dead end.
- **Confusing dual-purpose "disclose/obtain" structure**: Patients must determine which direction of information flow applies to them.
- **"Electronic" delivery undefined**: Listed as an option with no explanation of what it means in practice.
- **Typographical errors**: Multiple instances of "If the event" instead of "In the event" on page 2.

## Overall Assessment

Hartford Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request experience. The system-wide form covers the basics and includes appropriate compliance language, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and generic third-party authorization structure all represent missed opportunities to serve patients well. The form is a C-grade experience: a patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them in mind.

# Community Health Center of Central Missouri — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Community Health Center of Central Missouri (CHCCMO), an independent nonprofit FQHC with four clinic locations across central Missouri, publishes a single general-purpose ROI form — an "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." Two versions were found: a current 2025 update (form-1) and a superseded 2023 version (form-2). Both are hosted as publicly accessible WordPress uploads on chccmo.org. There is no online portal, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no dedicated patient access form. The PDF form, submitted by fax, mail, email, or in-person pickup, is the only pathway.

## Access Pathway: No Individual Access Differentiation

CHCCMO does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party release. Both versions use a generic FROM/TO routing structure designed for provider-to-provider transfers. The 2025 form asks patients to specify "Please send my records FROM" and "Please send my records TO," with checkboxes for CHCCMO or "Other" at each end. A patient wanting their own records must navigate this structure, filling in their personal information in the TO field — a workflow clearly designed for transfers between entities, not for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). Neither form references HIPAA, the Right of Access, or patient access rights beyond a brief acknowledgment section.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **trivially easy**. A standard web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No site navigation, bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The filename (`Release-of-Records-updated-2025.pdf`) is descriptive. However, the older 2023 version remains publicly accessible at a different URL with no indication it is superseded, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The 2025 form (form-1) is the primary document and represents the organization's current offering. It is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite all entries. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → sender/receiver routing → delivery method → record types → date range → purpose → acknowledgment → signature. However, the page is densely packed, and the multi-column layout in the record type and purpose sections may fragment reading order. The acknowledgment section is a single dense paragraph of legal boilerplate rather than numbered, digestible points.

Positive document features include email as a delivery option (alongside fax, mail, and pickup), preset date range options ("Last 12 months" / "Last 24 months"), and a comprehensive list of 10 named record categories. The form is concise at one page. However, it contains a misspelled heading ("AKNOWLEDGEMENT") and inconsistent ZIP codes between the form body and footer (65101 vs. 65110).

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate. This creates a procedural barrier, particularly for patients completing the form at home. The sensitive records clause bundles all sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing) into a single all-or-nothing authorization without granular opt-in/opt-out, which may conflict with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records. The 2025 form does not mention fees, leaving the cost question ambiguous; the older 2023 version references potential copying costs. No notarization is required. Submission can be done via fax or email, so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: Extremely easy findability; concise one-page form; email as a delivery option (uncommon among ROI forms); preset date range options reduce friction; comprehensive record type selection; non-conditioning and revocation language included.

**Weaknesses**: No dedicated patient access pathway — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization form; no fillable PDF fields despite being digitally created; witness requirement adds unnecessary friction; sensitive records bundling; typos and address inconsistencies in the form; no HIPAA Right of Access language; no response time commitment in the 2025 version (the 2023 version mentions 30 days).

## Overall Assessment

CHCCMO makes its ROI form easy to find and keeps it concise, but the form itself reflects a provider-centric rather than patient-centric design philosophy. It treats all records requests — whether from patients, insurers, attorneys, or other providers — identically through a generic authorization form. The lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, and the absence of any Right of Access language mean that a patient requesting their own records faces unnecessary friction and receives no acknowledgment that this is a right, not a favor. The organization earns credit for easy findability and electronic submission options, but falls short on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and compliance hygiene.

# Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola is a community hospital in the Florida panhandle, part of the Ascension health system — one of the largest nonprofit Catholic health systems in the United States. The facility uses Ascension's market-specific forms for the Florida panhandle region rather than purely facility-level documents. Two PDF forms were found during retrieval, along with references to a Swellbox-powered online records request portal and an Ascension patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Most Relevant Form

Three pathways exist for patients requesting their own records:

1. **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary): The facility's medical records page directs patients to a Swellbox-powered online request wizard — a third-party vendor platform purpose-built for patient record requests. This is the org's preferred channel.
2. **PDF authorization form (form-1.pdf)**: A traditional single-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Information From Ascension Sacred Heart," form number FFM99-8700-010-00 (rev 8/20). This is the general-purpose ROI form covering four Ascension Sacred Heart facilities in the Florida panhandle.
3. **Ascension patient portal**: The medical records page also references the patient portal for direct record access.

A second PDF (form-2.pdf) was found but is irrelevant for patient self-access — it is a department-specific inbound records release for the Radiation Oncology department, designed for transferring records *from* other providers *to* Sacred Heart. It uses outdated "Sacred Heart Health System" branding, contains multiple typos, and dates from 2016.

**Form-1 is the most relevant downloadable document** for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does not offer a dedicated patient-access PDF form distinct from third-party authorization. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed to cover all release scenarios — patients, insurers, attorneys, and other third parties all use the same document. A patient requesting their own records must check the "Patient Named Above" box to indicate they are both the patient and recipient, and select "At the request of the patient" as the purpose. This works but requires the patient to navigate a form designed for a broader audience.

However, the Swellbox online portal serves as a de facto dedicated patient access pathway. Online records request wizards are specifically designed for patient-initiated requests, providing a more guided experience than the generic PDF form. The existence of this portal partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient-access PDF.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. The primary PDF was discovered on the first web search using standard ROI-related keywords and downloaded without any bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or browser fallback requirements. The form is hosted on Ascension's content delivery system at a stable, descriptive URL. However, a patient navigating the website organically would be directed to the Swellbox portal rather than the PDF — the downloadable form is available but not prominently linked from the website's navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

**Technical format**: The PDF has a text layer (not a scan) but zero fillable/interactive fields. All blanks are underscores — patients must print and handwrite. Despite being digitally authored with 7 embedded fonts, it was designed entirely for a print-and-fill workflow.

**Layout and organization**: The single-page form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient information → purpose → format preference → report type checkboxes → facility/date selection → sensitive information authorization → legal disclosures → signature. The checkbox layout for report types and facility selection is clean and practical.

**Language**: The upper portion uses reasonably plain language. The lower third shifts to dense legal text — the sensitive information authorization bundles HIV, AIDS, psychiatric conditions, substance abuse, sickle cell anemia, STDs, and hepatitis into a single all-or-nothing binary decision in one long sentence. The revocation rights section runs together without paragraph breaks.

**Instructions**: Minimal. There are no instructions for how or where to submit the completed form. A note warns: "If you fail to specify which records you desire, you will only receive a copy of the discharge summary" — defaulting to minimal disclosure when patients don't navigate the checkbox list correctly.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number as a standard field — unnecessary for patient access and creates identity theft risk.
- **Purpose marked "REQUIRED"**: HIPAA does not require patients to state a reason for accessing their own records, though the pre-printed "At the request of the patient" option reduces the practical burden.
- **Default to minimal records**: The discharge-summary-only default if record types aren't specified may result in patients receiving less than they're entitled to.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. Patients have no advance notice of potential fees.
- **Internal EHR navigation paths visible**: Staff-facing filing instructions appear in the form footer, suggesting the document wasn't reviewed for patient-facing use.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox online portal as primary pathway**: Directing patients to a dedicated digital request wizard is a significant positive.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: One form covers four Ascension Sacred Heart locations — patients with care across facilities don't need separate forms.
- **Electronic format option**: The form offers a choice between electronic and paper delivery, though "electronic" is undefined.
- **Concise single-page design**: All content fits on one page without excessive cramming.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola provides a **mixed but functional** experience. The organization's strength lies in offering a Swellbox online portal as the primary pathway — a genuinely patient-centered digital option. However, the fallback PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, unnecessary SSN collection, and no submission instructions. The form is easy to find but was clearly designed for institutional workflow rather than patient self-service. A patient who uses the Swellbox portal will likely have a reasonable experience; one who downloads the PDF will face a traditional print-and-mail workflow with some compliance concerns.

# Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph offers two versions of the same general-purpose ROI authorization form (Form #3014) linked from different pages of its website. Form-1 (dated 03/28/2019) is the current version, found on the Health Information Management page under "Authorizations and Forms." Form-2 (dated 11/24/2015) is an older version linked from the Privacy Policy > HIPAA Authorization Form page. Both are flat (non-fillable) PDFs. A third version in .docx format with entirely outdated "Heartland Health" branding was also discoverable via web search. The organization additionally uses Epic MyChart as a patient portal, though the ROI forms make no mention of it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mosaic Life Care does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both form versions are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request to Another Agency," framing the process as a release of records to a third party. A patient wanting their own records must fill in themselves as both the requesting party and the recipient. While "Personal" appears among 12 purpose options, there is no language, section, or streamlined flow that addresses HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) as a distinct use case. The form does not reference the Right of Access by name, does not explain associated timelines or fee limits, and does not mention the patient portal as an alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were relatively easy to find — 2–3 clicks from the homepage via the HIM page. Site-specific search also surfaced the relevant pages. The main complication is fragmentation: two versions of the same form (same form number) are published simultaneously on different pages with no indication of which supersedes the other. This creates a risk that patients encounter the outdated 2015 version, which still references the organization's former name ("Heartland Regional Medical Center") in its legal disclaimer.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) has a text layer and is not a scan, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore placeholders, requiring the patient to print and handwrite responses. The 2-page form follows a logical flow (demographics → source facility → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature) and uses a two-column layout that makes efficient use of space. The 13-category record type checklist with an "Other" option provides granular control over what is released. However, the language mixes plain and legal styles, with the deceased-patient section and legal disclaimers being notably dense. The form requires a purpose selection ("must select one"), which is not required under HIPAA for patient self-access requests.

## Barriers and Notable Issues

No notarization is required. Forms can be submitted via email (ROI@myMLC.com), fax, or mail — multiple electronic submission channels are available, and in-person delivery is not required. However, form-1 says nothing about fees, while the older form-2 vaguely mentions records "may be subject to copying fees" without specifying amounts or HIPAA fee limits. No response time commitment is stated. The mandatory purpose field is a potential compliance concern for patient self-access requests. An "Identification type / Verified by" line on the form could mislead patients into thinking in-person ID verification is required, though the form can be submitted remotely.

## Strengths

The standout bright spot is the 15-language assistance notice on page 2 of form-1, covering an unusually comprehensive set of languages including Pennsylvania Dutch and Trukese — reflecting attention to local community demographics. The granular record type selection and multiple submission channels (email, fax, mail) are also positive features.

## Overall Assessment

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph provides a reasonably findable but fundamentally paper-oriented ROI process that funnels all requesters — including patients seeking their own records — through a generic third-party release authorization. The form quality is adequate with logical organization and good scope controls, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and missing fee/timeline information limit patient-centeredness. The organization earns a **C grade**, reflecting an acceptable but unremarkable approach to patient record access that meets minimum requirements without demonstrating meaningful investment in the patient self-access experience.

# Nemaha Valley Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital, an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Seneca, Kansas, provides two documents on its Resources page: an "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-2.pdf). The authorization form is the only mechanism available for patients to request their records. A Spanish-language version of the authorization form is also linked from the same page but was not separately downloaded for evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for disclosures to named third parties — a patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient and navigate fields (purpose, recipient address) that assume a third-party disclosure scenario. There is no mention of HIPAA § 164.524, no "right of access" language, and no separate pathway for individual access requests. The NPP, by contrast, does describe the right to inspect and obtain copies and even commits to providing records in electronic format upon request — but this information lives in a 12-page compliance document, not in the actual request form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) is accessible within two clicks from the homepage, and a site-scoped web search surfaced the link quickly. The page labels the form clearly as "Authorization for Release of Health Information." No bot blocking or access restrictions were encountered. General `filetype:pdf` searches did not return direct results, but this is a minor issue given how easily the form was found through site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a significant weakness. It is an **image-only scan** — a photocopy of a paper form scanned by a Savin copier in 2016, with zero extractable text, zero fillable fields, and no accessibility metadata. The revision date is January 2014, making it over a decade old. The form must be printed and filled out entirely by hand.

The layout is functional but dated, using a typewriter-style font with hand-drawn lines. Page 1 follows a logical sequence: patient identification, recipient designation, purpose, a 14-item record-type checklist, treatment date range, legal disclosures, and signature block. Page 2 is an internal cost-calculation worksheet that probably should not have been included in the patient-facing download — it shows per-page copy rates, labor charges, and staff-use fields for tracking releases. Both pages are erroneously labeled "Page 2 of 2."

The legal language is reasonably clear for a healthcare authorization form, but it is presented as dense paragraph text with no bold headings or visual breaks between disclosure sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable red flag is the **Social Security Number field**, which is prominently placed alongside name, birthdate, and MRN. SSN collection is unnecessary for medical records release and creates identity theft risk — especially concerning for a form that must be physically handled (printed, mailed, or hand-delivered).

The form provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address for the records department, no fax number, and no mention of email or portal submission. A patient would need to call the hospital to learn how to submit the completed form. The cost worksheet on page 2 references pick-up, mail, and fax as record delivery methods, suggesting fax capability exists, but no fax number is provided on the form itself.

Fees are very reasonable: $0.03 per page for copies, with a $3.90 per 15-minute labor charge. The per-page rate is well within HIPAA limits. The $10 charges for CDs and USB drives are dated but not egregious.

## Notable Strengths

Despite its weaknesses, the hospital has several bright spots. The availability of a **Spanish-language authorization form** is notable for a small rural hospital in Kansas. The **14-item record-type checklist** gives patients granular control over what is released. The **NPP is excellent** — recently updated (February 2026), it names a specific Privacy Officer with direct phone and email, commits to electronic format delivery, includes HIE participation transparency, and offers multilingual nondiscrimination taglines in 15+ languages. The contrast between the polished, current NPP and the decade-old scanned authorization form is striking.

## Overall Assessment

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital earns a **C grade**. The form is easy to find and fees are fair, but the core patient experience is undermined by an image-only scan that forces a fully paper-based workflow, a generic third-party authorization form with no patient access differentiation, an SSN field that creates unnecessary risk, and a complete absence of submission instructions. The hospital clearly has the capacity to produce quality digital documents (as evidenced by the NPP), but has not applied that capability to its records request process.

# Synthesis: Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center

## Overview

Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Far Rockaway, NY. Three documents were found on the organization's website: the primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a bilingual patient exit survey (form-2), and a general HIPAA consent/NPP acknowledgment form (form-3). Only form-1 functions as an actual records request authorization.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Addabbo does not offer a pathway designed specifically for patient self-access. The sole records request mechanism is **OCA Official Form No. 960**, a New York State standard "Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA." This is a general-purpose third-party authorization form — originally designed for litigation — that patients must repurpose when requesting their own records. The form includes "At request of individual" as one checkbox among several reasons for release, but it does not distinguish between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party seeking records. The instruction page explicitly states the form was designed for "release of health information needed for litigation in New York State courts" and "can, however, be used more broadly."

The form does not reference the patient's right to receive their own records, does not offer format or delivery options (electronic, paper, CD), and does not mention a patient portal. It collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient self-access and creates privacy risk.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. The organization's website has a dedicated Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`) accessible through the "For Patients" navigation menu. However, the forms are hosted on a third-party platform (Practice Builders / `pbformsonline.com`) via a JavaScript-based PDF viewer, requiring browser DevTools inspection to obtain the actual PDF download URL. A patient could fill the form within the embedded viewer, but downloading for offline completion requires technical sophistication.

A potential confusion point: the Patient Forms page labels form-3 as "HIPAA Consent to Release Information," which could mislead patients into downloading a registration consent form instead of the actual ROI authorization.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **fillable PDF** with 25 interactive fields, though none have accessible name attributes (degrading screen reader usability). The form is 2 pages — one page of authorization content and one page of litigation-context instructions. This is appropriately concise.

The form's structure front-loads six numbered legal disclosures (HIV redisclosure warnings, revocation rights, voluntariness) before any patient-fillable fields, creating a dense, legalistic opening. The language throughout is complex — written for attorneys, not patients. Item 6's all-caps restriction on discussing health information "WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SPECIFIED IN ITEM 9(b)" is confusing in a non-litigation context.

A notable bright spot: Addabbo added a **typed-signature acceptance clause**, allowing patients to complete and sign the form digitally without printing. This is a meaningful accommodation for remote submission. The form also provides a clear enumeration of what "entire medical record" includes and granular opt-in initialing for sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug treatment, mental health, HIV).

## Barriers

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number — unnecessary for patient self-access and a privacy risk.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. While this avoids imposing excessive fees, it also doesn't inform patients of their cost-limited rights.
- **No submission method specified on form**: The form itself does not indicate how to submit. The website context and Practice Builders platform provide some guidance, but submission via fax or in-person delivery appears to be expected.
- **Exit survey co-location**: The "We're Listening" exit survey (form-2) is posted alongside the ROI form on the Medical Records page, framing all records requests as patient transfers. If presented as a companion requirement, this could function as an implicit barrier. The survey contains pervasive Spanish translation errors.

## Bright Spots

- Typed-signature acceptance removes the print-sign-scan barrier
- Explicit enumeration of medical record contents gives patients clarity
- Granular sensitive-information opt-in via initialing
- Bilingual exit survey (despite translation quality issues) reflects community awareness
- Dedicated Medical Records page with direct link to the ROI form

## Overall Assessment

Addabbo provides a functional but imperfect pathway for patient records access. The organization relies on a state-standard litigation authorization form rather than creating a patient-centered access process. The form is fillable with typed-signature support — a meaningful digital accommodation — but the legalistic language, SSN collection, litigation framing, and lack of patient access rights language place the experience squarely in "adequate but not designed for you" territory. The retrieval experience is reasonable, though the third-party form hosting and confusingly labeled companion documents create unnecessary friction.

# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Newton-Wellesley Hospital (NWH) is a community hospital in Newton, MA, part of the Mass General Brigham (MGB) health system (formerly Partners HealthCare). For medical records requests, NWH uses the system-wide MGB authorization form rather than a facility-specific document. Two forms were found: the current MGB-branded authorization (form-1, dated 06/2024) and a legacy Partners HealthCare version (form-2, dated 01/2006) that remains accessible at an orphaned URL on nwh.org but is no longer linked from current navigation.

## Access Pathway

NWH does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary (and only current) form is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" designed to serve all release scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, and other recipients. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as someone authorizing release to a third party, selecting "Personal" as the purpose and checking a box to have records mailed to their own address. While functional, this approach requires patients to identify which sections apply to them and which to skip, without explicit guidance distinguishing patient access rights from third-party authorization.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. It frames the interaction as an "authorization" rather than a right, which is technically appropriate for third-party releases but conceptually misaligned for patient self-access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The NWH website provides a clear navigable path (Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records), though this redirects to the MGB parent system's medical records page where the user must expand a "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" accordion to access the download. This extra indirection is minor. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1) is a high-quality digital artifact. It features **78 fillable/interactive form fields** — checkboxes, text inputs, and date fields are all functional for on-screen completion. The form is organized into five clearly lettered sections (A through E) with a logical flow: patient info → permission/purpose → record types → sensitive information → understanding/signature. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The header prominently displays submission instructions (mailing address and fax number), and the form offers four delivery methods for the records themselves: Patient Gateway (portal), Secure Email, Fax, and Paper Copy via Mail. The inclusion of electronic delivery options is a notable strength.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though Section D (sensitive information authorization) contains dense regulatory text, particularly the 42 CFR Part 2 disclosure. This is legally required but not reader-friendly.

**Multilingual support** is a bright spot: the MGB medical records page offers the form in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

## Barriers

**Notarization**: Not required. Only a patient signature is needed.

**Fees**: The form subtly differentiates — copying fees are asterisked only for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes, while "Personal" and "Medical Care" are not marked, implying no fees for patient access requests. However, this is implicit rather than explicitly stated.

**Date requirement**: Section C states patients "MUST specify dates" (capitalized emphasis) for each record type category. HIPAA does not require patients to specify date ranges, and this requirement could function as a barrier for patients seeking comprehensive access to their records.

**Outside records carve-out**: Records from outside providers held by MGB will not be released unless the patient specifically requests them under "Other" — placing a knowledge burden on patients who may not know what outside records exist in their file.

## Strengths

- 78 fillable form fields enabling genuine digital completion
- Four delivery methods including portal and secure email
- Trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Portuguese)
- Implicit fee exemption for patient access requests
- Clean, well-organized layout with clear section headers
- Easy findability via web search or website navigation

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway; generic third-party authorization form only
- "MUST specify dates" requirement potentially exceeds HIPAA requirements
- No explicit statement of patient Right of Access
- Outside records require special knowledge to request
- Submission limited to fax or mail (no online form submission)

## Overall Assessment

Newton-Wellesley Hospital, through its parent system MGB, provides a technically well-executed authorization form that is easy to find and genuinely usable digitally. The form's 78 fillable fields, multilingual availability, and multiple delivery options represent above-average document quality. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, funneling all requestors through a generic authorization form. The "MUST specify dates" requirement and lack of Right of Access framing are missed opportunities to center the patient experience. Overall, this is a competent but generic approach — the form works, but it wasn't designed with the patient requesting their own records as the primary audience.

# Millinocket Regional Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Millinocket Regional Hospital provides a single downloadable PDF form: an **"Authorization to Release Health Care Information"** document hosted on its website since at least 2014. This is the only records-related form found for the organization. There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The sole pathway for a patient requesting records is to download this two-page PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — most likely via fax to the number listed in the form header ((207) 723-3019).

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

The form does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. It is structured entirely around a third-party disclosure model: the patient authorizes "Name of Institution" to disclose records to another "Name of Institution or Person." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. The "reason for release" field offers only "continuing care" or "other (please specify)" — there is no option for "personal records request" or "individual access under HIPAA." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form repurposed for all release scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required persistence. Two generic web searches returned no results; only a site-scoped query (`site:mrhme.org`) succeeded. The form does not appear to be prominently linked from a patient resources or medical records page. The URL path (`/2014/06/`) suggests the document has not been updated in over a decade. Once located, the download was straightforward — no bot blocking or browser fallback needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat PDF with zero fillable fields**. All data entry uses underscore blanks designed for handwriting. The document has a text layer (not a scan) and uses four fonts, but it is fundamentally a print-and-fill artifact. The layout lacks section headers, visual hierarchy, or any design elements beyond bold title text. Record types are presented as an 18-item list (a–r) using an unusual **opt-out approach**: items are released unless crossed out, which uses double-negative logic that could easily confuse patients.

The form covers patient identification, sender/recipient institution, record type selection, reason for release, sensitive information consent (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric), and signature lines — approximately 25 fields across two pages. The language is mostly plain but includes alarming legalese: *"refusal or revocation of permission may result in improper diagnosis or treatment, denial of health benefits or insurance, or other adverse consequences"* — a warning that applies to third-party release scenarios but could discourage a patient exercising their right of access.

## Barriers & Red Flags

The form mandates: *"All spaces on this form MUST be completed for this release to be valid."* This blanket requirement goes beyond HIPAA's authorization elements and could be used to reject forms with trivially missing information. A **witness signature line** is included; combined with the all-fields-mandatory language, this effectively requires a witness — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, no response time is stated, and no delivery format options are offered.

## Bright Spots

The **18-category record-type checklist** provides meaningful granularity, including unusual categories like "Patient Additions" and "Responses to Patients Additions." The **sensitive information consent sections** correctly reference redisclosure restrictions for substance abuse records under 42 CFR Part 2. The form does include a brief patient rights statement acknowledging the right to review records and revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Millinocket Regional Hospital's records request process reflects a facility that has not modernized its patient access pathway. A single generic third-party release form — non-fillable, hard to find, and over a decade old — serves as the only documented mechanism. The form was not designed for patient self-access and contains unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, all-fields-mandatory mandate). While fax submission is available and the form provides good record-type granularity, the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# UAB Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UAB Hospital (UAB Medicine), a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, provides one of the clearer patient record request experiences encountered in this study. The organization maintains a dedicated medical records request page that explicitly separates patient self-access from third-party release, offering distinct downloadable PDF forms for each pathway. Three forms were retrieved: a patient self-access form (form-1), a Callahan Eye Hospital variant (form-2), and a third-party authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

UAB Medicine stands out by offering a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-1, "Patient Request for Own Medical Records") that is clearly differentiated from its third-party authorization form (form-3). The patient access form opens with an explicit rights-affirming statement: *"UAB Medicine recognizes a patient's right to access their own protected health information."* The medical records request page at `uabmedicine.org/pay-your-bill/medical-records-request/` routes patients to the correct form based on their need — self-access versus third-party disclosure — with separate download links. This is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the UAB Medicine website clearly organizes its medical records page. The patient access form has a descriptive URL and filename (`Patient-Request-own-medical-records.pdf`), making it identifiable even in search results. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Quality: The Primary Patient Access Form (Form-1)

Form-1 is a 2-page fillable PDF with **51 interactive form fields**, clean text extraction, and a logical layout. The form is structured into clear sections: patient demographics, recipient designation, sensitive records opt-in, date range, record package selection, delivery method, and signature. The language is generally plain and direct, though the tiered package system requires some cognitive effort to parse.

A standout feature is the **five-tier record package system**, offering graduated levels of detail from key clinical notes through the entire medical record. This gives patients meaningful control over scope rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice. Additionally, nine individual record-type checkboxes allow specific requests (operative reports, billing records, medication list, radiology images, etc.).

**Delivery options** are comprehensive: paper mail, in-person pickup, fax, CD, and email. Electronic delivery includes a clear notice about encryption and privacy. For form submission, patients can return the completed form by mail or **fax (205-930-6721)**, providing an adequate electronic submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no notarization or witness requirements. No in-person submission is required. There are no excessive procedural hurdles — a patient signs once and does not need to initial multiple clauses (unlike form-2's three-initial requirement). However, **fees are not mentioned at all** — neither confirming free patient access nor disclosing a fee schedule. This silence creates ambiguity for patients who may reasonably want to know costs upfront. Similarly, **no turnaround time** is stated.

One ambiguity warrants mention: the form asks patients whether to include psychiatric/substance use records (opt-in checkbox on page 1) but then includes blanket authorization language covering those same records in the signature block on page 2, creating a potential contradiction.

## Contextual Notes on Other Forms

Form-2 (Callahan Eye Hospital variant) serves the same self-access function but is notably inferior: it has **zero fillable fields**, requires print-and-handwrite completion, and is 3 pages despite offering less content (2 record packages versus 5). Its title conflates "Patient Access" with "Authorization for Use or Disclosure," and it omits the rights-affirming opening statement present in form-1. It also contains a pagination error ("Page 3/2"). However, the high-watermark principle means UAB is assessed based on form-1, not this weaker variant.

Form-3 is correctly scoped as a third-party authorization and is appropriately separate from the patient access pathway. Its text layer is completely garbled due to CID font encoding issues, creating accessibility barriers, but this does not affect the patient self-access assessment.

## Overall Assessment

UAB Hospital delivers an above-average patient record request experience. The dedicated patient self-access form with rights-affirming language, fillable fields, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options — combined with a well-organized website that clearly separates patient access from third-party release — places this organization among the better performers. The primary gaps are the absence of fee disclosure and turnaround time information. The form is not cutting-edge (no online portal or digital submission), but the fillable PDF with fax submission represents a solid, accessible workflow.

# Fisher-Titus Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fisher-Titus Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Norwalk, Ohio. Three documents were downloaded from the organization's website: two versions of the same "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form (form-1.pdf revised 11/2024 and form-3.pdf revised 07/2025, both carrying form number FTC24-5) and an unrelated Emergency Medical Authorization form (form-2.pdf) for minor children. The relevant documents for patient self-access are the two ROI authorization forms, with form-3.pdf being the more current revision.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient Self-Access Accommodation

Fisher-Titus does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. Instead, it provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form that serves all release-of-information purposes — patient self-access, third-party releases to attorneys, insurers, and other providers alike. However, the form includes a notable accommodation: a **"Self (same info as above)" checkbox** in the recipient section (Section 2), which explicitly lets patients indicate they are requesting their own records without having to fill out a separate recipient name and address. A "Personal" purpose option in Section 4 further supports this use case.

Despite these accommodations, the form's framing — titled "Authorization to Disclose PHI" — and its overall design orient around third-party disclosure. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access, no plain-language explanation of patient rights, and no guidance distinguishing the patient self-access process from a third-party release. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different primary audience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. It is reachable within two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Guests → Patient Forms) and is also available on a dedicated Medical Records page (/medical-records). No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-rendered links were encountered. URLs are descriptively named. The two independent navigation paths to the form are above average for a community hospital. One confusing element: the Patient Forms page links to the older revision (form-1.pdf) while the Medical Records page links to the newer revision (form-3.pdf), with no indication to the patient which version is current.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-3.pdf, revised 07/2025) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with extractable text. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as typographic underscores, and checkboxes are non-interactive Unicode characters. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand or use a PDF annotation tool. This is a print-first design distributed digitally.

The form's structure is well-organized with **eight clearly numbered sections** following a logical progression: patient info → recipient → treatment location → purpose → record types → format/delivery → sensitive information consent → expiration/signature. Section 5 provides impressively granular record selection with approximately 17 specific record type checkboxes (discharge summaries, H&P, operative reports, lab, pathology, radiology images, immunizations, ED records, etc.), each with date fields. Patients can request their entire record or specific items.

The language is **moderately clear** — section headers are descriptive and the flow is intuitive, but legal boilerplate in Sections 7 and 8 uses complex sentence structures typical of authorization forms. A patient of average literacy could complete the form, though the dense Section 5 and legal consent language may slow them down. Approximately 20–25 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN requested**: Section 1 asks for "SS#" (Social Security Number), which is unnecessary for patient access under HIPAA and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Witness Signature" line appears at the bottom with no explanation of when or whether a witness is required, potentially deterring patients who lack a convenient witness.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: The form states Fisher-Titus "may charge a fee" but provides no fee schedule, amounts, or indication of whether patient self-access requests are free.
- **Two conflicting versions online**: The older and newer revisions differ in content (sensitive information categories, specialty office listings) but share the same form number, risking patient confusion.

## Bright Spots

- **Encrypted email as a delivery format**: Fisher-Titus offers encrypted email alongside CD, flash drive, and paper for records delivery — a progressive option for a community hospital.
- **Granular record selection**: The 17+ record type checkboxes with date fields give patients fine-grained control over their request scope.
- **"Self" checkbox**: The explicit self-request accommodation, while not a dedicated patient form, reduces friction compared to forms that only contemplate third-party recipients.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Fax numbers are listed for each treatment location, and mail and in-person options are available — ensuring patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fisher-Titus Medical Center provides an accessible, reasonably well-designed records request process hampered by a print-only form design and a generic authorization framework that does not truly center patient self-access. The form is easy to find, logically organized, and offers progressive delivery options including encrypted email. However, the lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of patient rights language or fee transparency pull the overall experience down. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience with that patient in mind as the primary audience.

# Colquitt Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Colquitt Regional Medical Center (Moultrie, GA) is an independent, government-owned community hospital. The organization offers a single downloadable PDF form for medical records requests, found on its Health Records & Patient Portal page. No online portal, patient portal integration, or alternative digital pathway was identified for requesting records.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was retrieved: an "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for releasing records to third parties. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a patient portal–based records request workflow. The sole pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — though the form itself provides no submission instructions (no fax number, mailing address, or email).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as an authorization for disclosure to a named recipient (item 5 asks for recipient "Name" and "Address"). While item 6 includes a "my personal records" purpose checkbox — a helpful nod toward self-access — the form does not explain what a patient should enter as the recipient when requesting their own records. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of patient access rights, and no separate pathway or instructions for patients who simply want their own medical records. A patient must navigate a form designed for third-party release and adapt it to their self-access needs.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped search quickly identified the Health Records & Patient Portal page, and the form was linked with a clearly labeled "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button — approximately two clicks from the homepage. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy**, and no bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page scanned image** with no meaningful text layer (only 11 characters of noise extracted) and zero fillable fields. It was created in 2021 using scanning software ("Transform Foundation Server"), confirming it is a digitized paper form rather than a digitally authored document. The form is completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology, cannot be filled digitally, and must be printed and completed by hand.

Despite the poor technical quality, the content design is adequate. The 10-item numbered list provides a logical flow: patient identification → who may disclose → record types → sensitive information acknowledgment → recipient → purpose → legal terms → signatures. Twelve record-type checkboxes offer useful granularity. The language mixes plain English with some legal phrasing — mostly readable but occasionally dense (e.g., the revocation paragraph). There are no section headers, boxes, or visual groupings to aid navigation, but the single-page length keeps complexity manageable.

## Barriers

- **No submission instructions**: The form contains no fax number, mailing address, email, or department name. A patient downloading the form has no guidance on how to return it. The website's Health Records page may provide this information, but it is absent from the form itself.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" line is present, which may lead patients to believe a witness is required — HIPAA does not require this for patient access requests.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form makes no mention of fees or costs for records.
- **No date range field**: Patients cannot specify a time period for the records they want.
- **No delivery format options**: No choices for electronic vs. paper delivery.

## Bright Spots

- **Easy findability**: The form was prominently linked from a clearly labeled page.
- **Voluntariness statement**: Item 10 explicitly states that signing is voluntary and will not affect treatment.
- **Patient-controlled expiration**: Item 8 lets the patient set their own authorization expiration date.
- **"My personal records" purpose checkbox**: While the form is generic, this option at least acknowledges that patients may be requesting their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Colquitt Regional Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request pathway. The form is easy to find, but it is a scanned image that cannot be filled digitally, lacks submission instructions, and does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The technical quality is poor — an image-only scan with no fillable fields and no accessibility support. A patient attempting to request their own records faces a form not designed for their use case, must print and handwrite their responses, and receives no guidance on how to submit the completed form. The organization earns credit for findability and a few patient-friendly touches (voluntariness statement, patient-controlled expiration), but the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# Sea Mar Community Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Sea Mar Community Health Centers is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Seattle, WA. The organization publishes a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — that serves as the only downloadable pathway for patients requesting their own records. Sea Mar also offers a patient portal (MyChart) at seamar.org/ohr/index.php, though this was not evaluated as part of the form retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Sea Mar does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios — transfer of care, third-party release, and patient-initiated requests alike. The "Purpose of the release" section includes "At my request" as one option alongside "Transfer of Care" and "Verbal Disclosure," but there is no separate patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no mention of the specific protections that apply to individual access requests (fee limits, format choice, 30-day timeline). A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form that treats their legally-distinct right as just another checkbox on a general authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned a direct link to the PDF on the first attempt, and a site-scoped search confirmed no other ROI forms exist. There was no bot blocking, login wall, or CAPTCHA. The URL (`seamar.org/dl/ROI%20COPY%202022%20PDF.pdf`) uses the acronym "ROI" which patients are unlikely to recognize, but the form was immediately discoverable through search engines. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations make their forms far harder to find.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page PDF with a text layer (not a scanned image), but it has **zero fillable fields**. All entries use underscores and blank lines designed for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and return it — there are no interactive checkboxes, text inputs, or digital signature fields. The form cannot be completed digitally without third-party PDF annotation tools.

The layout is structured with labeled sections on the left side (Patient Information, From, To, Information to be released, etc.) following a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the single-page compression creates density issues with minimal whitespace. The language mixes plain directions with legal terminology — the reference to "Title 42 of the United States code" is imprecise (it should cite 42 CFR Part 2 specifically) and provides no actionable information to patients.

The instruction "Please initial one section" under record types is confusing — there are actually six initialing options, some of which patients might logically want to combine. The "All records" option excludes sensitive information without clearly cross-referencing the separate sensitive information section below, creating a two-step requirement that patients could easily miss.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is the **apparent requirement for in-person submission**. The form lists delivery methods for receiving records (In-Clinic, Verbal, CD, Paper, Fax) but provides no mailing address, fax number, or email address for submitting the completed form. The "Staff Use Only" section — with checkboxes for "Verified all sections are complete" and staff initials — strongly implies the form is designed to be completed in-clinic, in front of staff. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeline is stated. The 90-day default expiration is reasonable for a third-party authorization but conceptually irrelevant for a patient access request, since the right of access is ongoing.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular record type options**: The "Recent summary of care" itemizes specific components (Medication List, Problem List, Progress Notes, Imaging, Immunizations, screening results), giving patients a clear picture of what they'll receive.
- **Minor consent section**: A well-structured section for minors ages 13–17 to authorize release of sensitive information, with age thresholds aligned to Washington State's mature minor doctrine.
- **Easy discoverability**: The form was found on the first search attempt with no access barriers.
- **Patient rights statement**: Present, though generic — covers revocation right and no-conditioning, but does not reference individual access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Sea Mar provides a functional but paper-centric, undifferentiated pathway for patient record access. The form is easy to find online but impossible to complete digitally, and the apparent in-person submission requirement creates a meaningful barrier. The conflation of patient self-access with third-party authorization means patients receive no information about their specific rights under HIPAA's Right of Access. For an FQHC serving diverse communities, the absence of a Spanish-language version and the lack of any digital workflow are notable gaps.

# Hendrick Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hendrick Health, a nonprofit regional hospital system based in Abilene, TX, provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records requests — one for the hospital arm (Hendrick Medical Center, including South and Brownwood campuses) and one for the outpatient clinic arm (Hendrick Clinic). Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information, not dedicated patient self-access request forms. No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Hendrick Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting disclosure. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information (PHI)" and frame the transaction as a release between two named parties. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name in the "authorize" blank and again in the "who can receive" section — a workflow designed for attorneys, insurers, and other requestors, not for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The forms do include "Personal Use" as one of seven disclosure reasons, which accommodates patient self-access, but it is not highlighted or explained. There is no mention of the patient's Right of Access, no fee limitation language, and no stated response timeline.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Standard web searches immediately surfaced the Medical Records page (hendrickhealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/), which links directly to both PDFs with clear descriptions. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, login wall, or browser automation was required. The URLs are descriptive and stable. This is a findability bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1 (hospital)** is the stronger of the two forms and represents the best available pathway. It is a single-page flat PDF (zero fillable fields) with a text layer — digitally created from a Word document but exported without interactive form fields. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit via fax (325-670-6538), mail, email, or in-person pickup. The Hendrick Service Center address and contact information are pre-populated, reducing patient guesswork.

The form is organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → sensitive record initials → reason for disclosure → legal text → party identification → signatures. Record type granularity is a strength, with 16+ specific checkboxes plus an "all health information" option. However, the legal text in the lower third is dense, small-font legalese citing Texas Health & Safety Code § 181.154(c) and 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(1). No plain-language summary of patient rights is provided.

**Form-2 (clinic)** is structurally identical but notably weaker: it omits the email delivery option, lacks pre-filled contact information (leaving patients unsure where to submit), and omits a dates-of-service field. Patients who received care at both hospital and clinic entities would need to complete two separate forms with no cross-referencing guidance.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization, witness, or in-person submission is required — these are positive absences. Fees are not mentioned at all (neither disclosed nor waived). The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is unnecessary for HIPAA-compliant record identification but is a minor rather than severe barrier.

Both forms misspell "HIPAA" as "HIPPA" — a factual error that appears in the opening paragraph and undermines credibility. Form-2's PDF metadata exposes internal document management details ("Page 2__05.2022 MASTER-Authorization to Obtain or Release PHI- - Copy.docx"), suggesting careless export. The title of form-1 ("Authorization to Release Health Information") contradicts its subtitle ("Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information"), creating directional confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery** on the hospital form is uncommon and provides a digital delivery pathway
- **Pre-populated facility contact information** on form-1 reduces patient burden
- **Granular record selection** gives patients meaningful control over what is released
- **Single-page format** keeps the form manageable despite dense content

## Overall Assessment

Hendrick Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find and free of major barriers, but the organization channels all requestors — patients, attorneys, insurers — through the same generic authorization form without acknowledging that patient self-access is a distinct right with different rules. The flat, non-fillable PDFs represent a missed opportunity for digital-first design, and the split between hospital and clinic forms adds unnecessary complexity. A patient can get their records here without undue hardship, but the process was clearly not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Guthrie Corning Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Guthrie Corning Hospital is a community hospital in Corning, NY, operating within the Guthrie Clinic regional health system. All medical records forms are published at the system level by Guthrie Clinic and apply uniformly across its facilities (Corning, Troy, Cortland, Robert Packer, and Towanda Campus). Three documents were found: a general-purpose ROI authorization form (form-1), a family/friends access authorization (form-2), and a companion instruction sheet with fees and contact information (form-3).

## Best Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1**, the "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form — it serves all release purposes (provider-to-provider, legal, insurance, personal use) rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient must select "Personal Use" from a list of purpose options alongside "Legal," "Insurance," and "Lay Caregiver." The form does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508. Form-2 (family access) is irrelevant for patient self-access. Form-3 (instructions) supplements form-1 with submission details and fees.

The instruction sheet mentions that "Continuation of care requests may also be completed thru your individual eGuthrie/MyChart account," hinting at a patient portal pathway, but no detail is provided and this does not appear to cover general patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were **easy to find**. A basic web search immediately returned the PDF, and the Guthrie website's medical records page (guthrie.org/medical-records) serves as a well-organized hub. No bot blocking, JavaScript barriers, or login was required. All three documents were directly downloadable.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF**. It has zero interactive fields — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. Despite being digitally authored (not a scan), it was designed as a print-and-fill document with blank lines and empty checkbox squares rather than interactive elements. The form uses 9 fonts and has a dense layout that packs patient demographics, facility selection, record type checkboxes, format options, recipient information, purpose, rights statements, sensitive information opt-outs, and signature into one page. This compression keeps the form brief but makes it visually crowded.

The form's organization is logical: numbered sections flow from facility selection through record types, format, recipient, purpose, rights, expiration, and sensitive information. Language is moderately legalistic — phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" use distancing third-person framing. The instruction to "Read Entire Document Before Signing" is helpful but insufficient as the only guidance on the form itself.

Notable content features include three format options (Paper Copy, Electronic CD/DVD, Electronic On-Line) and granular record type selection (discharge summary, H&P, operative report, radiology by modality, etc.), giving patients meaningful control.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees** are transparent: the companion instruction sheet states a $6.50 flat rate for personal-use electronic records (HIPAA-compliant) and explicitly notes no charge for provider-to-provider transfers. This fee transparency, while not on the form itself, is better than most organizations.

**Submission** is available by mail, fax, or in-person — fax provides an adequate electronic submission channel. No online or email submission is available.

**No notarization** is required. The form does request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary and may deter privacy-conscious patients. The sensitive information default is opt-out (drug/alcohol, HIV, mental health records are released unless the patient checks boxes to exclude them), which is less protective than an opt-in approach. Genetic information is mentioned with no opt-out at all.

Corning Hospital patients face a geographic nuance: the instruction sheet notes "No onsite support" for Corning, directing patients to contact Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA, and mail forms to that address. This could be disorienting for local patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Excellent findability with a well-organized central medical records page
- Single-page form keeps burden low
- Clear fee transparency with HIPAA-compliant pricing
- Granular record type and format selection including electronic options
- System-wide forms eliminate confusion across facilities

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable/interactive fields despite being a digitally-created PDF
- Generic authorization form with no dedicated patient access pathway
- No reference to patient's right of access under HIPAA
- Sensitive information defaults to release (opt-out rather than opt-in)
- Critical information (fees, submission addresses, fax numbers) split across a separate document
- No onsite medical records support at Corning Hospital itself

## Overall Assessment

Guthrie Corning Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find, the fee structure is transparent and compliant, and the single-page format keeps patient burden manageable. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization approach that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, and the reliance on a print-handwrite-fax workflow place it squarely in the middle tier of organizations studied. The process works, but it was not designed with the patient as the primary user.

# Shannon Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Shannon Health, a nonprofit regional health system in San Angelo, TX, provides a single Authorization for Release of Information (ROI) form for all records requests. The form is available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful accommodation for the area's large Hispanic population. While the form is easy to find and includes several patient-friendly features, it follows the common pattern of routing patient self-access requests through a generic third-party release authorization rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Forms & Pathways

Shannon Health offers two downloaded documents, but they are functionally one form in two languages:

- **form-1.pdf** (English): "Authorization for Release of Information," revised 06/2024
- **form-2.pdf** (Spanish): "Autorización para la Divulgación de Información," identical structure

The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-1.pdf (English). The form includes a "Self" checkbox under the recipient field and "Personal Use" among purpose options, acknowledging patient access as a use case. However, the form's structure — with fields for recipient organization, address, phone, fax, and relationship — assumes a third-party release scenario. A patient requesting their own records must navigate these irrelevant fields, with no guidance on how to handle them when "Self" is selected.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal for record requests, and no separate streamlined process for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The website's navigation path — **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** — leads directly to a page with clearly labeled download links for both language versions. This is a 2-click path from the homepage. One minor friction point: web search results initially returned outdated URLs (`medical-record-authorization.pdf`) that produced 404 errors. The filenames were updated for 2025 without redirects, creating link rot. Navigating the website directly resolved this.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores for handwriting; no checkboxes are interactive. For a form dated 2025, this is a significant missed opportunity. Patients must print the PDF, hand-fill all fields, then scan or photograph it for electronic submission.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → substance use disorder options → format → legal terms → signature → return instructions. The flow is intuitive, and the form uses reasonably clear language, though page 2's legal disclosures are denser. The form provides granular control over record scope with approximately 15 record type checkboxes, a date range field, and hospital/clinic selection. The three-option handling of substance use disorder records (include all, exclude all, select specific) is well-designed.

Approximately 25 fields require completion, which is proportionate for a general-purpose ROI form but more than a dedicated patient access form would need.

## Barriers

**Fees**: The form states fees "may" be charged and requires the patient to "agree to pay accordingly" — without disclosing amounts or referencing applicable fee limits. This vague blanket acceptance is the most significant concern; a patient has no idea what they're agreeing to.

**No notarization or witness** required. **No in-person submission** required — email is explicitly listed as the "Preferred Method" via `ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org`. Mail and in-person delivery are also available. No fax submission is listed, but email more than compensates.

**Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) linked side-by-side on the records page — appropriate for San Angelo's demographics (~45% Hispanic)
- **Email as the preferred submission method** — unusually patient-friendly; most orgs default to fax or mail
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: MyChart portal access and encrypted email via ShareFile, in addition to paper, CD, pick-up, and mail
- **Non-conditioning disclosure**: Explicitly states Shannon cannot condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on signing the authorization — an important HIPAA protection many forms omit
- **Substance use disorder records handling**: Three clear options giving patients granular control over sensitive information

## Overall Assessment

Shannon Health delivers an above-average but not exceptional patient experience. The form is easy to find, reasonably well-designed, and submitted through a patient-friendly email channel. The bilingual offering and electronic delivery options are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (funneling patients through a generic third-party authorization), the absence of fillable fields in a 2025-edition form, and the vague fee disclosure prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process wasn't designed with that use case as the primary concern.

# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center provides three downloadable documents, but only one is relevant for patient self-access: **form-3.pdf**, the current "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (CONS00337, dated LRH 01/22). This single-page PDF is linked from the organization's [Medical Records page](https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/) and is the actively maintained ROI form. An older version of the same form (form-1.pdf, dated 04/16) remains publicly accessible at a separate URL but is no longer linked from the site. The third document (form-2.pdf) is an LRH Physicians Group Release/Authorization Form — a multi-purpose intake/consent bundle covering insurance assignment, billing, and treatment consent — and is not a patient-initiated records request form.

In addition to the PDF form, the organization offers a **Swellbox digital intake wizard** (http://www.swellbox.com/lakeland-wizard.html) as an alternative electronic pathway, which is a meaningful digital option for patients who prefer not to deal with paper.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lakeland Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (form-3) is a generic HIPAA authorization with bidirectional language — "to disclose my PHI to" and "to obtain my PHI from" — using checkboxes for each direction. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should check "to disclose my PHI to" and enter their own name and address as the recipient, an unintuitive workflow. There is no dedicated patient access form, no simplified request pathway, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). The form treats patient self-access identically to third-party release, including applying the same fee structure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Lakeland Regional Health medical records release form returned direct PDF links immediately, and the Medical Records page is straightforward to locate via site navigation. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor concern is that the superseded 2016 version remains publicly accessible without any "outdated" marking, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-3) is a **clean, digitally-authored single-page PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is logical and reasonably organized, flowing from patient identification through recipient details, date range, delivery method, record type checkboxes (13 categories plus "Other"), sensitive information notice, five legal clauses, and signature blocks. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — the numbered "I understand that..." clauses are reasonably accessible, though the fee reference to Florida statutes without disclosing actual amounts is opaque.

Three delivery options are offered: Paper, Electronic (email), and MyChart Patient Portal — a forward-thinking inclusion. The form provides granular record-type selection with 13 specific categories, and includes a patient-protective redaction option for mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records.

## Barriers

**Fee disclosure** is a notable weakness: patients must "agree to pay charges... per Florida Statute 395.3025 or Florida Administrative Code 64B8-10.003" without knowing what those charges are. This state fee schedule reference may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests, and the form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release fee structures.

A **witness signature line** appears on the form without clear indication of whether it is required or optional. If required, this creates a logistical barrier for patients completing the form at home or remotely. The form also collects the **last four digits of SSN**, which is unnecessary when MRN, name, DOB, and address are already requested. A "Photo ID verified" checkbox is ambiguous — if interpreted as requiring in-person ID presentation, it could conflict with electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Swellbox digital intake** provides a fully electronic alternative pathway
- **MyChart Patient Portal** as a delivery option leverages existing infrastructure
- **Granular record-type selection** (13 categories) gives patients meaningful control
- **Sensitive information redaction option** with explicit notice is a patient-protective feature
- **Single-page conciseness** keeps the form efficient and reduces patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Lakeland Regional Health provides a **serviceable but undifferentiated** records request experience. The form is easy to find, concise, and reasonably well-organized, with some genuinely patient-friendly features (granular record selection, redaction option, MyChart delivery). However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access, failing to disclose fees, and including potentially unnecessary requirements (witness, partial SSN). The availability of Swellbox as a digital alternative partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF, but the core form experience remains paper-first. The organization earns credit for accessibility and findability but loses ground on patient-centeredness and compliance nuances.

# Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cottage Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Woodsville, NH, affiliated with the Rowe Health Center outpatient clinic. Two documents were retrieved: a standalone one-page "Authorization for Disclosure of Medical Information" (form-1) and a 12-page "RHC New Patient Packet" (form-2) containing a variant authorization form on page 2. Neither document is a dedicated patient access request form; both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was exceptionally difficult. The hospital's website (cottagehospital.org) is protected by Cloudflare Turnstile, which blocked all automated access — curl, browser with DevTools, and even Google's cache were inaccessible. The forms were ultimately recovered only through the Wayback Machine using archived snapshots from July 2024. Notably, the current versions of both documents (updated in 2024) were not captured by the Wayback Machine, meaning only older versions could be evaluated. A dedicated HIM department page exists on the site but could not be verified due to the access barrier. The form was linked from a "Becoming a Rowe Health Center Patient" page — framing the authorization as part of new-patient onboarding rather than a standalone records-request process.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Cottage Hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access form. Both retrieved documents are generic HIPAA authorization forms. Form-1's operative language — "authorize Cottage Hospital to use or disclose my protected health information to [other entity]" — is oriented entirely toward third-party release, with no clear mechanism for a patient to request records for themselves.

Form-2's page-2 authorization makes a meaningful improvement: it distinguishes "Self or Representative" from "Other Provider or Facility" as separate recipient categories, with different scope rules for each. Copies to patients default to "Complete copy of medical record, excluding psychotherapy notes," while third-party copies offer more granular selection. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot, showing intentional thought about different use cases. However, this better version is buried on page 2 of a 12-page new patient packet, which a patient searching for a records release form would have no reason to download based on the filename alone.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form has interactive/fillable fields despite both being digitally created in Microsoft Word. Patients must print and complete them by hand. Form-1 is a single page with approximately 12 fields — a manageable scope. The layout follows a logical flow (identification → recipient → record types → legal disclosures → signature), but lacks section headers or visual separators. Legal disclosures run as a continuous block of dense text with sentences exceeding 50 words. The form uses 5 fonts for a single page, and its footer reads "PAGE 14 OF 28" — a vestige of the larger policy document it was extracted from, which is confusing.

Both forms include confusing remuneration fields ("direct or indirect remuneration in the form of [describe]") that are required by HIPAA only for sale-of-PHI authorizations but will mystify patients making routine requests.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the complete absence of submission instructions on either form. No mailing address (beyond the hospital header), no fax number, no email, no mention of the HIM department as a submission point. A patient who completes the form has no guidance on how to deliver it. The witness signature line, while not explicitly marked as required, may lead patients to believe a witness is needed — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, and no response time is stated.

## Notable Strengths

The non-conditioning statement ("I MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION FORM") is prominently displayed in caps. Psychotherapy notes are properly segregated per 45 CFR § 164.508(b)(3)(ii). The 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure warning for substance abuse records is correctly included. Form-2's welcome letter is genuinely warm and accessible, and its billing section proactively discloses a 44% community health discount for self-pay patients.

## Red Flags

Form-2's General Consent for Treatment (Section 11) contains a blanket authorization allowing Cottage Hospital to disclose records "at its discretion" to any party liable for hospital charges, explicitly including substance abuse, psychiatric, and HIV records. This extremely broad authorization is bundled into routine intake paperwork, raising informed-consent concerns.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Hospital provides a minimally functional records release process that requires significant patient initiative to navigate. The Cloudflare-protected website, non-fillable forms, absence of submission instructions, and generic third-party framing create a cumulative experience that falls short of patient-centered design. The partial self-access accommodation in form-2 and proper HIPAA compliance language prevent the assessment from being worse, but this is a facility where requesting your own records would require calling the hospital for basic instructions.

# Natividad Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Natividad Medical Center, a government-owned community hospital in Salinas, CA, hosts two ROI authorization forms on its medical records page at `https://www.natividad.com/medical-records/`:

- **Form 1** (2019): A 1-page "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — an image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields. Despite being the newer version, it is a grayscale scan at 200 DPI that cannot be read by screen readers or completed digitally.
- **Form 2** (2007): A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" created from Microsoft Word. It has a text layer but is copy-protected (RC4 encryption) and also lacks fillable fields. It requests Social Security Number and contains a garbled legal citation.

Both forms serve the same general purpose — authorizing release of health information — and both remain linked from the website with no guidance on which is current or preferred.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. However, Form 1 does include explicit patient access language: "If you are the patient requesting your own records, you may choose between printed copies or CD." It also includes a "Patient" checkbox among requester roles. Form 2 has a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose but is structurally oriented toward third-party release, requiring the patient to name a "release to" recipient — awkward when requesting one's own records.

The organization does not differentiate individual access from third-party authorization through separate forms, sections, or pathways. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. A general web search for medical records release forms surfaced both PDFs, and a site-specific search confirmed the medical records page. The presence of two overlapping forms with unclear currency creates confusion — a patient finding both would not know which to use. The filename "Auth_ROI_e.pdf" for Form 2 is cryptic and unhelpful. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form is fillable — both require printing and completion by hand. Form 1's image-only format makes it completely inaccessible to assistive technology, likely violating Section 508 and WCAG standards for a government facility. Form 2's text layer is an improvement but copy-protection prevents text selection. Both forms use underscore-line blanks for data entry.

Form 1 packs substantial content onto a single page with cramped layout. Section headings exist but are not strongly differentiated from body text in the scanned format. Form 2 is better organized with clear section headers (USE AND DISCLOSURE, PURPOSE, EXPIRATION, MY RIGHTS, SIGNATURE) and logical flow across two pages, though footnotes descend into dense legal prose.

Language is generally plain in both forms, though both include legal phrasing that may challenge patients with limited health literacy. Neither form provides clear instructions for completion.

## Barriers

- **No electronic submission pathway documented**: Neither form specifies how to submit — no fax number, email address, or portal is mentioned. The forms only address what information to release, not how to submit the request.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate charges.
- **Outdated delivery options**: Form 1 states "Natividad policy is to provide all electronic records on a CD" — CDs are increasingly obsolete, and this may functionally limit patients' right to receive records electronically.
- **SSN collection** (Form 2): Requesting Social Security Number is unnecessary for HIPAA requests and creates identity-theft risk.
- **Blank revocation address** (Form 2): The form instructs patients to submit revocations "to the following address" but leaves the address blank.

## Bright Spots

- Form 1 explicitly addresses patients requesting their own records and offers format choices.
- Form 1's opt-out exclusion model (defaulting to full disclosure with options to exclude HIV, substance abuse, mental health records) is patient-friendly.
- Form 1 dropped the SSN requirement present in Form 2, showing incremental improvement.
- Both forms include patient rights language covering refusal, no-retaliation, revocation, and right to a copy.

## Overall Assessment

Natividad Medical Center provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly maintained patient access experience. The organization relies on generic third-party authorization forms rather than a dedicated patient access pathway. The newer form (2019) is paradoxically less accessible than the older one (2007) due to its image-only scan format — a regression in digital accessibility. Neither form is fillable, no electronic submission method is documented, and the dual-form situation with no guidance creates unnecessary confusion. For a government-owned facility, the accessibility failures are particularly concerning. The org earns a **C grade**, reflecting a process that technically exists but was not designed with patient self-access in mind.

# El Centro de Corazón — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

El Centro de Corazón is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Houston, Texas. It offers a single downloadable PDF form for health information disclosure — a bilingual (English/Spanish) "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information." This form is the only pathway available for patients seeking their own medical records, and it is oriented entirely toward third-party release of information rather than patient self-access.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page authorization for disclosure hosted on the organization's WordPress site. Page 1 is in English, page 2 is a Spanish translation. No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified. The form's fax number (713-926-9105) is printed on the document, suggesting fax is an accepted submission method, though this is not explicitly stated as a submission instruction. No email, portal, or other electronic submission options are mentioned.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

El Centro de Corazón does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses a "provide to / receive from (circle one)" structure that presumes records flow between El Centro and another entity. There is no "send records to me, the patient" option. Among the nine reason-for-disclosure checkboxes (Continuing of Care, Financial Insurance Verification, Legal Proceedings, etc.), none corresponds to "personal/patient request." A patient wanting their own records must use the "Other (Specify)" write-in, which is unintuitive and signals that patient self-access was not a design consideration.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), does not include any patient rights language, and does not ask how the patient would like to receive their records (mail, electronic, in-person pickup). This is a generic HIPAA authorization form pressed into service for all disclosure scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned a direct link to the PDF on El Centro's WordPress site. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication was encountered. The URL structure (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/...`) is a standard WordPress media path — functional but not linked from a clearly labeled "Medical Records" or "Patient Resources" page. The form appears to date from August 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive form fields). It must be printed and completed by hand — the design uses underscore-line blanks and a "circle one" instruction that are hallmarks of print-era forms. The text layer is present (not a scan), so the content is readable and searchable, but there is no digital-first workflow available.

**Field count** is modest: patient name, DOB, phone number, the other party's information, reason checkboxes, information-type checkboxes, a sensitive-information acknowledgment, and signature/date fields — roughly 12–15 fields per language. At one page per language, the form is compact and not overwhelming.

**Layout** is functional but dense. Section headers are minimal; the form flows as a single block of content. Language is relatively plain, though legal constructs appear ("I hereby authorize"). A grammatical error exists in both versions regarding re-disclosure language.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Witness signature line**: Present on both English and Spanish versions. HIPAA does not require a witness for authorization forms. While the line appears optional (no mandatory language), its presence may lead staff to enforce it as required, creating an unnecessary barrier.
- **Fee disclosure**: Vague — "I understand that I may be charged for the copies of health records I have requested" — with no specifics about amounts, HIPAA cost-based limits, or dispute processes.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization defaults to 90 days, which is reasonable for third-party disclosures but irrelevant for patient access requests (which must be fulfilled within 30 days).
- **No delivery format options**: The form does not ask how the patient wants to receive records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual (English/Spanish)**: Providing a full Spanish translation on the same document is a meaningful accessibility feature for an FQHC serving Houston's predominantly Spanish-speaking communities. This is uncommon and commendable.
- **Compact design**: One page per language avoids the multi-page complexity that discourages completion.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient self-access pathway**: The form's entire structure is oriented toward third-party disclosure. A patient exercising their Right of Access is a second-class user.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive fields; purely a print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Checkbox mismatch**: The Spanish version omits "Billing Records" as a checkbox option, creating a translation inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

El Centro de Corazón provides a findable, compact, bilingual form — but it is a generic third-party authorization that does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The non-fillable format, lack of patient rights language, ambiguous witness requirement, and vague fee disclosure all contribute to a below-average patient experience. The bilingual design is a genuine bright spot that partially offsets the form's structural shortcomings.

# Desert Valley Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Valley Hospital (DVH) is a for-profit community hospital in Victorville, CA, part of the Prime Healthcare system. A patient attempting to request their own medical records online faces significant barriers: DVH's website describes the records request process but provides no downloadable authorization form. The only usable patient-facing form was found on a sister Prime Healthcare hospital's website (Chino Valley Medical Center), using a system-wide template that DVH presumably also uses but has not published.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved during an exhaustive search:

1. **Form-2 (PHSI-280-014 CVMC)** — the most relevant document. A 2-page general HIPAA authorization form from Chino Valley Medical Center, a Prime Healthcare sister hospital. This system-wide template is the standard patient ROI form across Prime Healthcare facilities. It has 47 fillable fields, granular record-type selection, and a clear patient rights section. However, it is branded for CVMC, not DVH.

2. **Form-1 (PHSI-320-012)** — an employee-only authorization for Prime Healthcare's internal health plan. Explicitly marked "FOR PRIME EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ENROLLED DEPENDENTS USE ONLY." Not applicable to general patients.

3. **Form-3** — an employment services authorization from Desert Valley Medical Group for occupational health services (DOT physicals, drug screens). Not an ROI form.

The DVH Medical Records page (dvmc.com/patients-visitors/medical-records/) instructs patients to submit requests via mail, fax, or in person, with a $15 fee and 14-business-day turnaround. No online portal, no downloadable form, and no email submission option are offered.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DVH does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The Prime Healthcare template (form-2) is a generic "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" designed for all release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both the authorizing entity and themselves as recipient — workable but not optimized for self-request. The form does include a "patient request" checkbox under Purpose, which at least acknowledges this use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was rated **Hard**. The dvmc.com website was thoroughly searched — including sitemap crawling and URL pattern probing — with no authorization form found. The Desert Valley Medical Group site yielded only the employment services form. Success required identifying the Prime Healthcare parent system and checking sister hospitals' websites. A typical patient would have no way to discover or download the form online.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2) has notable technical strengths: 47 fillable interactive fields allow on-screen completion, and the document has a full text layer. The 2-page layout follows a logical sequence — demographics, release details, record-type selection, purpose, expiration, patient rights, format options, and signature. The "MY RIGHTS" section uses clear first-person language explaining refusal rights, inspection rights, and revocation procedures. HITECH electronic format options (CD, paper, email) are explicitly cited.

However, weaknesses are present: the form requests a full Social Security Number (unnecessary and a privacy risk), the opening warns that incomplete forms "may invalidate this Authorization" (potentially coercive), a "Witness" line appears without guidance on whether it's required, the header contains a typo ("OR" instead of "OF"), and field names are not accessible (empty in metadata, potentially impacting screen readers). The 1.65 MB file size for a 2-page form reflects poor optimization.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is explicitly required. Fax submission is available (an adequate electronic pathway). The $15 fee is disclosed only on the website, not on the form itself. The SSN collection and completeness-invalidation warning are the most concerning compliance issues — SSN is not required by HIPAA for records requests, and the warning could pressure patients into providing unnecessary information. The witness line creates ambiguity that may deter patients. The "financially responsible party" listed as an authorized signer raises questions about conflating billing and health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 47 interactive fields — significantly better than many flat/print-only forms
- HITECH electronic format citation with email delivery option
- Granular sensitive-information consent (seven categories requiring individual initials)
- Clear patient rights section with California-specific re-disclosure language

## Overall Assessment

Desert Valley Hospital earns a **C grade**. While the underlying Prime Healthcare form template is reasonably well-designed with fillable fields and a clear rights section, the hospital's failure to publish any patient-facing form online creates a fundamental access barrier. A patient must either contact HIM by phone to obtain the form, visit in person, or discover it on a sister hospital's website — none of which constitute an accessible online pathway. The generic authorization design, SSN collection, and coercive completeness language further reduce patient-centeredness.

# Owensboro Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Owensboro Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Owensboro, Kentucky, operating three hospitals (Regional Hospital, Muhlenberg Community Hospital, and Twin Lakes Medical Center) plus a medical group. The organization provides a single, system-wide "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Health Information" form (form-1) accompanied by a dedicated plain-language instruction sheet (form-2). Both documents are easily accessible online.

## Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved, both directly downloadable PDFs:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary ROI authorization form (2 pages). This is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Patients check "Me" as recipient and "Patient Request" as purpose to request their own records.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A companion instruction document (2 pages) explaining each section of the form in plain language, with submission addresses, fax numbers, and an email address.

Submission options include mail, fax, and email (himroi@owensborohealth.org for the main hospital), providing adequate electronic submission pathways. MyChart is also referenced as both a format and delivery option, indicating a patient portal pathway exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Owensboro Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves all purposes — patient requests, legal/attorney, insurance, and third-party release. However, the form does clearly accommodate patient self-access: "Me" is a prominently positioned recipient checkbox, "Patient Request" is a reason option, and the instruction document is written from the patient's perspective ("If you are wanting to receive your records check the box labeled 'Me'"). The dual-purpose design means patients must navigate fields intended for third-party release (recipient address, legal representative sections) and understand which parts apply to them, but the instruction sheet mitigates this confusion substantially.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. A simple web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's medical records page also surfaces both documents. No login walls, bot blocking, or CAPTCHAs were encountered. This earns a top findability score.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form has a proper text layer but **zero fillable fields** — all data entry areas are underscored blank lines and non-interactive checkboxes. This is a print-and-fill document. A patient must print, handwrite, and then fax, mail, or email a scan. The layout is logically organized across 2 pages with clear section headers and a reasonable field count (~15-18 fields). Language is a mix of plain English and necessary legal terminology; the companion instruction document compensates by restating everything in plain language.

The form offers an unusually comprehensive set of format options (Paper, MyChart, EHI Export, Email, Fax, CD, USB) and delivery methods (Mail, Pickup, Fax, MyChart, encrypted email, unencrypted email with risk warning). The explicit inclusion of **EHI Export** with a detailed explanation — covering all ePHI across the organization and named Community Connect Partners, delivered in TSV format — is rare and exemplary.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Multiple submission channels (mail, fax, email) are available. No fees are mentioned on the form or instructions, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs but not actively deterred. The 120-day authorization expiration is appropriate for third-party releases but is technically unnecessary for patient self-access under HIPAA § 164.524, which grants an ongoing right. The "Your Rights" section covers voluntariness, right to revoke, right to inspect, and re-disclosure risk — a solid rights statement.

## Notable Strengths

- **EHI Export option**: Explicitly offered with named partner organizations and format details — well ahead of industry norms.
- **Companion instruction document**: A dedicated 2-page plain-language guide is an uncommon and patient-friendly practice.
- **Comprehensive delivery options**: Seven format choices and six delivery methods, including encrypted/unencrypted email with clear risk disclosure.
- **Help phone number**: The instruction document closes with a direct number for assistance.

## Weaknesses

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields despite having a digital text layer — a missed opportunity for a fully digital workflow.
- **No pathway differentiation**: Patient self-access is routed through the same authorization form as third-party releases.
- **No fee transparency**: Neither document mentions whether fees apply to patient access requests.
- **120-day expiration**: Applied broadly, including to patient self-access requests where it is legally unnecessary.

## Overall Assessment

Owensboro Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its comprehensive format/delivery options, EHI Export transparency, and companion instruction document. The main limitations are the non-fillable PDF format and the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization. For a community hospital system, this is a well-above-average effort that could reach excellence with fillable form fields and a patient-specific access process.
