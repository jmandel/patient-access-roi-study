# Batch 4 — Best Practices Showcase

## Standout Organizations

### Flowers Hospital (Dothan, AL) — The Gold Standard in This Batch
**Grade: A | For-profit community hospital, Community Health Systems**

Flowers Hospital earned the highest score in this batch (4.65) by combining nearly every best practice into a single coherent experience. The form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" — not "Authorization to Disclose" — with "Myself" as the first recipient option, signaling that patient self-access is the primary use case. The 66-field fillable PDF allows full digital completion, and a co-equal Spanish translation (HIM-1406S) mirrors the English form field-for-field. A Swellbox online portal provides an alternative fully digital pathway. Delivery options include removable media with patient-chosen password protection. This is a for-profit CHS facility in rural Alabama doing what many academic medical centers do not: treating patient access as a first-class workflow.

### Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin — Patient-Centered by Design
**Grade: B (4.4) | Independent nonprofit physician practice, Midwest**

GHC-SCW maintains separate forms for patient self-access and third-party release — a structural best practice few organizations implement. The dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information Form" is a single-page fillable PDF with 49 interactive fields and question-based section headers like plain-English prompts. Delivery defaults to encrypted email (privacy by design), with MyChart, CD, USB, and paper also available. The form commits to a **5-business-day turnaround** — far exceeding HIPAA's 30-day requirement. For a small cooperative practice, this level of intentional design is remarkable.

### Huntington Hospital / Northwell Health — Two-Form Architecture
**Grade: B | Major nonprofit community hospital, Northeast**

Northwell Health distinguishes itself with a rare two-form system: a general third-party authorization and a dedicated "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative" that opens with an explicit citation of HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524. The patient form presents "To me" as the first recipient option and includes 28 fillable fields. Companion instruction documents with annotated examples ("Jane Patient," "Dr. Jane Jones at 300 Northwell Drive") are a genuine accessibility aid. Delivery options span seven methods including USB flash drive and secure/unsecure email with informed consent. The main gap — no submission instructions on any form — is a significant miss on an otherwise strong package.

### Labette Health (Parsons, KS) — Digital-First Community Hospital
**Grade: B | Independent nonprofit community hospital, Midwest**

This small Kansas community hospital leapfrogged peers with a Formstack online form featuring electronic signature, photo ID upload for identity verification, and email delivery of records. The form explicitly lists "Patient/Self" as the first relationship option. For a facility of this size, the fully digital no-paper workflow — with 15+ specific record-type checkboxes and sensitive-information exclusion options — is genuinely innovative. The approach shows that digital-first design is not limited to large systems with big IT budgets.

### Owensboro Health (Owensboro, KY) — EHI Export and Plain-Language Instructions
**Grade: ~B | Independent nonprofit regional system, South**

Owensboro Health stands out for two features rarely seen together. First, it explicitly offers **EHI Export** as a delivery format — naming Community Connect partner organizations and specifying TSV format — putting it well ahead of industry norms on interoperability. Second, a dedicated two-page plain-language instruction document walks patients through every section of the form, closing with a direct help phone number. The instruction sheet advises: "If you are wanting to receive your records check the box labeled 'Me.'" Seven format choices and six delivery methods (including encrypted/unencrypted email with clear risk disclosure) round out a comprehensive offering.

### Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — Portal-First Messaging
**Grade: B (4.0) | Major nonprofit community hospital, Midwest**

Advocate Health's dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" form places a prominent LiveWell patient portal callout at the top, directing patients to self-service digital access before the paper process even begins. The form lists "Myself" as the first recipient and offers five delivery methods including encrypted email and portal. At 22+ record-type checkboxes on a single concise page, it balances comprehensiveness with usability. The November 2025 revision date and companion Spanish-language authorization show active maintenance.

## Patterns Across This Batch

The clearest signal in this batch is that **dedicated patient access forms correlate with better outcomes** — organizations that separate patient self-access from third-party authorization (Flowers, GHC-SCW, Northwell, Advocate, Providence, UAB) consistently score higher on patient-centeredness. Most organizations (roughly 75% of this batch) still funnel patients through generic third-party authorization forms, forcing patients to write their own name in the "recipient" field of a form designed for attorneys and insurers.

**Facility type does not predict quality.** The top performer is a for-profit community hospital; the worst experiences came from organizations of all types. Small critical access hospitals (Labette, Myrtue) sometimes outperform major teaching hospitals on digital accessibility. **Bilingual availability** appeared across all facility sizes — from Prevea Health's four-language offering (English, Hmong, Somali, Spanish) reflecting Wisconsin demographics, to small FQHCs in Texas and Georgia.

**Fillable PDFs remain uncommon but transformative.** Only about a quarter of organizations in this batch offer any fillable fields, yet those that do (Flowers at 66 fields, Yale New Haven at 97, Providence at 72, GHC-SCW at 49) deliver dramatically better digital experiences. The gap between a born-digital PDF with zero fillable fields and one with interactive fields represents the single highest-impact improvement most organizations could make.
