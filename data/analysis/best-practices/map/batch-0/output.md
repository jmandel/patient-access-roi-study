# Best Practices Showcase — Batch 0

## Standout Organizations

### Barnes-Jewish Hospital — The Gold Standard for Pathway Differentiation

Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJC HealthCare, 1,278-bed teaching hospital, St. Louis) is the clearest example in this batch of an organization that designed its records process *around* the patient. It maintains a **dedicated "Request for Access to Protected Health Information by Individual Patients"** form, completely separate from its third-party authorization form. The website's Medical Records Requests page explicitly categorizes "Individual requests" separately from "Third-party requests," so patients see an unambiguous path. The patient form uses right-of-access language ("requesting access") rather than authorization language — the correct legal framing under HIPAA § 164.524. At just one page with ~12 fields, it minimizes patient burden. The "Abstract" checkbox bundles all starred record types into a single selection — a clever shortcut for patients who want comprehensive records without checking thirteen boxes. Electronic delivery via email is explicitly offered. Fee language aligns with HIPAA's cost-based standard, and a 30-day response time is clearly stated. The only real weakness: zero fillable fields on an otherwise exemplary form.

### Northwell Health (Huntington & Phelps Hospitals) — Dedicated Access Form with HIPAA Citation and Instructions

Northwell Health's system-wide "Request for Access to Health Information" form (VD087) explicitly cites **HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524** — making the patient's legal right visible on the document itself. The form offers "To me" as the first recipient option, includes 28 fillable interactive fields for digital completion, and is accompanied by a **companion instruction document with annotated visual examples** showing patients how to complete each section. Seven delivery format options — including USB flash drive, CD, secure email, unsecure email (with informed consent), fax, mail, and pickup — give patients genuine choice. This level of documentation and format flexibility is rare and reflects institutional investment in the patient experience.

### Advocate Health (Good Samaritan & Aurora Medical Center - Grafton) — Portal-First with Dedicated Forms

Advocate Health's patient access form opens with a prominent callout: *"Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org."* The form's first recipient option is "☐ Myself," and it requires no purpose-of-release statement for patient requests — correctly recognizing that HIPAA does not require patients to justify accessing their own records. The system maintains separate patient access and third-party authorization forms across facilities, with Spanish versions available. Five delivery methods include encrypted email — an uncommon and welcome option. This portal-first, patient-second, paper-third hierarchy is a model for how organizations should layer their access pathways.

### Merit Health Central — Patient-Titled Fillable Bilingual Form

This CHS-affiliated for-profit hospital in Jackson, MS stands out with a form titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** — not "Authorization for Release." With 66 fillable interactive fields, "Myself" as the first recipient option, and a full Spanish translation with identical field count, it demonstrates that patient-centered design is achievable within a large for-profit system. The footer acknowledges: *"This Healthcare Facility recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information."* Five delivery methods include removable media with password protection — an unusually thoughtful security option. A Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital alternative.

### Olmsted Medical Center — Technical Excellence in Form Design

This independent nonprofit practice in Rochester, MN delivers a **single-page fillable PDF with 62 interactive fields** — genuinely digital-first. It is available in **English, Spanish, and Somali** — the Somali translation being notably responsive to Rochester's refugee community. The form explicitly references CFR 164.524 and includes a non-conditioning statement. Patient portal delivery is offered alongside traditional methods. For a 61-bed independent practice, this level of multilingual, digitally accessible form design is exceptional.

### Broward Health — Four-Language Accessibility

This government-owned system in South Florida offers its ROI form in **English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese** — reflecting genuine attention to the community's linguistic diversity. Combined with a Swellbox online portal and explicit CFR 164.524 citation, this represents meaningful investment in equitable access, even though the English form itself is unfortunately an image-only scan.

## Patterns Across This Batch

**Dedicated patient access forms are the single strongest differentiator.** The seven organizations that maintain separate patient self-access forms (Barnes-Jewish, Northwell/Huntington, Northwell/Phelps, Advocate Good Samaritan, Aurora-Grafton, Erlanger, Merit Health Central, Philadelphia FIGHT, UTMB, West Tennessee Healthcare, St. Joseph's Phoenix, Baton Rouge Clinic) consistently score higher on patient-centeredness. Yet the vast majority — roughly 35 of 47 organizations in this batch — still funnel patients through generic third-party authorization forms.

**Fillable fields remain uncommon but transformative.** Organizations with 50+ fillable fields (Yale New Haven at 97, Northwestern at 79, Duke at 67, Merit Health at 66, Saratoga at 65, Ben Taub at 65, Olmsted at 62, UW Medical Center at 61, Sturdy Memorial at 59) demonstrate that interactive PDFs are technically achievable. Yet most organizations in this batch publish flat, print-and-handwrite PDFs — even when digitally authored.

**System affiliation enables but doesn't guarantee quality.** Advocate Health and Northwell Health show how system-level investment creates consistent patient-centered forms across facilities. But other large systems (HCA/Riverside, Tenet/Good Samaritan WPB) deploy generic, non-fillable authorization forms system-wide, propagating mediocrity at scale.

**Multilingual availability correlates with community awareness, not org size.** Olmsted Medical Center (61 beds, three languages), Broward Health (four languages), and Prevea Health (four languages including Hmong and Somali) show that smaller organizations serving diverse communities can lead on language access, while many large teaching hospitals offer English only.
