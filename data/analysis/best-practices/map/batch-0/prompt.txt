# Southwell (Tift Regional Health System) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Southwell's medical release page at `mysouthwell.com/medical-release/` presents four downloadable documents. Two are parallel ROI authorization forms — one for the hospital system (form-1, "TRHS Authorization to Release/Obtain PHI," 2 pages) and one for the ambulatory clinics (form-3, "SWA Authorization to Release Protected Health Information," 1 page). Form-2 is a newer image-only scan (July 2025, produced on a Canon copier) that appears to be a revised version of form-1 but with degraded quality and no text layer. Form-4 is a reference list of ~40 TRHS entity names and addresses, not an ROI form. The organization also references Verisma as an online records request partner at a separate page (`mysouthwell.com/medical-record-request/`), but this pathway was not directly evaluated as part of the form download process.

The most relevant form for patient self-access at the hospital system is **form-1**, the TRHS authorization. It has a text layer, logical numbered structure, and covers the main hospital facilities. Form-3 serves the same role for ambulatory clinics.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Southwell does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All downloadable forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. They require the patient to name a recipient ("This information may be disclosed to and used by the following individual or organization") even when the patient is requesting records for personal use. "Personal Use" appears as one of six purpose checkboxes, but the form's architecture assumes a third-party release workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no simplified self-access flow. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, figuring out that they should write their own name in the "recipient" field.

The split between TRHS hospital forms and SWA ambulatory forms further fragments the experience. A patient who received care at both a hospital and a specialty clinic would need to complete two separate authorization forms for two different legal entities, with no clear guidance about which form covers which facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was relatively straightforward. The medical release page is accessible via the website's navigation (Home → Patient & Visitors → Medical Release), and web searches surfaced the page without difficulty. No bot blocking or login requirements were encountered. However, the page presents multiple forms without clear differentiation — patients must determine whether form-1, form-2, or form-3 applies to their situation, and the relationship between the overlapping TRHS forms (form-1 vs. form-2) is unclear.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 (the best available) has a text layer and logical numbered structure (8 sections covering facility selection, record types, sensitive info notice, recipient, purpose, revocation, non-conditioning, and voluntary disclosure). It offers good granularity in record type selection — 10 categories with individual date range fields, plus delivery options (Paper, CD, Electronic Delivery). However, the form has **zero fillable fields**. All checkboxes and text fields are static, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. The form does not specify how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, email address, or mailing instructions for submission appear on the form itself (the mailing address in Section 6 relates to revocation, not submission).

The language is moderately legalistic, with dense compliance-driven text in the sensitive information notice and revocation sections. The layout is functional but the second page contains only two short paragraphs and signature lines, suggesting it could be consolidated. Form-2 represents a regression — an image-only scan with no text layer, no OCR, degraded readability, and Paper pre-checked as the delivery method.

## Barriers

Two notable barriers exist. First, a **witness signature** is required on all forms — HIPAA does not require witnesses for authorization or access requests, and this creates a real obstacle for patients completing forms independently at home. Second, all forms collect the **last 4 digits of SSN**, an unnecessary data element that creates privacy risk beyond what MRN and DOB provide.

No fees are mentioned on any form. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated. The 90-day default expiration on forms 1 and 3 (extended to one year on form-2) could force resubmission if processing is slow.

## Overall Assessment

Southwell provides a minimally functional but decidedly paper-oriented records request process. The forms are findable and structurally organized, with useful features like granular record type selection and an electronic delivery option. However, the lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, the fragmented multi-form landscape, and the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway all reflect a process designed for institutional convenience rather than patient self-service. The organization appears to offer a Verisma online portal as an alternative, which could meaningfully improve the digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms remain firmly rooted in a print-and-mail paradigm.

# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, a nonprofit community hospital in Downers Grove, IL, operates under the Advocate Health system and uses system-wide forms for medical records requests. The organization distinguishes itself by maintaining a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-4, "Patient Request for Health Information") that is clearly separated from its third-party authorization form (form-5, "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information"). This separation is a best practice that most healthcare organizations do not follow.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Seven documents were retrieved, but only four are relevant to patient medical records access:

- **Form-4** (primary): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a single-page form designed specifically for patients requesting their own records, with a "Myself" checkbox, portal callout, and five delivery method options.
- **Form-5**: "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — the third-party disclosure authorization, a companion to form-4.
- **Form-6**: Spanish-language authorization form (corresponds to the third-party release, not the patient self-request form).
- **Form-7**: Step-by-step instructions for completing the authorization form, with a portal-first framing.

The remaining forms (form-1, form-2, form-3) are Employee Assistance Program releases or a legacy Advocate Medical Group form — none relevant to hospital patient access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocate Health earns high marks for pathway differentiation. Form-4 is explicitly titled "Patient Request for Health Information" and opens with a prominent callout: *"Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org."* The form's first recipient option is "☐ Myself." This is a clear, dedicated patient access pathway — patients are not forced through a generic third-party authorization workflow.

The organization also offers the LiveWell patient portal as an alternative digital pathway, referenced on both form-4 and the instructions document (form-7). This portal-first suggestion is a notable patient-centered design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Advocate Health medical records page (advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records) clearly lists both primary forms with direct PDF download links, plus the Spanish version and instructions. No bot blocking was encountered, and all PDFs downloaded successfully. The main challenge was that the system-level organization of forms means patients searching specifically for "Good Samaritan Hospital" forms may not immediately find the centralized system page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the patient self-access form, is a well-designed single-page document that fits patient demographics, 22+ record-type checkboxes (across medical records, imaging, and billing categories), delivery method options, sensitive information acknowledgment, and signature blocks into one page. The layout is logical with clear three-column organization for record types. Language is plain and accessible.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a born-digital PDF with 8 embedded fonts and clean vector graphics. Patients must print and hand-fill, a significant missed opportunity. The form also **lacks submission instructions** — there is no mailing address, fax number, or email address telling patients where to send the completed form.

Five delivery methods are offered: paper copy by mail, CD, encrypted email, patient portal, and in-person pick-up. The inclusion of encrypted email is uncommon and welcome.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form is relatively barrier-free: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person-only submission mandate. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("Fees may apply") without amounts or a fee schedule reference. No response time is stated. Form-4 does not include an explicit patient rights statement, though form-5's companion rights section covers revocation, non-conditioning, and re-disclosure.

A notable gap exists for Spanish-speaking patients: the Spanish-language form (form-6) corresponds to the third-party authorization, not the patient self-request form. Spanish-speaking patients must use a more complex disclosure authorization to request their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, via its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its dedicated patient access form and portal-first messaging. The differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release is a model for other organizations. The form's content design is solid — concise, well-organized, and comprehensive in scope options. The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a paper workflow for the form itself), missing submission instructions, and vague fee language. The patient portal provides a digital alternative that partially compensates for the PDF's limitations. Overall, this organization provides an above-average patient experience for records access, earning a **B** grade.

# Olmsted Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Olmsted Medical Center (OMC) is an independent nonprofit physician practice in Rochester, MN. Two forms were found on the organization's website: a primary "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (form-1) and a companion "Authorization for Allowing Verbal Communication of Protected Health Information" (form-2). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records; form-2 is limited to authorizing verbal discussions with a designated person and explicitly disclaims any written record release.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

OMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. The primary form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, employers, and others. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this generic form: they fill in OMC's address in the "Release Information From" field (pre-populated) and put their own name and address in the "Release Information To" field. The form includes a "Personal" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which at least provides a recognizable option, but there is no guidance text explaining how a patient should complete the form for self-access specifically. The form does not differentiate between individual access rights under § 164.524 and third-party authorization under § 164.508.

That said, the form does reference "CRF 164.524" (a typo for CFR) and includes a strong non-conditioning statement — both patient-protective elements that go beyond what many generic authorization forms include.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. OMC hosts a dedicated "Manage Your Health Information" page accessible through clear website navigation (Patients & Visitors > Your Care & Visit > Manage Your Health Information). Multiple search strategies — filetype:pdf queries, site-scoped searches, and direct navigation — all led to the form quickly. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot blocking, which prevented programmatic downloads via curl but would not affect a patient using a browser. The page also lists Spanish and Somali translations, MyChart proxy access forms, and the verbal communication authorization form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **62 interactive form fields** — a truly digital-first design, not a scan or print-only document. The layout uses a clean left-column label / right-column field structure with clearly delineated sections: patient demographics, release from/to, method of disclosure, date range, record type selection (a granular checkbox grid), reason for release, authorization/expiration, revocation rights, and signature. The language is mostly plain and functional, though the opening line — "This is a legal document" — may intimidate some patients. The authorization section includes standard but dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation.

Delivery options include mail, pick up, fax (marked "Urgent Only — limitations may apply"), and patient portal (also with "limitations may apply"). The inclusion of patient portal delivery is a positive signal, though the unexplained "limitations" qualifiers create uncertainty. Submission methods include any OMC location, postal mail, or fax (507.287.2777), with a phone number for questions. Fax availability means a patient can submit without visiting in person or relying on postal mail.

## Barriers and Compliance

OMC imposes no unusual barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no upfront fee disclosure. The one-year default authorization expiration is standard. Revocation rights are clearly stated and require written notice to the Health Information Department. The form explicitly references the patient's right to inspect or receive copies under CFR 164.524 and states that OMC will not condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility on signing the authorization — a strong compliance posture.

Minor issues include two typos ("CRF" for "CFR" and "provide" for "provided"), an inconsistent mailing address between form-1 and form-2, and the unexplained "limitations may apply" qualifiers on fax and portal delivery. The "File Only — No Records Needed at this time" option in the delivery section is an internal administrative option that may confuse patients.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in English, Spanish, and Somali — the Somali translation is notably community-responsive for Rochester, MN
- **62 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive digital form, uncommon in healthcare ROI
- **Patient portal delivery option** alongside traditional methods
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference** and non-conditioning statement — unusually transparent about patient rights
- **Clean single-page design** that fits comprehensive content without feeling cramped

## Overall Assessment

Olmsted Medical Center delivers a technically strong, well-organized, and accessible ROI form that is easy to find and free of significant barriers. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must use a generic third-party authorization form and figure out how to adapt it for their own purposes. Despite this, the form's quality, fillability, multilingual support, and compliance posture make it a solid option for patients. The organization earns a **B** grade: strong document quality and accessibility, held back by the generic-form-for-all-purposes approach to patient access.

# St. Charles Redmond — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

St. Charles Redmond is part of the St. Charles Health System, a nonprofit regional system operating four hospitals across Central Oregon (Bend, Redmond, Madras, Prineville). The system uses a single, unified ROI authorization form across all locations — there is no Redmond-specific form. Four PDF documents were retrieved: a legacy 2016 non-fillable version (form-1), a superseded 2022 fillable version (form-2), the current 2025 English fillable version (form-3), and the current 2025 Spanish fillable version (form-4). The primary form for assessment is **form-3.pdf**, the current English authorization form linked from the website.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

St. Charles does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All records requests — whether a patient seeking their own records or a third party requesting disclosure — are routed through the same "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. A patient requesting their own records checks "Personal" under the purpose field, but the form's From/To structure, designed to handle bidirectional provider-to-provider transfers, is unintuitive for simple self-access. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and the form uses an authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than an access-request framework — a meaningful distinction that affects fee limits and processing timelines.

The website's release-of-information page does distinguish between self-requests and third-party requests in its instructions, and notes that patients can alternatively use **MyChart** for records from April 7, 2018 onward. This patient portal pathway offers a fully digital alternative, though it is limited to records after the system's EHR transition date.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the St. Charles ROI page, which is clearly linked under the Patients section. Both English and Spanish PDF links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor issue was that legacy form URLs remain accessible on the server, meaning a search engine could direct patients to an outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a well-constructed 2-page fillable PDF with **65 interactive fields** covering all data-entry points. This is a genuinely usable digital document — patients can type their responses on-screen. The form uses a numbered section system (1–10) with matching instructions at the bottom of each page, a thoughtful design pattern. Record-type options are granular, with parenthetical descriptions explaining what each category includes. Plain-language parentheticals gloss legal concepts (e.g., "revoke (take back or change my mind about)").

However, the layout is dense, and the dual From/To sections (3 and 4) have **identical instruction text**, creating confusion about which section applies to whom. The CORA radiology contact information adds operational clutter. The form collects approximately 15–20 patient-facing fields (demographics, purpose, locations, record types, date range, sensitive-records initials, format/delivery, and signature).

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the **wet-ink signature requirement** — the form explicitly states "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED," preventing electronic signatures and forcing patients to print the form after filling it digitally. The submission pathway then requires faxing (HIM fax number is listed in the footer: 541-706-6352) or mailing to the Bend HIM office. Fax submission is available, satisfying the electronic submission threshold, but the print-sign-fax workflow is cumbersome.

Fees are mentioned twice ("Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations") but never quantified, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. No fee schedule is referenced. The form does not distinguish between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's cost-based limits) and third-party release fees.

No notarization is required. A photo ID check appears in the office-use section but is not presented as a patient-facing barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Full Spanish translation (form-4) with 65 fillable fields — genuinely uncommon and meaningful for Central Oregon's community.
- **Iterative improvement**: The progression from flat PDF (2016) to 64-field fillable (2022) to 65-field fillable (2025) shows active form maintenance.
- **System-wide form with location checkboxes**: Simplifies multi-location requests within the St. Charles system.
- **MyChart alternative**: Provides a fully digital pathway for post-2018 records.

## Overall Assessment

St. Charles Redmond provides a competent but undifferentiated records-request process. The form itself is technically well-made — fillable, bilingual, well-organized — but it funnels patients through a generic authorization framework that wasn't designed for individual access. The wet-ink signature requirement undermines the otherwise digital-friendly form design, and the lack of fee transparency or Right of Access language represents missed opportunities. The MyChart alternative partially compensates but doesn't cover the full record history. Overall, this is a **C-grade** experience: functional and findable, but not patient-centered.

# Esse Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Esse Health is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in St. Louis, Missouri. Two documents were retrieved from their patient forms page: an Authorization for Release of Medical Information (form-1.pdf) and a communication/message authorization (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own health records. Notably, Esse Health also offers a DocuSign-based electronic submission pathway for the same ROI form, which meaningfully improves the overall patient experience.

## Access Pathway

Esse Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single ROI form (form-1.pdf) is a generic HIPAA authorization with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED BY" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields — a structure designed for records transfers between providers or releases to attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no separate section for individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient requesting their own records has different rights than a third party requesting records on someone's behalf.

The form does cite 45 CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA right of access provision), which is a positive signal, but this is buried in a dense paragraph of legal language rather than presented as guidance for patients. The availability of a DocuSign electronic submission option is a genuine bright spot — it allows patients to complete and submit the form digitally without printing, scanning, or visiting the office.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF URL, and the patient forms page at `essehealth.com/patient-center/patient-forms/` is well-organized with clear labeling under "General Forms." No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The retrieval was rated **easy**. One minor issue: the communication authorization form (form-2) has "Medical Records" in its website title, which could mislead a patient looking for the actual records release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF. While the metadata reports 28 fillable field annotations, the field names array is empty, suggesting the fields may not be properly configured for interactive use. The form relies on underline blanks — it was designed primarily as a print-and-write document. However, the DocuSign alternative compensates significantly by providing a fully interactive digital pathway.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, release from/to fields, 11 record-type checkboxes, sensitive information disclosure, revocation and expiration language, and signature. The language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese — the opening authorization statement is clear, but the disclosure paragraphs covering HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse are denser. At one page, the form is appropriately concise without being cramped.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment. It provides a six-month default expiration and a revocation mechanism, though the revocation language ("present my written cancellation to the health information management department") is ambiguous about whether this can be done remotely. Fee disclosure is vague — "there may be a charge associated with copying my health information" — with no specifics about amounts or HIPAA's cost-based limits. No delivery format options (electronic, paper, mail, pick-up) are mentioned, which is a gap for patient self-access scenarios. Submission options include the DocuSign electronic pathway, making electronic submission available.

## Overall Assessment

Esse Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The key strength is the DocuSign electronic submission option, which elevates the experience above many peers by enabling end-to-end digital completion and submission. The key weakness is the lack of any differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — the generic authorization form forces patients to navigate a process not designed for them. The form itself is clean and concise but not interactive, and the fee disclosure is vague. For an independent physician practice, this represents a middle-of-the-road effort: the form is easy to find and usable, but the organization has not invested in a patient-centered access pathway.

# Good Samaritan Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Good Samaritan Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in West Palm Beach, FL, operated under the Palm Beach Health Network (PBHN), itself part of Tenet Healthcare. The facility offers two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records release — an older facility-specific version (form-1, dated 2014) and a newer network-wide version (form-2, dated 2020). Records requests are processed through Datavant, a third-party ROI vendor, with email submission available. The parent system's medical records page also offers the form in Spanish and Haitian Creole.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

Good Samaritan does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — standard third-party disclosure authorization forms. A patient requesting their own records must name themselves as the "RECIPIENT" (the field asks for "person(s) to whom [the facility] may disclose my health information") and check "Personal Use" under the PURPOSE section. This is functional but unintuitive; the form was clearly designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties, not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. Neither form references the right of access, offers format options for records delivery, or distinguishes self-access from third-party release in any meaningful way.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately surfaced a direct link to form-1 on the hospital's website, and the parent PBHN medical records page linked to form-2 along with Spanish and Haitian Creole versions. However, Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic download, requiring browser-based workarounds. For a typical patient using a browser, this would not be an issue. One source of confusion: both the older facility form and the newer network form are published simultaneously with no guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2, the 2020 network version) is a 2-page print-and-fill PDF with **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring handwriting. The form follows a logical structure — facility selection, demographics, record type checkboxes (20 categories), recipient, term, purpose, super-confidential categories — but is visually dense with small fonts. Notably, form-2 exposes raw mail-merge placeholders in the sidebar (`«PatientNumber»`, `«PatientName»`, `«BirthDate»`, etc.) that are meaningless to patients and appear unprofessional. The form also references a Privacy Office address "listed below" that does not actually appear anywhere on the document — a broken internal reference that prevents patients from exercising their right to revoke authorization.

The language is moderately legalistic. The legal paragraphs on redisclosure, revocation, and treatment conditioning are standard healthcare boilerplate but lack plain-language explanation. The form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for HIPAA identity verification and creates data security risk on a form transmitted via fax or mail.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit via fax (561-650-6467, listed on form-1), email to Datavant (SM-Tenetgoodsamaritan@Datavant.com, per retrieval notes), mail, or in-person pickup. The availability of fax and email means patients are not forced to physically visit the facility, which meets the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers:** SSN collection is unnecessary and potentially deterrent. No fees are disclosed — patients have no visibility into costs before submitting. The form's lack of fillable fields means the entire completion process is paper-based. Form-2 is missing Privacy Office contact information, and its omission of the remuneration disclosure present in form-1 raises compliance questions given Datavant's involvement.

**Bright spots:** Multilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is a genuine strength for the Palm Beach community. The 20+ record-type checkboxes give patients granular control over what is disclosed. Flexible authorization term options (specific date, until fulfilled, until event, until withdrawn) are well-designed. The super-confidential information section on page 2 properly handles Florida state law and 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for sensitive health information categories.

## Overall Assessment

Good Samaritan Medical Center provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all requestors — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access. The forms lack digital fillability, contain confusing internal system artifacts, and collect unnecessary personal information. While multilingual availability and granular record selection are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects a process designed around institutional workflow rather than patient needs. Grade: **C**.

# Penobscot Community Health Care — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Bangor, Maine. Two PDF forms were found, but they are identical documents hosted at different WordPress upload paths (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf share the same text, revision date, and form code MRC001). The organization's primary records request pathway is a third-party Datavant/Swellbox online portal, linked from the Health Information Management page. The PDF authorization form exists on the server but is not linked from any patient-facing page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

PCHC does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. The sole PDF form is titled "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" and covers both disclosing records TO a third party and obtaining records FROM a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the same form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties — including naming themselves as the recipient and navigating redisclosure warnings that don't apply to self-access. The purpose checkbox "At my request" is available but does not clearly distinguish individual access rights from authorized third-party release.

The Datavant/Swellbox portal (https://www.swellbox.com/pchc-wizard.html) is the pathway the organization actively directs patients toward from its website. While this provides a digital alternative, the PDF form — the only org-created document available for evaluation — remains a generic HIPAA authorization with no patient access specialization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted Google search (`filetype:pdf` query); it was **not discoverable** through normal website navigation. The HIM page (https://pchc.com/healthinformation/) links to the Datavant portal and a Privacy Practices Booklet, but not the authorization form PDF. Two identical copies at different URLs (`/2024/03/` and `/2021/11/` paths) create version-control confusion. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. Difficulty: moderate — the portal is findable from the website, but the PDF form is effectively hidden.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive fields) across 2 pages. Patients must print it, handwrite all entries, and submit physically. Despite the non-fillable format, the document itself is well-structured with clear, labeled sections progressing logically: patient identification → authorization direction → recipient details → delivery method → record types → sensitive information → purpose → duration → rights acknowledgments → signature. Approximately 18 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology. Core instructions ("To DISCLOSE my health information below TO:") are clear with helpful capitalization for emphasis, but several sections use dense legal prose. The "continuing communications" clause and opt-out-by-striking mechanisms are particularly confusing — patients must physically strike out text to limit scope, and failure to do so defaults to the broadest possible authorization, including ongoing disclosure of future encounters.

Record type granularity is good, offering seven specific categories plus an open-ended option, with date-range filtering. Four delivery methods are available: mail (defaulting to CD), fax, email via secure portal, and verbal communication.

## Barriers and Compliance

No fees are disclosed — neither excessive charges nor explicit statements of no-fee patient access. No notarization or witness is required. The form does not specify submission instructions, though PCHC's fax number (207-990-1248), mailing address, and email (PCHCMR@pchc.com) are provided in the header, implying fax and mail submission are available.

Compliance elements are generally sound: oral revocation is permitted, the non-conditioning statement is present, 42 CFR Part 2 redisclosure notice is properly included, and sensitive information categories require affirmative opt-in. However, the form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or reference the patient's right of access. The office-use section includes an unusual and commendable accountability checkbox requiring staff to flag partial or incomplete disclosures.

## Bright Spots

- **Secure email delivery** via PCHC's portal (records sent as PDFs accessible through a secure messaging system)
- **Oral revocation** permitted — more accessible than written-only requirements
- **Partial disclosure transparency** — internal checkbox requiring notification when records provided are incomplete
- **Datavant/Swellbox portal** provides an alternative digital pathway beyond the paper form

## Red Flags

- **PDF form is unlinkable from the website** — HIM page directs exclusively to Datavant, making the org's own form effectively hidden
- **Opt-out-by-striking defaults** to broadest possible authorization for continuing communications and third-party-received records
- **CD as default mail delivery** medium — outdated and likely unusable for many patients

## Overall Assessment

PCHC provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The organization deserves credit for offering a Datavant portal as a digital pathway and for several thoughtful compliance provisions. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access form, the non-fillable PDF, the hidden form URL, and the confusing opt-out defaults limit patient-centeredness. A patient navigating PCHC's website would be funneled to the Datavant portal — a workable option — but would struggle to find or use the organization's own authorization form independently.

# The Valley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

The Valley Hospital is a nonprofit, independent community hospital in Paramus, NJ, operating under the Valley Health System umbrella alongside Valley Medical Group (VMG) and Valley Home Care. Four PDF authorization forms were found — two VMG versions (July 2023 and May 2023), one older hospital-specific form hosted on MRO Corp's site (last revised 2011), and one Valley Home Care form (April 2023). Critically, the hospital's medical records page now directs patients to an online records request tool with identity verification via driver's license photo, rather than linking to any downloadable PDF forms.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is the **online records request tool** accessible from the medical records page at `valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`. This represents a meaningful shift toward patient-centered digital access — the identity verification via driver's license photo suggests a workflow specifically designed for the patient themselves, distinct from third-party release scenarios.

The PDF forms, by contrast, are all **generic HIPAA authorization forms** designed for release of information to any recipient. None is a dedicated patient access form. The most current form (form-1, VMG, July 2023) accommodates patient self-access through instructions that say "If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF'" — functional but clearly an afterthought within a third-party disclosure framework. The four forms create a confusing landscape: a patient of The Valley Hospital proper might not realize the VMG form is what they need for ambulatory records, while a separate home care form exists for Valley Home Care patients. No guidance on the website explains which form applies to which entity.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the online records request tool is straightforward — the medical records page sits at a logical URL in the patient resources section. Finding the PDF forms, however, requires search engine assistance. The medical records page no longer links to any downloadable PDFs. The forms remain hosted at their original URLs on valleyhealth.com (and on mrocorp.com for the older hospital form) but are effectively orphaned. A patient who specifically wants a PDF form would need to search externally — not an unreasonable ask, but not ideal either.

## Form Document Quality

The best PDF form (form-1, VMG July 2023) is a well-structured 2-page document with a clear Section A/Section B organization and a full second page of step-by-step instructions with practical examples. The instructions are genuinely helpful — explaining how to designate self-access, offering example expiration events, and warning about unencrypted email risks. However, **none of the four forms has any fillable/interactive PDF fields** (all have `fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being born-digital documents with clean text layers, they are designed purely for print-and-fill workflow. The form offers five delivery methods — fax, paper copy, CD, unencrypted email, and encrypted email — a strong set of options. The encrypted email option is a positive differentiator.

The language is mixed: the instructions page uses plain language, but the sensitive information consent section is dense. The form's handling of sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance use, reproductive health) includes important NJ-specific protections but is complex enough to confuse lay readers. Approximately 20–25 fields must be completed, which is reasonable for a records authorization.

## Barriers

**Misleading "entire record" checkbox**: Checking "Entire medical record" on form-1 will *exclude* Behavioral Health Specialist and Substance Use Specialist records unless those boxes are also separately checked. This is the most significant red flag — a patient checking "entire record" would reasonably expect completeness.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "there may be a fee" based on page count but discloses no amounts. The older hospital form (form-3) explicitly states a $1/page fee for personal use, which may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access. Fees are processed through MRO Disclosure Management Solutions, a third-party vendor.

**No form submission instructions**: Form-1 tells patients what to fill out but never specifies where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email for submission. Only the revocation address is provided.

**No notarization or witness required** on the primary form (form-1), though the older hospital form (form-3) includes a witness line.

## Bright Spots

- **Online portal transition**: The org has moved its primary pathway to a digital records request tool, significantly improving access over PDF-only workflows.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: Offering encrypted email alongside standard options demonstrates privacy awareness.
- **Comprehensive instructions**: The full-page plain-language instruction sheet with practical examples is among the better guidance we've seen.
- **Five delivery methods**: Fax, paper, CD, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients meaningful choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

The Valley Hospital earns a **B grade** primarily because of its transition to an online records request portal, which places it ahead of organizations still relying solely on paper forms. The PDF forms themselves are adequate but generic — they serve third-party release as the primary use case and accommodate patient self-access as a secondary scenario. The absence of fillable fields on all four PDFs is a missed opportunity for born-digital documents. The misleading "entire record" exclusion and fee ambiguity are notable compliance concerns, though neither rises to the level of an active barrier to access. The organization's investment in an online portal signals a patient-centered direction, even as its legacy PDF forms lag behind.

# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Three PDF forms were found for Carle BroMenn Medical Center, a community hospital in Normal, IL that is part of the Carle Health regional system:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary general ROI authorization form specific to the BroMenn/Normal campus (form code X3833-0820). One page. Covers Carle West Physician Group, Carle BroMenn Medical Center, and Carle Eureka Hospital.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A nearly identical system-level Carle Health ROI form for the Champaign campus (form code 174-0319). One page. Same structure but branded for the main Carle campus HIM department.
3. **form-3.pdf** — A behavioral health–specific authorization form for the BroMenn campus (form code X3852-0620). Two pages. Required separately for mental health records per Illinois law.

**Form-1 is the most relevant document** for a patient at Carle BroMenn Medical Center requesting their own general medical records. Form-2 serves the Champaign campus and would likely confuse a BroMenn patient. Form-3 is a companion form needed only for behavioral health records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Carle BroMenn does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" documents designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios. The form uses "To Send to" / "To Request from" framing, requiring patients to navigate a form designed for inter-provider transfers, legal disclosures, and insurance requests. There is no streamlined form or process specifically for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

That said, the form does include some patient-oriented elements: delivery via MyCarle Account (the patient portal), an explicit citation of CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access regulation), and a clear statement that signing is not required for treatment.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches surfaced direct PDF download links on carle.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or multi-step navigation was required. The carle.org medical records page links to the forms. All three were directly downloadable via curl. The only minor friction: a patient might encounter both form-1 (BroMenn-specific) and form-2 (Champaign-specific) without clear guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **digitally-authored but non-fillable PDF**. Despite being created digitally (not a scan), it has zero interactive form fields — every field must be filled by hand after printing. This is a significant missed opportunity. The form is well-organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of release → delivery method → record type selection → legal terms → signature. The granular record-type checkbox grid (30+ categories across hospitalization and clinic columns) gives patients meaningful control over scope. However, the single-page design makes the form cramped, with small font (estimated 8–9pt for legal text) and limited write-in space.

The language is a mix of clear and legalistic. Legal disclaimers are reasonably comprehensible but dense. The "ATTENTION: This is a legal document" warning is somewhat intimidating. There is no plain-language summary.

## Barriers

- **Purpose of disclosure required**: The form requires patients to state why they want their records — a requirement that is potentially non-compliant with HIPAA's Right of Access, which prohibits requiring a reason for patient self-access requests.
- **SSN field not marked optional**: Asks for last 4 digits of SSN without indicating it can be left blank.
- **Paper-only workflow**: No fillable fields, no fax number for submission, no email submission. A patient must print, handwrite, and mail the form or deliver it in person.
- **Behavioral health witness requirement**: Form-3 requires a witness signature for both the authorization and revocation — a barrier not required by HIPAA.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: States "there may be a charge" with no amounts. Form-3 mentions ScanStat as the third-party vendor processing requests.
- **No notarization required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — mail is an option.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyCarle Account electronic delivery** for records (30-day window) provides a digital delivery pathway even though the request itself is paper-based.
- **Explicit HIPAA citation** (CFR 164.524) — uncommon and commendable transparency about patient rights.
- **Granular record-type selection** gives patients fine-grained control over what is released.
- **Easy online findability** of forms with direct download links.
- **Appropriate behavioral health protections** including 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language and age-appropriate consent (12+ for mental health).

## Overall Assessment

Carle BroMenn Medical Center provides a functional but dated records request process. The forms are easy to find and reasonably well-organized, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of electronic submission options, and generic authorization design that doesn't differentiate patient self-access from third-party release hold it back. The purpose-of-disclosure requirement is a compliance concern for patient access requests. The organization earns credit for MyCarle Account delivery, explicit rights citations, and granular scope controls, but the fundamentally paper-based workflow and generic form design place it in the middle of the pack for patient-centeredness.

# Synthesis: Essentia Health-Fosston

## Overview

Essentia Health-Fosston is a critical access hospital in Fosston, MN, part of the regional nonprofit Essentia Health system. The facility does not maintain its own medical records forms; it uses system-wide Essentia Health documents for all records-related processes. Four documents were retrieved, but only one — the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (form-1, EH10843 12/25) — is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records. The other three documents serve adjacent purposes: MyChart portal enrollment (form-2), MyChart proxy access delegation (form-3), and verbal information-sharing authorization (form-4).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Essentia Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting records on behalf of someone else. Form-1 is a general-purpose authorization with "From" and "To" fields designed for transferring records between entities. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both fields — putting themselves as the recipient — and check "Personal use" as the reason. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and no tailored instructions for self-access requests. That said, Essentia Health does offer meaningful alternatives: the medical records page directs patients to **MyChart** as the primary access pathway and provides a **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** as a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link, and Essentia Health's medical records page (`essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`) is well-organized with clearly labeled download links. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was required. The URL structure is clean and descriptive. All forms are hosted on the main Essentia Health domain (except the MyChart-related forms on `essentiamychart.org`).

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page**, digitally-designed PDF with a complete text layer — impressively compact for the scope it covers. The layout follows a logical flow from patient demographics through release details, record type selection, delivery method, and legal notices. The form offers strong record type granularity with 18+ individual checkboxes plus an "All Routine Records" shortcut, and appropriately separates behavioral health and substance use disorder records with distinct opt-in/opt-out controls.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally composed. All data entry uses blank underscores, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a consistent pattern across all four Essentia Health forms and appears to be a deliberate system-wide design choice rather than a per-form oversight. The delivery method options are a bright spot: patients can receive records via MyChart, email, fax, or mail (paper or disc).

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unusual barriers — no notarization, no witness requirement (except for mark-based signatures), no in-person-only submission. Submission is available via email, fax, or mail. Fee language is vague: "I may be required to pay a fee for retrieval and photocopying of records," citing state statutes rather than HIPAA cost-based fee limits, with no specific amounts disclosed. The form properly includes anti-conditioning language, revocation rights, psychotherapy note protections, and 42 CFR Part 2 SUD protections. One notable issue: the MyChart enrollment forms (form-2, form-3) collect partial SSN, which is unnecessary for portal access and creates data minimization concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** provides a fully digital alternative pathway
- **Single-page form** — remarkably compact for comprehensive ROI coverage
- **Electronic delivery options** including email and MyChart — not just fax/mail
- **Multi-state legal compliance** across MN, WI, and ND
- **Recently revised** (December 2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Well-organized medical records page** with clear navigation and multiple pathway options

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization
- **Zero fillable fields** across all four system forms — entirely print-and-handwrite
- **Vague fee disclosure** with no specific amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee reference
- **Form-3 (MyChart proxy)** published as a proof copy with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers
- **Behavioral health opt-out vs. SUD opt-in** inconsistency may confuse patients

## Overall Assessment

Essentia Health-Fosston earns a **B grade**. The organization benefits from its parent system's well-organized web presence, a compact and recently-updated authorization form, and the availability of a digital request portal. The main limitations are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients must use a generic third-party authorization form) and the absence of fillable fields on any PDF form. The Swellbox portal partially compensates for the PDF's technical shortcomings, and the multiple electronic submission and delivery options keep the process accessible. A patient can successfully request their records without visiting the facility, but the process isn't designed around them.

# Rio Grande Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rio Grande Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Del Norte, Colorado. It offers a single downloadable PDF ROI form — a generic "Authorization for Release of Information" — used across both the hospital and its affiliated clinic. Importantly, the organization also provides embedded HIPAA-compliant JotForms on both the hospital and clinic patient records pages, giving patients an online submission pathway alongside the traditional PDF.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one PDF form was retrieved: **form-1.pdf**, a one-page "Authorization for Release of Information" created in Microsoft Word 2013 and uploaded in December 2018. The same PDF is linked from both the hospital and clinic records pages. In addition, each page embeds a separate JotForm (hospital JotForm ID: 220685534838162; clinic JotForm ID: 220685679526166) for online submission, providing a digital-first alternative to the downloadable PDF. The "FOR OFFICE USE ONLY" section on the PDF also references fax and mail as delivery methods used by staff.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Rio Grande Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses classic third-party authorization framing — "I authorize ___ to disclose my individually identifiable health information" — requiring the patient to fill in both a "To" and "From" entity. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should list Rio Grande Hospital as the "From" and themselves as the "To," which is workable but unintuitive. The form does include a "Personal Use" purpose checkbox, which is the closest acknowledgment that patients may be requesting records for themselves. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524, and no mention of electronic health information export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Web searches quickly surfaced the hospital's patient records pages, and the PDF had a descriptive URL. The JotForms are prominently featured on the pages, while the downloadable PDF sits in the sidebar — meaning the online pathway is actually more visible than the print form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was required.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable document with zero interactive form fields. Despite being digitally created (not a scan), it uses underscored blank lines for handwriting — a print-era design. At one page, it is appropriately concise. The layout follows a logical sequence (patient identity → parties → record types → HIV authorization → purpose → legal terms → signature), but the opening authorization paragraph is a dense, multi-line sentence covering communicable diseases, mental illness, and redisclosure warnings all at once. Record type options are limited to four checkboxes (History/Physical, Lab Results, X-Ray Reports, Other Diagnostic Reports) with no option for "all records," discharge summaries, medications, or billing. The form opens with "THIS REQUEST MUST BE FILLED OUT COMPLETELY" in emphasized text — a stern tone that could discourage patients uncertain about fields like SSN.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flag is the **SSN collection** — the form requests Social Security Number as a standard identifier alongside name and DOB, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk. The form also provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or reference to the online JotForm. A patient who downloads and fills the PDF has no clear next step. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeframe is stated. The form does not require notarization or a witness.

## Notable Strengths

The standout bright spot is the **online JotForm submission option**. While not part of the PDF itself, the organization provides a fully digital pathway for records requests via embedded web forms on both hospital and clinic pages. This is a meaningful investment in patient accessibility. The form's **non-conditioning language** ("I understand that my health care and the payment of my health care will not be affected if I do not sign this form") is a positive HIPAA compliance element. The **single-page format** keeps things concise. The HIV/STD/AIDS opt-in/opt-out structure with patient initials properly addresses Colorado's heightened protections for sensitive health information.

## Overall Assessment

Rio Grande Hospital provides a functional but dated records request experience. The PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no patient-access differentiation, no fillable fields, an unnecessary SSN field, and no submission instructions. However, the organization partially compensates with its JotForm-based online submission pathway, which gives patients a digital-first alternative. The best available pathway for a patient is the online JotForm, though the PDF form — the only downloadable document — falls short of modern patient-centered design. For a small independent critical access hospital, the investment in online forms is commendable, but the underlying authorization framework remains oriented toward third-party release rather than individual access rights.

# Nevada Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Nevada Health Centers (NHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Carson City, NV. The organization publishes three ROI-related forms on a well-organized patient forms page. All three are bilingual English/Spanish PDFs created in Adobe Illustrator, and none have fillable fields or an extractable text layer. The primary form for patient self-access is a general-purpose "Release of Medical Information" authorization — there is no dedicated patient access request form.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved from the forms page at `nevadahealthcenters.org/forms/`:

1. **Form-1** — "Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). This is the primary general-purpose release form, covering both patient-initiated requests and third-party releases via a "To/From" checkbox. It is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.
2. **Form-2** — "Authorization to Share Information" (2 pages, bilingual EN/ES). This is a proxy access designation form allowing patients to authorize family or friends to access information on their behalf. It does *not* serve patient self-access.
3. **Form-3** — "WIC Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). A WIC program-specific variant of Form-1, listing seven WIC clinic locations. Structurally identical to Form-1 with added clinic details.

The organization directs completed forms to its Support Services Department in Las Vegas. Fax numbers appear on the forms (and specifically on Form-3's clinic listings), and a mailing address is provided on Form-1. No online portal, email submission, or patient portal-based records request was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NHC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Form-1 uses a single "To or From" directional checkbox to handle both scenarios. A patient requesting their own records would check "To" (themselves) and provide their own contact information in the recipient fields — but the form's language and structure are oriented toward third-party release, asking for a recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524, the Right of Access, or any patient rights language beyond revocation rights. The form requires a "Reason for Request" (with options including "Personal"), which HIPAA does not require for patient self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **relatively easy**. A site-scoped search (`site:nevadahealthcenters.org`) identified the forms page within 2–3 steps. The page is well-organized by category (General Forms, Dental Forms, Mammovan Forms, etc.) with clearly labeled PDF links. However, generic web searches did not surface NHC-specific forms — results returned other Nevada healthcare organizations instead. A patient would need to navigate directly to the NHC website to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a clean, single-page design that packs bilingual content, multiple checkbox sections, and a signature block into a reasonably organized layout. The top-to-bottom flow is logical: patient identification → direction of release → record types → date range → confidential information → reason → signature.

However, significant technical and design issues undermine usability:

- **No fillable fields and no text layer**: All three PDFs were created in Adobe Illustrator with text rendered as vector paths. They have zero extractable text, zero embedded fonts, and zero interactive fields. Screen readers cannot read them, text cannot be copied or searched, and every field must be hand-filled after printing. This is an especially unfortunate choice because the documents are born-digital (not scans) — a word processor or PDF form tool would have preserved accessibility.
- **No "All Records" checkbox**: The form offers six specific record categories plus "Other" but lacks an option to request a complete record. A patient exercising their Right of Access to their full designated record set must check every box and potentially write additional categories.
- **Ambiguous witness line**: The signature block includes a "Witness" field without indicating whether it is required or optional, potentially creating a perceived barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **Inline bilingual compression**: English and Spanish share space on a single page, which keeps things concise but subordinates the Spanish text and reduces whitespace.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers**: No notarization is required. No fees are mentioned (neither disclosed nor explicitly waived). The 120-day default expiration is reasonable but on the shorter side. The witness field ambiguity is a minor concern. The primary barriers are technical: the completely non-digital workflow (print, handwrite, fax/mail) and the inaccessible PDF format.

**Bright spots**: The bilingual English/Spanish design across all three forms is a genuine strength for this FQHC's patient population. The granular confidential information opt-in/opt-out section (AIDS/HIV, behavioral health, alcohol/drug, social services) gives patients meaningful control over sensitive categories. The single-page form length is appropriately concise.

## Overall Assessment

Nevada Health Centers provides a findable, bilingual, concisely designed release form that a patient *can* use to request their own records — but the process was not designed with patient self-access in mind. The generic authorization form, the print-only workflow, and the complete lack of digital accessibility represent a paper-era approach that creates unnecessary friction. The organization earns credit for easy findability and inclusive bilingual design, but loses ground on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness. Overall grade: **C**.

# Maury Regional Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Maury Regional Health, a nonprofit regional system based in Columbia, TN (encompassing Maury Regional Medical Center, Marshall Medical Center, Wayne Medical Center, and Maury Regional Medical Group), provides a reasonably accessible records request experience with several notable strengths — particularly multilingual availability and multiple delivery channels — but falls short of best-in-class by relying on a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms were found, both linked from the Medical Records page (`/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/`):

- **Form 1 (Form 131, 08/2018):** English-language "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a single-page, general-purpose ROI form.
- **Form 2 (Form 131S, 05/2017):** Spanish-language translation of the same form, though dated over a year earlier and containing content discrepancies.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, the medical records page also offers an **online request portal via Swellbox** and access through the **My Maury Health Patient Portal**, giving patients three distinct channels. Fax submission (931.380.4092) and phone contact (931.380.4089) are also listed.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Maury Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form serves all purposes — requesting your own records, releasing to an attorney, sending to an insurer, etc. However, the form does accommodate patient access by listing "Myself" as the first option in the recipient field and including "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox. A patient can use this form, but must navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios (specifying a recipient name/address, selecting among purposes that don't apply). The availability of the Swellbox online portal is a meaningful alternative that may provide a more streamlined patient experience, though the portal itself was not evaluated in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A site-scoped search immediately surfaced the medical records page. The page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Medical Records). PDFs are hosted on Cloudinary CDN and downloaded without authentication or bot blocking. The only minor difficulty was a 403 error from the web_fetch tool on the medical records page, requiring browser fallback — but the PDFs themselves downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (Form 131) is a clean, single-page, digitally-created PDF — not a scan. It has a proper text layer enabling screen reader access and text search. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring handwriting after printing. The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (demographics → direction of release → purpose → date range → record types → format → consent → signature) and uses reasonable visual hierarchy with checkboxes and section groupings. Language is a blend of plain English and necessary legal terminology — the consent bullets are clearly written, though the sensitive information disclosure section is dense.

The form offers an unusually good set of **four delivery format options**: paper copies, CD, USB flash drive, and encrypted email — with a thoughtful security disclosure about email risks.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required.**
- **No fees disclosed** — the form says nothing about costs.
- **Hold harmless clause** is a red flag: "The facility is hereby released and discharged of any liability, and I will hold the facility harmless for complying with this authorization." HIPAA does not permit conditioning access on signing a liability release.
- **90-day authorization expiration** is relatively short but within norms.
- **Photo ID verification** on the English form implies in-person submission, though the website lists fax as an option.
- **No response time commitment** stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — uncommon among community hospitals in this study.
- **Multiple request channels** (PDF, Swellbox portal, patient portal, fax, phone).
- **Encrypted email delivery** option with proactive security disclosure.
- **"Myself" listed first** in the recipient field — a subtle but meaningful patient-centric design choice.

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must use a generic authorization form.
- **Non-fillable PDF** — requires printing and handwriting.
- **Spanish form is outdated** (05/2017 vs. 08/2018 English) with missing content (no Social Security/Disability purpose, no Photo ID section).
- **Hold harmless clause** is potentially noncompliant for patient access requests.
- **Sensitive information limitation** is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to exercise it.

## Overall Assessment

Maury Regional Health provides an accessible, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process with commendable multilingual support and multiple submission channels. The main shortcomings are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, a non-fillable PDF form, and a potentially problematic liability waiver. The availability of the Swellbox online portal partially compensates for the PDF's limitations, and the overall experience is adequate — a patient can successfully request their own records without undue difficulty, though the process could be more patient-centric.

# Barnes-Jewish Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJC HealthCare system) provides two distinct PDF forms on its Medical Records Requests page. **Form-1** is a dedicated patient access form titled "REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION BY INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS," designed exclusively for patients requesting their own records. **Form-2** is a general "Authorization For Release Of Information" form for third-party disclosures — attorneys, insurers, other providers. The website clearly separates these use cases, also listing links for next-of-kin requests, amendment requests, and Care Everywhere revocation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

This is where Barnes-Jewish stands out. Having a **dedicated patient self-access form** distinct from the third-party authorization is a genuine best practice that few organizations implement. The website's Medical Records Requests page explicitly categorizes "Individual requests" separately from "Third-party requests," so a patient arriving at the page sees an unambiguous path to the right form. The patient access form (revised 05/2022) uses right-of-access framing rather than authorization language — the patient is "requesting access" to their PHI, not "authorizing release." This is the correct legal framing under HIPAA § 164.524 and avoids confusing patients with irrelevant third-party authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The official website has a well-organized page at `/Patients-Visitors/Medical-Records-Requests` with direct PDF download links — no login, portal, or intermediary steps required. Standard web searches surfaced the page quickly. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. One potential source of confusion: the page notes that Washington University maintains separate medical records for WashU Clinic patients, which could leave some patients unsure whether they're requesting from the right entity.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF — admirably concise. It follows a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection (20 checkboxes) → date range → delivery preferences → signature → processing information. The "Abstract (includes all * documents)" checkbox is a clever shortcut — patients who want a comprehensive record can check one box instead of thirteen individual starred items. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery via email, a forward-thinking feature for a 2022 revision.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). Patients must print and fill by hand, then submit via fax (314-747-7211) or mail. This is the primary weakness: a form revised in 2022 should have interactive PDF fields as a basic digital accessibility expectation. The form does have a clean text layer, so annotation tools could work as a workaround, but it was not designed for that workflow.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes minimal barriers. No notarization or witness is required — just a patient signature and date. Fees are described in HIPAA-compliant language ("based on the cost of the labor and supplies"), though no specific fee schedule or estimate is provided. The 30-day response time is clearly stated, matching the HIPAA-mandated timeline, with a note about possible extensions.

The main red flag is the **Social Security Number request**. While the form offers "or last 4 digits" as an alternative, placing the full SSN as the primary ask collects more sensitive PII than necessary — a medical record number or date of birth should suffice. This is an unnecessary privacy risk in a patient access context.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party release — a best practice
- **Single-page design** that accomplishes a complete request without overwhelming the patient
- **Electronic delivery option** via email, with a dedicated field
- **"Abstract" checkbox** that bundles comprehensive records into one selection
- **Clear, plain-language** processing instructions with 30-day timeline

## Overall Assessment

Barnes-Jewish Hospital demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its records request process. The decision to create a dedicated patient access form — shorter, simpler, and legally distinct from the third-party authorization — reflects genuine attention to the patient experience. The website organization is exemplary. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a print-and-handwrite workflow despite the form being digitally authored. With interactive fields added, this would be a near-ideal patient access pathway. As it stands, the experience is good but not fully digital-first.

# UCSF Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UCSF Medical Center offers a single ROI form — the "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (756-020Zi, Rev. 04/22) — available in both English and Spanish. Two English PDF URLs exist (form-1 and form-2 contain identical text; form-2 at `/pdf/roi-authorization.pdf` is the current canonical version linked from the Medical Records page). The Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 05/22) is also directly linked. The UCSF Health Medical Records page (`ucsfhealth.org/medical-records`) additionally mentions MyChart as an alternative pathway for accessing records and discloses fees ($0.25/page paper, $25 electronic).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

UCSF does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. The authorization form is a general-purpose release designed for any disclosure — from continuity of care to billing to third-party requests. A patient wanting their own records must fill in both the "I authorize [source]" and "to release health information to [recipient]" fields, effectively authorizing release *to themselves*. While "At the request of the patient/patient representative" is available as a purpose checkbox, the form makes no distinction between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party requesting records. There is no mention of HIPAA's individual access right, no response-time commitment, and no EHI export option. MyChart provides a separate digital pathway, but the PDF form is the primary documented process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. The first web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link. The UCSF Health website has a clean, well-organized Medical Records page that links to both language versions, describes the process, and discloses fees. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-only rendering was encountered. The only minor wrinkle is two English URLs serving essentially identical PDFs, which could confuse a patient who finds the older link via search.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-crafted, digitally-authored 2-page PDF** with 39 fillable interactive fields. It is not a scan — it has a clean text layer, uses 14 fonts, and includes no embedded images. An accessibility note ("Made accessible 12/18" on form-1; "Made accessible 7/23" on form-3) confirms deliberate remediation for assistive technology. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → source/destination → purpose → record types → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Parenthetical examples for each record type (e.g., "Entire Hospital Record (e.g. History and physical, consult, operative report, discharge summary…)") help patients understand their options. The sensitive-information section correctly requires separate opt-in for substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing records, with California statute citations.

However, there are quality issues: a typo ("specifcally") appears in both English versions, and the Spanish version has three spelling errors ("fnalidad," "específca," "tratatmiento") plus a missing radiology request section that exists in the English versions — a meaningful content gap for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no excessive barriers**: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person submission mandate. Fees are disclosed on the website (not the form) at $0.25/page or $25 electronic — within HIPAA limits. The "Your Rights" section clearly states the authorization is voluntary, explains revocation rights, and notes the right to a copy.

The primary submission gap is that **general (non-radiology) requests must be mailed** to physical addresses in San Francisco or Oakland. Only radiology requests have fax and email submission options. The form itself provides no electronic submission path for general authorizations, creating a workflow disconnect: a patient can fill the form digitally but must then print and mail it.

## Overall Assessment

UCSF Medical Center earns credit for form findability, document quality, Spanish-language availability, and clean sensitive-information handling. The main weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients navigate a generic third-party release form), the mail-only submission requirement for general requests, and quality control gaps in the Spanish translation. The org demonstrates institutional attention to accessibility and transparency, but has not yet designed its records request process around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Boone County Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Boone County Health Center (BCHC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Albion, Nebraska. The organization provides a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests — there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway. Three documents were found: the current ROI form (form-2), a superseded 2017 version (form-1), and a HIPAA Contact Information form (form-3) that is explicitly not an ROI substitute.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The primary and only ROI form is form-2, "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information," uploaded in February 2026 as a Microsoft Word .docx file. This replaced an older PDF version (form-1, August 2017) that remains accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the website. The current form is a generic authorization that handles both outbound release ("Release Information To") and inbound record requests ("Obtain Records From") through a single check-one mechanism. While a "Patient Request" purpose checkbox exists, the form does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party authorization, and makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — basic web searches surfaced both the old and new versions, and the current form is listed on the Patient Forms section under Patient Resources > General Information. The main complication is that the current form is published only as a .docx file, which is unusual and less accessible than PDF. The website also requires JavaScript rendering to display form links. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page document with a logical flow: patient identification, release direction, purpose, date range, record types, sensitive information authorization, delivery format, legal acknowledgments, and signatures. It has zero fillable fields — all inputs are underscore blank lines, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The .docx format theoretically allows typing, but without proper form fields the experience is poor.

The layout is reasonably organized with clear sections, though the release direction framing ("Release Information To" vs. "Obtain Records From") is confusing for patients who simply want their own records. The sensitive information section has garbled instruction text from formatting issues. Language is generally plain and accessible, with concise legal acknowledgments. There are no instructions explaining how to submit the completed form, though the header provides phone, fax, and a dedicated ROI email address (Roi@boonecohealth.org).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is required. Fee disclosure is vague — the form states "copy fees may apply in accordance with Nebraska law" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access and third-party fees. A photo ID/witness requirement appears on the signature line but its scope is ambiguous — it may apply only to in-person pickup. The form includes a proper non-coercion statement, re-disclosure warning, 12-month fixed expiration, and revocation rights. No turnaround time is stated. A typo ("Heath" instead of "Health") appears in the legal section.

Submission methods include fax (402-395-2180), potentially email (Roi@boonecohealth.org is listed but not explicitly stated as a submission channel), mail, and in-person delivery. Fax availability means electronic submission is possible without visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

BCHC shows several bright spots unusual for a small critical access hospital: a dedicated ROI email address suggesting a staffed intake process, encrypted email as a delivery format option, and careful handling of sensitive information categories with separate initials required for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV/AIDS records per Nebraska law. The form is compact (2 pages) and avoids excessive legalese.

## Notable Weaknesses

The .docx-only publication format is a meaningful accessibility barrier. The lack of fillable fields means this is fundamentally a paper workflow. The generic authorization framing without any acknowledgment of patient access rights under HIPAA means a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for third-party release. The continued availability of the superseded 2017 form at its original URL creates confusion risk.

## Overall Assessment

Boone County Health Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is findable and the content is adequate, but it reflects a traditional paper-centric approach with no digital-first design or patient access differentiation. The bright spots — dedicated email, encrypted delivery, compact design — show genuine effort, but the .docx format, lack of fillable fields, and generic authorization framing hold back the overall experience. A patient can get the job done, but must figure out the process largely on their own.

# Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center: Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system, offers patients three distinct pathways to request medical records: **MyChart** (patient portal), **eRequest** (an online wizard powered by Swellbox/Datavant at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html), and a **downloadable paper form**. Fax (513-599-4503), email (MercyROI@datavant.com), and phone (844-835-1238) are also listed as contact channels for Springfield.

Four PDF documents were retrieved, but only two are relevant to Springfield patients. **Form-1** is from mercy.net (a separate Missouri-based Mercy system)—a false positive caused by the confusingly similar branding. **Form-2** is a Youngstown-region variant from the correct system but wrong region. **Form-3** is the system-wide authorization form currently linked on the website, but it is an **image-only scan** with only 46 characters of extractable text—functionally inaccessible to screen readers or digital filling. **Form-4** (MHP 0785 Rev 1/19) is the Springfield-specific authorization form with full text layer, but it is **not linked anywhere on the website**—it was discovered only by guessing the URL pattern (`mercy.com/-/media/.../springfield.ashx`).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. All PDF forms are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information"—generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release. Form-4 accommodates patient self-access via a "Self" checkbox and defaults the purpose to "For Personal use if not otherwise stated," which is patient-friendly. However, the form structure, title, and legal framing are oriented toward third-party authorization. A dedicated patient access request form (like the one from the Missouri mercy.net system, ironically) does not exist within Bon Secours Mercy Health's offerings for Springfield.

The eRequest portal via Swellbox/Datavant represents a potentially more patient-centric pathway, as it is an online records request wizard that may differentiate between request types. However, only the PDF forms were directly evaluated.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page was straightforward—`mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests` is well-organized with clear pathways. However, finding the **right PDF form** for Springfield was surprisingly difficult. The linked system-wide form (form-3) is an image-only scan—a 2024 regression from the 2019 text-based regional versions. The Springfield-specific text version exists at a predictable URL but is entirely undiscoverable through normal website navigation. Additionally, web searches conflated mercy.com (Ohio) with mercy.net (Missouri), producing a false-positive form from the wrong health system.

## Form Document Quality (Form-4, the Best Available PDF)

Form-4 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a full text layer—but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it requires printing and hand-filling. The layout is logical: patient demographics → facility selection → date range → record types (11 checkboxes) → recipient → format → delivery → legal disclosures → signature. The top half is clear and well-organized; the bottom half compresses six dense legal bullet points into small paragraphs with complex language ("Treatment, Operations or Payment disclosures to insurance companies when the law gives the right to the insurers to contest a claim under policy"). The form cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and offers four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email) with electronic format (PDF/CD) as the default—an uncommon patient-friendly choice.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable concerns emerge. First, **"Photo ID required at the time of request"** is stated in the header with no guidance on how this applies to fax or mail submissions, creating ambiguity that could deter remote requests. Second, **"Entire record (standard two years of information, unless otherwise specified)"** imposes a default time limitation that patients may not notice, potentially resulting in incomplete records when HIPAA's Right of Access covers the entire designated record set. Fee language is vague: "There may be a charge for copies of records" with no amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee distinction. No notarization is required, and multiple electronic submission methods are available (fax, email).

## Notable Strengths

The organization offers a genuinely multi-channel approach: MyChart, Swellbox/Datavant eRequest portal, and paper form with fax/email/mail submission. The electronic format default, personal-use default purpose, explicit § 164.524 reference, and MyChart delivery option are all bright spots. The form is available in English only—no multilingual versions were found for Springfield.

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center provides an **adequate but fragmented** patient records request experience. The eRequest portal and MyChart offer digital pathways, but the downloadable form—the fallback option—suffers from critical problems: the linked version is an image-only scan, the better text version is hidden, no forms have fillable fields, and the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access instrument. The result is a C-grade experience where digitally-savvy patients who find the portal do fine, but patients seeking a traditional form encounter unnecessary friction.

# Western Washington Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Everett, WA. Three ROI-related documents were retrieved: a primary organization-wide fillable authorization form (form-1), a GI department-specific non-fillable release form (form-2), and a generic unbranded authorization hosted on PatientPop (form-3). Form-1 is clearly the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records and is the basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WWMG does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Western Washington Medical Group to RELEASE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION" — a standard third-party release authorization. Patients requesting their own records use the same form as those authorizing release to an attorney, insurer, or another provider. "Personal (to patient)" appears as one of several purpose checkboxes, annotated with "*service fee may apply." There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal option for record requests. The form does not reference the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish individual access rights from third-party authorization. A patient must navigate a form designed around sending records to someone else and adapt it for self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search returned direct PDF links, and WWMG maintains a dedicated Medical Records Request page (wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/) that links to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or portal requirements were encountered. The URL is descriptive and the form is also listed on the Patient Intake and Registration Forms page. The only complication is the existence of three forms — a patient could potentially encounter the inferior GI-specific (form-2) or orphaned PatientPop form (form-3) instead of the primary one, though the website clearly surfaces form-1.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a single-page fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — well above average for healthcare ROI forms. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → record scope → sensitive information exclusions → purpose → expiration → signature. The language is relatively plain, with direct instructions like "PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE." The scope options are strong, offering four ways to define what records are released (all within 3 years, specific condition, specific dates, or mutual exchange). The sensitive information exclusion section gives patients granular control over HIV, STD, psychiatric, and substance abuse records using an opt-out model with required initials.

The form is not a scan — it was designed digitally with clean text, multiple fonts, and embedded branding. At 143 KB for a single page, it is appropriately sized. WWMG's address is pre-filled, reducing patient burden.

## Submission and Delivery

The form directs patients to "visit wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request and refer to the contact info on the chart" for submission instructions, rather than listing submission options directly on the form. The "OFFICE USE ONLY" section indicates records can be faxed, mailed, or emailed — confirming electronic submission pathways exist. This indirect approach adds a step but avoids restricting patients to in-person delivery. Fax availability means patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or witness signature is required. However, two issues stand out:

1. **Vague fee language**: The "*service fee may apply" note next to "Personal (to patient)" is concerning. HIPAA limits fees for patient access to reasonable, cost-based amounts, and this language provides no specifics, potentially discouraging patients or leading to overcharging.

2. **Misleading "ALL" scope**: The "ALL healthcare information" option is silently limited to the last 3 years. A patient seeking their complete history must use the "Specific DATES" option, but this limitation is not explained. The word "ALL" is misleading.

The 90-day default authorization expiration is adequate for patient access requests (HIPAA requires fulfillment within 30 days with one extension) but creates unnecessary re-authorization burden for ongoing provider exchanges. A conflicting 1-year expiration for the "mutual exchange" option adds confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — genuinely digital-first design
- Single-page format that fits all necessary elements concisely
- Strong scope options with granular sensitive-information exclusion controls
- Multi-clinic awareness field routing requests to the correct WWMG location
- Easy-to-find forms with a dedicated Medical Records Request page

## Overall Assessment

WWMG provides a technically competent, well-designed authorization form that is easy to find and fill out digitally. However, it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — patients must navigate a generic authorization form and select the "Personal" purpose checkbox. The vague fee language for patient access is a compliance concern. The form's document quality and digital-first design are above average, but the lack of a patient-centered access pathway keeps this from being an exemplary practice.

# Broward Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Broward Health, a government-owned regional health system in Fort Lauderdale, FL, offers a single general-purpose ROI authorization form ("Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Information") in four languages: English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese. The organization also provides an online records request wizard via Swellbox, a third-party vendor. The system operates multiple facilities (Medical Center, North, Coral Springs, Imperial Point, East Imaging Center, Weston), all sharing the same form and process.

## Access Pathway

Broward Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ROI form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both purposes, with a "MYSELF" checkbox alongside an "OTHER" option for third-party recipients. While this checkbox makes it possible for patients to request their own records, the form was not designed around the patient access use case — it requires a purpose statement (not required under HIPAA § 164.524 for patient access), applies minimum necessary language to all requests (which should not apply to individual access under 45 CFR § 164.502(b)(2)(v)), and includes a witness signature line that creates unnecessary procedural friction.

The Swellbox online wizard at `swellbox.com/broward-health-wizard.html` offers a potentially better digital pathway, though the PDF form appears to be the primary resource offered on the Medical Records Request page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The Medical Records Request page is reachable in approximately 3 clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Information Request → Medical Records Request) and is well-organized, listing all four language versions with direct download links plus the Swellbox option. However, **Cloudflare bot protection** blocked all direct `curl` download attempts, requiring browser-based retrieval. The English form URL was also case-sensitive, with the lowercase variant linked on the page failing — a subtle but real broken link.

## Form Document Quality

The form quality is a mixed picture. On the positive side, the form is a concise single page with a logical section flow: sensitive record classification, patient demographics, authorization and recipient designation, delivery method, purpose, date range, detailed record type checklist (~15 categories with date ranges for lab and radiology), patient rights disclosures, and signatures.

On the negative side, the **English version (form-1.pdf) is an image-only scan** — a grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no screen reader accessibility. This is the primary language version yet the worst quality artifact. The Spanish, Creole, and Portuguese versions are digitally created PDFs with text layers, but they too have **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The Spanish and Portuguese versions also have garbled text from font encoding errors in their expiration clauses. The form's footer references "ADDRESSOGRAPH" and carbon-copy routing ("WHITE - MEDICAL RECORD / CANARY - PATIENTS"), confirming its origin as a physical paper form from 2014 that has never been modernized.

Delivery options are limited to paper or **encrypted CD** — an anachronistic option in 2026 with no email, portal, or electronic transfer available through the form itself.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form includes a **witness signature line**, which is not required by HIPAA for patient access requests and could prevent patients from completing the form at home. A Broward Health authorized signature line is also present, suggesting the form may have been designed for in-person processing. No notarization is required. Fees are referenced vaguely ("reasonable charge" per CFR 164.524) without specific amounts. The website notes approximately 3 business days for processing. Fax submission is available at facility-specific numbers, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Exceptional multilingual support**: Offering the ROI form in four languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese) reflects genuine attention to South Florida's linguistic diversity and is rare among U.S. healthcare organizations.
- **Swellbox online portal**: Provides a fully digital alternative pathway for patients who cannot or prefer not to use the PDF.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 citation**: References the HIPAA Right of Access regulation directly in patient rights disclosures.
- **Granular record type selection**: The detailed checklist with date-range filtering gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.

## Overall Assessment

Broward Health demonstrates genuine effort in accessibility through multilingual forms and an online portal alternative, but the underlying form infrastructure is outdated and not patient-access-oriented. The 2014-era generic ROI authorization, image-only English scan, lack of fillable fields, witness requirement, and inappropriate application of minimum necessary language to patient requests all reflect an organization that has not modernized its records request process to match the spirit of HIPAA's individual access rights. The Swellbox portal partially redeems the experience, but the PDF pathway — which remains prominently offered — falls short of modern standards. **Grade: C.**

# Community Health Center, Inc. — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Middletown, Connecticut. Three PDF forms were retrieved: a standard English ROI authorization (form-2, Rev. 6/2019), a Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 7/2019), and a site-specific variant pre-filled for the Birth to Three early intervention program (form-1). The standard English form (form-2) is the most relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway and Patient Self-Access

CHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All three PDFs are variants of a single generic "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information" — a dual-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for both releasing records to third parties and obtaining records from other providers. However, the form does include an explicit self-request section: "If to ME, my records should be released via: Mail / Fax / Pick-Up / E-Mail." This accommodates patient self-access but does not distinguish it as a separate regulatory pathway (§164.524 Right of Access vs. §164.508 third-party authorization).

The patient forms page on chc1.com has transitioned from direct PDF links to Luma Health online portals for ROI requests. Two Luma Health links are now offered ("CHC to release health information to another agency" and "CHC to obtain health information from another agency"), suggesting the organization is modernizing its workflow. The site also references a myCHC patient portal for online record access. The legacy PDFs remain hosted in the WordPress uploads directory but are no longer linked from the patient-facing navigation.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability was **moderate**. The patient forms page is navigable, but the PDF forms themselves are legacy documents — discoverable only via web search or URL pattern guessing. The current site directs patients to Luma Health portals. No bot blocking or download difficulties were encountered; all PDFs downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-2) is a well-organized **single-page** document with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of disclosure → self-request delivery options → record type checkboxes → date range → sensitive information opt-ins → reason → expiration → legal notices → signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and a side-by-side column design for the "Release TO" vs. "Obtain FROM" paths.

The form is **not fillable** — zero interactive PDF fields despite being a digitally authored document. All blanks are underscored lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. Submission is via fax (860-343-7379) or mail (575 Main Street, Middletown, CT 06457). A patient would need to print the form, fill it by hand, and fax or mail it in.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though the legal disclosure paragraph at the bottom is dense. The form provides approximately 20 fields for a self-request (patient demographics, delivery method, record types, date range, reason, signature block). Record type options are granular (9 categories plus "Other"), and patients can specify date ranges and selectively exclude sensitive information.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fax submission is available, so physical delivery is not the only option. No fees are mentioned. The form states a 30-day fulfillment window, consistent with HIPAA requirements.

Two minor compliance concerns: (1) the form asks for a reason for the request (Legal, Transferring Care, etc.), which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA; and (2) the default scope is the last 3 years unless a broader range is specified — this could inadvertently limit patients who don't realize they must explicitly request their full record.

A typo persists in the legal text ("in response to his authorization" instead of "this authorization") across both English forms.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version** available — important for an FQHC serving a diverse Connecticut population
- **Email delivery** offered as a self-request option, which is uncommon and reduces barriers
- **Granular exclusion controls** for drug/alcohol information (patients can specify what to exclude, not just all-or-nothing)
- **Transition to Luma Health portal** suggests active modernization of the records request process
- **Single-page design** keeps the form concise and manageable

## Overall Assessment

CHC provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient self-access. The generic authorization form accommodates self-requests via a dedicated delivery section, and the availability of a Spanish translation and email delivery are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of fillable fields, the conflation of patient access with third-party release, the legacy status of the PDF forms, and minor compliance gaps (reason field, default 3-year scope) prevent the organization from scoring higher. The transition to Luma Health portals is promising but could not be fully evaluated. **Grade: C** — adequate with notable room for improvement.

# University of Texas Medical Branch — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UTMB provides three downloaded documents, but the most important distinction is between two form types: **Form 7033** ("Patients Request for Medical Records," form-1.pdf, dated April 2023) is a dedicated patient self-request form, while **Form 7032** (form-2.pdf, revised May 2024) is a general HIPAA authorization for third-party release. A third document (form-3.pdf) is an outdated 2016 version of Form 7032 hosted by Champion Records Service, a third-party ROI vendor. For a patient requesting their own records, **Form 7033 is the relevant document**.

UTMB also offers an online portal through Datavant/Swellbox as a digital alternative to the paper forms, and the medical records page references this option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UTMB earns genuine credit for maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access versus third-party release** — a design choice that relatively few organizations make. Form 7033 omits irrelevant fields (purpose of request, representative documentation requirements) and adds patient-relevant features (MyChart delivery, email delivery, email encryption disclosure). Form 7032, by contrast, has only a "Signature of Authorized Personal Representative" line with no patient signature option, and requires documentation of authority to act on the patient's behalf. This structural separation demonstrates intentional consideration of the patient self-request use case.

However, the forms do not cross-reference each other. A patient who finds Form 7032 (whether on UTMB's site or the third-party copy) has no indication that the more appropriate Form 7033 exists.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy to moderate**. A single web search surfaced UTMB's medical records page at `utmb.edu/utmbhealth/online-services/medical-records`, which lists forms with download links under a logical "Online Services > Request Medical Records" navigation path. The complication is that PDFs are hosted on SharePoint (`liveutmb.sharepoint.com`), which requires browser-based download — programmatic access (curl) returns login pages. For a typical patient using a web browser, this is a non-issue.

## Form Document Quality

Form 7033 is a **single-page, text-based PDF** with a clean text layer (no OCR artifacts, not an image scan). It flows logically: patient identification → recipient/delivery method → record scope → expiration → signature → submission instructions. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all fields must be completed by hand after printing or via PDF annotation tools. This is the primary technical shortcoming.

The form offers **four delivery options** for records: mail, fax, email, and MyChart Patient Portal. It also provides **three submission methods** for the form itself: mail, fax, and email (himrio@utmb.edu). The email submission option is a notable convenience that eliminates the need for a printer or fax machine.

Language is generally clear and functional, though institutional rather than warm. The email encryption risk disclosure is a model of transparent, plain-language communication. The form asks for approximately 10–12 fields (name, address, DOB, phone, recipient info, record scope, dates, signature).

## Barriers and Gaps

- **No fillable fields**: Despite digital distribution, the form cannot be completed electronically in standard PDF readers.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. HIPAA limits patient access fees to a reasonable, cost-based amount, but patients have no idea what to expect.
- **No turnaround time stated**: No response timeline is communicated.
- **No patient rights statement**: The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access or explain patient rights.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records are authorized in a single blanket statement with no opt-out mechanism for individual categories.
- **No multilingual support**: Notable for a Galveston, TX institution serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — email, fax, and mail are all available.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-request form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **MyChart portal delivery option** on the authorization form itself — few organizations integrate portal delivery directly into their ROI form.
- **Email submission** of the completed form at himrio@utmb.edu — lowers the barrier significantly.
- **Transparent email encryption disclosure** — clearly written, appropriately informative without being alarming.
- **Datavant/Swellbox online portal** as a digital alternative pathway.

## Overall Assessment

UTMB demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its structural decision to maintain separate patient and third-party forms, and through the variety of delivery and submission options. The organization clearly thought about the patient self-access use case. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (undermining the digital workflow), absence of fee/rights/turnaround information, and no multilingual support. The availability of email submission and an online portal partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF. Overall, UTMB earns a **B grade** — meaningfully better than average, with room for improvement in document interactivity and patient education.

# Black River Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Black River Memorial Hospital (Black River Falls, WI) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital operating under the "Black River Health" brand. The organization offers a single downloadable ROI form for patients requesting health records. There is no patient portal–based request pathway, no online submission wizard, and no dedicated patient access form — only a general-purpose "Release of Information Authorization" that serves all release scenarios.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one ROI-related form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page "Release of Information Authorization" linked from the Patient Resources page. The form covers both directions of information flow — releasing records from the organization and receiving records to it — and is designed primarily for facility-to-facility transfers. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this general-purpose form, selecting "Per Patient Request" as one of eight possible reasons for the release.

No online portal, email submission, or electronic request pathway exists. The form lists delivery format options for *receiving* records (Mailed, Faxed, Pick Up, CD) but provides **no instructions for how to submit the completed form** — no mailing address, fax number, or drop-off location. The only contact information on the form is the HIPAA Privacy & Security Officer phone number (715-284-5361). A patient would need to call to determine how to return the form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. It is linked from the Patient Resources page under a "Forms" section, labeled "Authorization to Disclose Information." A site-specific web search also surfaced the direct PDF URL immediately. The description on the website frames the form as being for sharing information "from other healthcare facilities or providers" — not explicitly for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Black River Memorial Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form funnels all requests through the same authorization workflow. While the form includes "Per Patient Request" as a reason option and page 2 contains a substantive patient rights section (right to receive a copy, refuse to sign, revoke, inspect, and prohibition of conditions), the form's structure assumes a third-party release scenario: Section 2 asks "who has the information" and Section 3 asks "where you want it sent." A patient requesting their own records must work within this framework, which isn't designed for them.

## Form Document Quality

The form has **severe technical accessibility problems**. Despite being created in Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 in 2025, the PDF renders virtually all text as images — 970 embedded images across 2 pages, with only 43 characters of extractable text. The form has zero fillable/interactive fields; patients must print and complete it by hand. This makes the form inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.

On the positive side, the visual layout is well-organized with numbered sections and clear headers using question-like phrasing ("Why the information is needed," "How would you like this information"). The form is a reasonable 2 pages in length. However, Section 2 confusingly mixes source facility checkboxes with information-type checkboxes (Alcohol Treatment, HIV Results), and Section 5 imposes a default 2-year scope if the patient doesn't specify a date range.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. The form mentions a "reasonable fee may be associated" for inspecting or copying records but provides no specifics on amounts or HIPAA fee limitations. No response time commitment is stated. The prohibition of conditions language is explicitly included — the organization cannot condition treatment or benefits on signing the authorization. A photocopy clause ("as valid as the original") is a patient-friendly touch.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Easy findability, explicit prohibition of conditions, photocopy validity clause, patient-friendly expiration (remains in effect until processed), and direct HIPAA Privacy Officer contact information.

**Red flags:** The near-total text inaccessibility of a modern Word-generated PDF is a significant barrier, particularly for patients with disabilities. The complete absence of submission instructions means a patient who downloads the form online has no idea how to return it. The lack of any dedicated patient access pathway means every patient must navigate a form designed for third-party releases.

## Overall Assessment

Black River Memorial Hospital provides an easy-to-find form with reasonable content and good compliance language, but the technical execution is poor and the patient access experience is an afterthought. The image-rendered PDF and missing submission instructions create unnecessary friction for a patient trying to exercise their right of access. **Grade: C.**

# Erie Family Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erie Family Health Centers, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Chicago, provides two downloaded ROI forms: an English version (form-1.pdf) and a Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are identical in structure — a single-page "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form. The organization also directs patients to MyChart (myeriehealth.com) as the primary records access pathway, referenced on a dedicated medical records request page at `/recordsrequest/`.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Erie does **not** offer a dedicated patient-access form. Both downloaded forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for bidirectional use: releasing records *to* a third party or receiving records *from* a third party. A patient requesting their own records must select "to Release to" and write their own name and address in the recipient fields — a process designed for inter-provider transfers, not individual access. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under the purpose section, which accommodates self-requests but does not differentiate the pathway. There is no separate, simplified form for patients exercising their Right of Access under § 164.524.

That said, the records request page promotes MyChart as the primary way to access records, which provides a true patient-access pathway. The PDF form functions as a secondary or fallback option.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search for "Erie Family Health Centers medical records release form PDF" returned the direct URL. The organization maintains a clearly labeled `/recordsrequest/` page that links both English and Spanish PDFs and also promotes MyChart. No bot blocking, login walls, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with **54 fillable fields**. It was designed for digital completion, not a scan. However, field names are not programmatically labeled (empty `fillable_field_names` array), which impairs screen reader accessibility. The layout is logically organized — patient identification, authorization direction, purpose, format, delivery method, record types, date range, sensitive-category permissions, rights statement, and signature — all on one dense page.

The language is reasonably clear for an authorization form, though the legal disclaimers at the bottom (addressing re-disclosure restrictions under Illinois mental health, substance abuse, and AIDS confidentiality laws) are dense and directed at the receiving party rather than the patient. The reference to "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" is cryptic — no pay scale is provided or linked, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs.

Format options include paper copy or "Electronic copy (CD-ROM)" — the CD-ROM reference is outdated. Delivery methods include encrypted email, pickup at an Erie facility, fax, and US postal mail. Encrypted email is a notable modern inclusion.

## Barriers

- **Copy of ID required** as a blanket requirement, with no alternative verification methods offered. For an FQHC serving populations that may lack government-issued ID, this exceeds what HIPAA mandates for identity verification.
- **Witness signature line** present with no indication of whether it is required or optional, potentially creating an unnecessary procedural barrier.
- **Fee opacity**: "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" references an undisclosed fee schedule. Patients cannot learn costs before submitting.
- **No notarization** required. No in-person submission requirement. Auto-expiration at six months is reasonable.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both English and Spanish versions are provided and linked side-by-side — appropriate and commendable for a Chicago FQHC.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: A modern, patient-friendly option that many organizations omit.
- **Dedicated records request page**: Clear `/recordsrequest/` page contextualizes forms and promotes MyChart as an alternative.
- **Granular record selection**: Nine specific record categories plus "Other" let patients request exactly what they need.
- **MyChart availability**: The patient portal provides a true digital-first access pathway beyond the PDF form.

## Overall Assessment

Erie Family Health Centers earns a **B grade** (3.70 weighted score). The organization makes its forms easy to find, offers bilingual versions, provides a fillable PDF with modern delivery options including encrypted email, and maintains a dedicated records page. These are genuine strengths, especially for an independent FQHC. However, the lack of a dedicated patient-access pathway (funneling all requestors through a generic third-party authorization form), the undisclosed fee schedule, the blanket ID copy requirement, and the ambiguous witness signature line prevent a higher score. The MyChart portal partially compensates by offering patients a true self-service pathway, but the PDF form itself — the focus of this evaluation — treats patient self-access as just another use case rather than a first-class right.

# Cone Health — Organizational Synthesis

## Overview

Cone Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Greensboro, NC, operating multiple hospitals and the Cone Health Medical Group (CHMG) physician practices. Four documents were found related to medical records requests: a primary English HIPAA Authorization form (form-1), its Spanish translation (form-2), a Request for Amendment form (form-3, not an ROI form), and a separate CHMG-specific ROI form (form-4) discovered only through web search. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a generic HIPAA authorization downloaded from the Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Differentiation

Cone Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "HIPAA Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-requests and third-party releases. The only differentiation is a checkbox in the Purpose section: "☐ Patient Request ☐ Legal ☐ Other." A patient requesting their own records must still complete recipient fields (name, address, fax, email) designed for third-party disclosures — effectively naming themselves as the recipient of their own information. The form never references the HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or frames the interaction as a patient exercising a legal right. Adding to the confusion, CHMG patients need a separate form (form-4) that isn't linked from the main website, and no guidance explains which form applies to which patient.

## Retrieval Experience

The primary form was **easy to find** — it is linked directly from a well-organized Medical Records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records/`. However, the site employs bot protection that blocks standard HTTP requests, requiring browser-like headers or a real browser for downloads. The CHMG form (form-4) was only discoverable via web search, not through website navigation — a notable findability gap for medical group patients.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields despite being a digitally-produced document (not a scan). All 20+ fields must be completed by hand after printing. This is especially notable because the CHMG form (form-4) includes 42 fillable fields, demonstrating the organization has the capability. The form is organized into 6 numbered sections with a clear logical flow (patient identification → recipient → purpose → facility → date range → information type → delivery method → rights/signature). However, the language is heavily administrative/legal: the Patient Rights section consists of 8 dense paragraphs, and information-type checkboxes use clinical terminology ("History and Physical," "Consultation Reports," "Operative Notes") that most patients would not understand.

The form offers 6 delivery methods including email — a bright spot. But critically, the form provides **no submission instructions** — no address, fax number, email, or guidance on where to send the completed authorization. The only address appears in the revocation clause. A patient must independently determine how to submit.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee charge for reproduction of medical records" with no amounts or reference to HIPAA fee limits. The form bundles authorization for all sensitive categories (reproductive health, mental health, STDs, genetic testing, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS) with no opt-out mechanism — a patient requesting a simple lab result must authorize disclosure of all sensitive information. The "Office Use Only" section requiring a Driver's License number implies in-person identity verification may be expected. The CHMG form compounds these issues with an embedded liability waiver ("hereby released from any legal responsibility or liability") that is not standard HIPAA language and may chill patient access rights.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** (form-2), professionally translated and linked alongside the English version
- **Email delivery option** offered with transparent security disclaimer
- **Granular record-type selection** with 18+ checkboxes including behavioral health subcategories
- **Recently updated** (December 2024), suggesting active form maintenance
- **Amendment form published** alongside ROI forms, appropriately serving the related HIPAA right

## Overall Assessment

Cone Health provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form that was designed primarily for third-party disclosures, with no dedicated pathway for individual access. The primary form's lack of fillable fields, absent submission instructions, bundled sensitive-category consent, and split between hospital and CHMG forms create a process that works but requires persistence and guesswork from patients. The Spanish translation and email delivery option are genuine bright spots, but they don't compensate for the fundamental design choices that make this a C-level experience.

# Consensus Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Consensus Health operates as a decentralized network of independent physician practices in New Jersey. Four documents were retrieved, but none is a dedicated patient records request form. The most relevant document for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf**, a generic, unbranded one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN — not on any Consensus Health website. The remaining three documents are Consensus Health–branded intake paperwork from Skylands Medical Group (a member practice): a general consent/disclosure/authorization form (form-2), a HIPAA acknowledgment (form-3), and a seven-page Notice of Privacy Practices (form-4). None of these serves as a patient-initiated records request mechanism.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Consensus Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The only ROI-adjacent form (form-1) is framed entirely as a third-party disclosure authorization — its language ("authorize the disclosure of information from my health record" to a named "Person/Organization/Facility") assumes records are being sent to someone other than the patient. There is no form, process, or web page designed for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The organization appears to direct patients to the athenahealth patient portal or to contact the office by phone, but no documented ROI workflow exists through either channel.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any relevant form was **extremely difficult**. The main Consensus Health website has no patient forms section. Extensive searching — direct navigation, URL guessing across multiple paths, site-specific searches, and PDF filetype searches — produced nothing. The generic ROI form was only found through a general web search linking to a PatientPop-hosted PDF loosely associated with Consensus Health practices. The Consensus Health–branded documents were discovered on a member practice's WordPress site (Skylands Medical Group), not on any Consensus Health–owned domain. A patient visiting consensushealth.com would find no path to an ROI form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available ROI document, is a bare-bones single-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects approximately 11 fields (patient name, record number, address, DOB, free-text information requested, free-text purpose, recipient name/address/phone, and signature/date). The layout is plain and functional, and the language is reasonably clear. However, the form is critically incomplete: it provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or any indication of where to send the completed form. It carries no organizational branding, so a patient cannot confirm it belongs to their provider. A patient completing this form would have no idea what to do with it.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No submission pathway**: The form provides zero information about how to submit it — a functional barrier that effectively renders the form unusable without outside knowledge.
- **Missing HIPAA-required authorization elements**: The form lacks an expiration date, revocation language, and the name of the disclosing entity — elements required under 45 CFR § 164.508(c) for a valid authorization.
- **"Record Number" field**: The form asks for a medical record number without explaining where the patient would find this.
- **Vague fee language**: The NPP (form-4) mentions "reasonable fees" for copies but provides no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **"Proprietary & Confidential" marking** on the NPP — an odd designation for a document HIPAA requires to be publicly available.

## Notable Strengths

- The **Notice of Privacy Practices** (form-4) is substantive and current (Version 2.0, 2025), including reproductive health care protections reflecting the 2024 HIPAA Final Rule and explicit acknowledgment of patients' right to electronic access.
- The NPP states a **30-day response commitment** for records requests, aligning with HIPAA standards.
- The consent form (form-2) has a well-designed **authorized individuals section** with granular health/payment disclosure options and a detailed **contact preferences** section.

## Overall Assessment

Consensus Health presents a significant challenge for patients seeking their own medical records online. The organization has no centralized patient forms infrastructure, no dedicated records request form, and no documented electronic submission pathway. The only ROI-adjacent form found is an unbranded, non-fillable, third-party authorization template that lacks essential information for a patient to act on it. While the athenahealth patient portal may offer an alternative pathway, this is not documented or promoted as a records request mechanism. The decentralized practice model means patients at different member practices may have different (and equally opaque) experiences. This organization's approach to patient records access is best characterized as an afterthought — not hostile, but functionally absent from its public-facing digital presence.

# DHR Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

DHR Health (formerly Doctors Hospital at Renaissance) in Edinburg, TX offers a single pathway for patients requesting their medical records: a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (DSR-GEN-71, dated August 2015), available in both English and Spanish from the Medical Records page. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no online portal, and no digital submission option beyond fax. The form is over a decade old, still carries the organization's former branding, and was designed for third-party release rather than individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents are available on the DHR Health website:

1. **form-1.pdf (English)** — A 2-page authorization form with a text layer and 37 unnamed fillable fields. This is the primary form for any records request.
2. **form-2.pdf (Spanish)** — An image-only scan of the same form, produced on a Konica Minolta copier. No text layer, no functional fillable fields, and several spelling/grammar errors in the Spanish text.

Both serve identical purposes: a bidirectional authorization that can route records either from or to the hospital. The form directs patients to choose between these two directions via an "OR" structure, with no guidance on which section applies to a patient requesting their own records. Submission is by fax or mail to the Health Information Management department; no online portal, email submission, or patient portal pathway was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DHR Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same form is used whether a patient wants copies of their own chart or an attorney is requesting records. There is no streamlined pathway, no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their own records. The form asks patients to state a "purpose" for the request — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access — without clarifying that this field is optional for patients requesting their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is **2 clicks from the homepage** (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and the download links are clearly labeled in English and Spanish. However, legacy URLs from a CMS migration return empty files, meaning patients following older search engine links will get broken downloads. The current URLs use CMS hash paths but have descriptive filenames.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) has a text layer and 37 fillable field annotations, but the fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader and auto-fill functionality. The form is not truly digital-first — it appears to be a designed layout with graphical elements, subsequently exported to PDF with fields added as an afterthought. The Spanish version is materially worse: a flat image-only scan with no text layer, no searchable text, and no assistive technology support, creating a two-tier accessibility gap.

The layout uses a cramped, checkbox-heavy design with multiple columns and 16 embedded images across 2 pages. The language is legalistic but not impenetrable, though the psychiatric/substance abuse/HIV consent section is a particularly dense compound sentence that would confuse most patients. The Do/Do Not consent mechanism via initials is ambiguous in its construction.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Social Security Number required** — The form requests a full SSN with no indication it is optional, creating identity theft risk for a document submitted by fax or mail.
- **Purpose field without exemption** — Patients are asked to justify their request, which HIPAA does not require for individual access.
- **Witness signature line** on the Spanish form adds an unnecessary step.
- **Liability waiver bundled** into the authorization on the Spanish form, asking patients to release the hospital from "all legal liability and any harm" from disclosure.
- **No fee disclosure** — The form says nothing about costs for copies.
- **No expiration clause** on the English form (the Spanish version defaults to 180 days).
- **No patient rights statement** — No reference to the right to access, right to revoke, or right to electronic format.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful in the Rio Grande Valley, where ~90% of the population is Hispanic/Latino. Offering a Spanish form, despite its quality issues, is a genuine accommodation.
- **Granular record type selection** — The ~20-item checkbox list gives patients meaningful control over what they're requesting.
- **Easy website navigation** — The form is prominently placed and easy to find via the main site navigation.

## Overall Assessment

DHR Health provides the bare minimum for patient records access: a downloadable PDF authorization form that is easy to find but poorly designed for patient self-access. The form is a decade-old generic release authorization that does not acknowledge individual access rights, requires unnecessary personal information (SSN), and bundles concerning liability language. The Spanish version's image-only format creates an equity gap. The organization would benefit from a modernized, patient-centered access form — or ideally an online request portal — that separates individual access from third-party release and removes unnecessary barriers.

# Merit Health Central — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Merit Health Central is a for-profit community hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, part of Community Health Systems (CHS) operating under the Merit Health brand. The facility uses system-standardized forms for records requests and also offers an online portal alternative via Swellbox. Two PDF forms were retrieved — English (HIM-1406) and Spanish (HIM-1406S) versions of the same document — both linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page.

## Available Pathways & Primary Form

The primary form (form-1.pdf, HIM-1406) is titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** — notably not "Authorization for Release" or similar third-party-oriented language. The form allows patients to request records for themselves, a personal representative, or a third party, with "Myself" listed as the first recipient option. A Spanish translation (form-2.pdf, HIM-1406S) with identical structure and 66 fillable fields is provided alongside. The website also offers an online request process via Swellbox (swellbox.com/merit-health-jackson-wizard.html), giving patients a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Merit Health Central does not maintain separate forms for patient self-access vs. third-party release — both use cases are served by the same HIM-1406 form. However, the form is clearly designed with patient self-access as the primary use case: the title, structure, and "Myself" first-option framing all signal a patient-access orientation. The form explicitly distinguishes recipients (self, personal representative, third party) with labeled options. This is a meaningful step above the generic third-party authorization model, even though a truly separate patient access pathway does not exist.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/request-medical-records`. The page sits under "Patients & Visitors" navigation with clearly labeled English and Spanish download links. An FAQ section addresses common questions about authorization, charges, and who can request records — providing useful context before the patient downloads anything. No bot-blocking or browser fallback issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a born-digital, single-page interactive PDF with 66 fillable fields — an exceptionally high count that means virtually every input area is digitally completable. The layout follows a logical seven-section flow: patient information, facility identification, record type selection (12 checkbox categories), sensitive information disclosure (5 categories with individual opt-in checkboxes), delivery method selection, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and direct, with clear section headers framed as patient-facing questions. The one-page format is impressively concise given the coverage.

The form offers five delivery methods: paper, email (with risk acknowledgment), removable media (DVD/USB/CD-ROM with password protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media with password protection is an unusually thoughtful option. The HIPAA acknowledgment in the footer — "This Healthcare Facility recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information" — explicitly references patient rights, though it could be more prominent.

## Barriers & Concerns

No major barriers were identified. No notarization is required, there is no in-person-only submission requirement, and the form avoids consent bundling. However, three ambiguities merit attention: (1) fee disclosure is vague — "There may be charges" with no amounts, schedules, or reference to HIPAA cost-based limits; (2) the form itself does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization (no fax number, email, or mailing address on the form); and (3) a witness signature field is present without explanation of when a witness is required, which may confuse patients completing the form remotely.

## Notable Strengths

The Spanish translation is a genuine bright spot — a fully functional, equally prominent parallel form rather than an afterthought. The Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital alternative for patients who prefer not to deal with PDF workflows. The patient-first titling and structure, comprehensive delivery options, and high fillable field count collectively demonstrate above-average attention to patient access needs. The system-standardized form (revised six times since 2018) suggests ongoing maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Merit Health Central provides a well-above-average patient records request experience. The combination of a patient-focused PDF form, Spanish translation, and online Swellbox portal covers multiple access modalities. The form's digital-first design, logical layout, and comprehensive options serve patients well. Minor shortcomings — vague fee language, missing submission instructions on the form itself, witness field ambiguity — prevent a top-tier rating but do not materially impede patient access. This is a solid B-level performance.

# UF Health Shands Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UF Health Shands Hospital, a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Gainesville, Florida, offers patients a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all record requests. Four versions of this form (form family PS46283/RI0001) were found online, but only one — form-2.pdf, revised 5/30/19 — is linked from the official medical records page. No dedicated patient self-access pathway exists; patients requesting their own records use the same authorization form designed for third-party release.

## Forms and Pathways

The primary form (form-2.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF linked from ufhealth.org/medical-records. Three additional variants persist online: form-1.pdf (a 2015 revision with more detailed identity verification and numbered sections), form-3.pdf (a 2014 legacy version with a liability waiver and HealthPort electronic delivery), and form-4.pdf (a clinic-specific variant pre-filled for the Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment). All share the same form code and general structure. The coexistence of multiple undifferentiated versions at different URLs creates a risk that patients or providers encounter outdated forms via search engines.

Submission options are mail and fax, both clearly printed on form-2. The medical records page also lists a phone number. An in-person pick-up option is noted on the form. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway per the scoring baseline.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UF Health Shands does **not** offer a differentiated patient self-access pathway. The form is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — the HIPAA authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than the Right of Access framework (§ 164.524). The sole accommodation for patients requesting their own records is a small "Check here if same as patient" checkbox in the "To" field. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, does not distinguish fee structures for patient access versus third-party release, and does not include any language framing the request as an individual access right.

That said, the form does include "Personal Use" as an explicit purpose option, and the identity verification fields in the representative section are marked "Internal use only," appropriately sparing patients from producing documentation at the time of form completion.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a cleanly designed, born-digital single-page PDF — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally composed (8 fonts, no embedded images, only 95 KB), the form requires printing and handwriting. This is a persistent gap across all four form versions, suggesting an organizational decision rather than a legacy issue.

The layout is logical: patient demographics → from/to routing → facility selection → record types → dates/purpose/format → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. Sixteen record-type checkboxes (including separated sensitive-information categories for behavioral health, substance use disorder, STD/HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing) provide excellent granularity. The legal disclosure section uses reasonably clear language with helpful parentheticals (e.g., "revoke it in writing (i.e., tell UF Health to cancel it)"), though the opening corporate entity definition paragraph is dense legalese.

Delivery format options include MyUFHealth (the patient portal), CD, and paper — the portal option is a notable modern addition, though it serves as a delivery mechanism rather than a request submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization, witness signatures, or in-person submission is required. Authorization expires after one year with clear revocation rights. However, the fee disclosure — "up to $1.00 per page (plus applicable tax and handling) for Paper Records" — is applied uniformly without distinguishing patient access from third-party release. For patient self-access under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4), HIPAA limits fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts; the $1.00/page rate (reflecting Florida's statutory schedule for third-party releases) may exceed this standard. No response time commitment is stated.

The older form-3 includes a liability waiver ("I hereby release and discharge UF Health...from any liability"), which is an additional barrier not present in the current primary form.

## Overall Assessment

UF Health Shands provides an easily findable, well-organized, and compact authorization form, but falls short in two critical areas: (1) the complete absence of fillable PDF fields forces a paper-based workflow, and (2) the generic authorization framework fails to differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The fee language, while standard for Florida third-party releases, is potentially non-compliant when applied to patient access requests. The form earns credit for its granular record-type selection, explicit "Personal Use" purpose option, MyUFHealth portal delivery, and patient-friendly touches like marking verification fields as internal-use-only — but these bright spots don't compensate for the fundamental lack of a patient-centered access pathway and the print-and-handwrite workflow.

# Ben Taub Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ben Taub Hospital is a government-owned community hospital in Houston, TX, part of the **Harris Health System**. It uses system-level forms for medical records requests — both downloaded PDFs are branded Harris Health documents, not Ben Taub–specific materials.

## Forms & Pathways

Two forms were retrieved. **Form-1** ("Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information") is the sole relevant document for a patient seeking their own records. **Form-2** is a marketing/media authorization unrelated to patient record access. Only form-1 is assessed below.

The medical records page at harrishealth.org clearly explains the request process and offers four submission channels: **mail, fax, email, and in-person drop-off**. Contact details — including phone (346-426-0980), fax (346-426-0959), and a dedicated email (Releaseofinformation@harrishealth.org) — are printed directly on the form. A patient can fill the form digitally and submit via fax or email without visiting the facility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Harris Health uses a **single dual-purpose authorization form** for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form handles this well through conditional sections: the "Purpose of Request/Disclosure" and "Expiration" sections are explicitly marked as "only required if the individual providing this authorization form to Harris Health is someone other than the patient." This means patients can skip irrelevant sections without needing a separate form. It is not a dedicated patient access form, but it clearly accommodates patient self-access as a first-class use case.

The email delivery option is labeled "Email Address (Patients Only)," further demonstrating that patient access is specifically considered in the form's design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and it is directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or rendering issues were encountered. The PDF URL is descriptive and identifiable in search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **65 interactive form fields** — a strong digital-first design. However, the fields lack programmatic names, reducing accessibility for screen readers and auto-fill. The form covers patient identification, recipient details, facility selection (with Ben Taub specifically listed), 14+ record type checkboxes, format options (paper, CD, email), sensitive information consent, and signature blocks — all on one page.

The layout is **dense but logically organized**, flowing from patient info → recipient → records scope → format → purpose → expiration → signatures. Section headers are minimal, and the cramped single-page layout sacrifices visual clarity for compactness. Language is moderately clear, leaning toward legal/administrative phrasing, but includes a well-worded non-conditioning statement. The form was recently revised (December 2024), suggesting active document management.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization is required and no fees are mentioned. Multiple submission channels are available. One notable concern: the form includes a **witness signature line** without clarifying whether a witness is truly required or who qualifies. This could be a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.

The form's footer includes an **internal intranet URL** (apps.hchd.local) — inaccessible to patients and a document-control oversight. The fillable fields lack programmatic names, an accessibility deficiency.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery explicitly for patients** — the "Patients Only" label on the email option is a meaningful patient-access accommodation
- **Conditional sections** that let patients skip third-party–only fields
- **Granular record type selection** with 14+ categories and proper psychotherapy notes separation
- **Multiple submission channels** with contact details printed on the form
- **Dedicated authorization withdrawal email** (AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org)

## Overall Assessment

Ben Taub Hospital, through Harris Health System, provides a **competent, accessible records request process**. The form is findable, fillable, and submittable electronically. While it uses a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, it thoughtfully accommodates patient self-access through conditional sections and patient-specific features like email delivery. The witness signature ambiguity and unnamed form fields are the primary weaknesses. Overall, this represents a solid B-level experience — functional and reasonably patient-friendly, with room for improvement in form clarity and dedicated patient access design.

# Prevea Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Prevea Health is an independent nonprofit physician practice based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It offers a single authorization form — an "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (PRV_839, rev. 0118) — as its primary mechanism for patients to request their own medical records. The same form is available in four languages: English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. No separate patient access–specific form or online portal was identified.

## Access Pathway

Prevea Health uses a **generic HIPAA authorization form** rather than a dedicated patient access form. However, the form explicitly accommodates patient self-requests: Section 3 ("To Disclose To") includes a "Self" checkbox with delivery options (pick up, mail, on-site viewing, electronic format, and email with encrypted/unencrypted options). Section 7 ("Purpose") includes "Patient Request" as a named checkbox option. While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, the form clearly signals that patients can use it for their own records — placing it above average among generic authorization forms.

The form does not differentiate the legal basis for patient self-access (HIPAA § 164.524) from third-party release (§ 164.508), but the practical workflow is reasonably clear for a patient who wants their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and the form is directly linked from the Patient Forms and Documents > Medical Records page at prevea.com. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was encountered. The URL is descriptive. This is a model for how organizations should make forms accessible.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally-created PDF** — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. A patient must print and hand-fill the form (or annotate it in a PDF viewer). This is the form's most significant technical limitation. The layout is logically organized into nine numbered sections with clear headings, and the single-page format keeps things concise. However, the density required to fit everything onto one page makes the rights section (Section 8) extremely cramped and difficult to read.

Section 8 is the form's weakest content area: a ~200-word paragraph of dense legalese with complex nested clauses that would challenge most patients. The rest of the form uses reasonably plain language with clearly labeled fields and checkbox options.

The form provides granular record-type selection (12 categories plus a free-text field) and includes opt-out checkboxes for sensitive information (alcohol/drug abuse, HIV results, mental health) consistent with Wisconsin law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Barriers

- **No notarization required.** Witness signature is needed only for AODA/Mental Health disclosures, consistent with legal requirements.
- **Fees:** The form states "copy fees may apply" but does not disclose specific amounts — neutral but not fully transparent.
- **Date range default:** If left blank, only records from the past two years are disclosed. This restrictive default is a notable red flag — patients seeking complete records must affirmatively specify a date range, which is unintuitive.
- **Submission instructions absent:** The form provides no guidance on where or how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, mailing address, or email for the HIM department. A patient who downloads and completes the form has no clear next step.
- **Minor errors:** "42 CRF" (should be CFR) and "e-email" (doubled prefix) suggest limited quality review.
- **HSHS references:** The form references "HSHS" (Hospital Sisters Health System) without explanation, which may confuse patients who know only Prevea Health.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — rare among physician practices and reflective of local demographics.
- **Five delivery options** including electronic format and email with encrypted/unencrypted distinction — well above average.
- **Explicit self-request pathway** via the "Self" checkbox and "Patient Request" purpose option.

## Overall Assessment

Prevea Health provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience with genuine accessibility strengths (multilingual forms, electronic delivery options, easy findability). The primary weaknesses are the non-fillable PDF format, missing submission instructions, a restrictive date range default, and dense legalese in the rights section. The form serves patients adequately but falls short of best-in-class due to its paper-oriented workflow and the absence of submission guidance.

# West Tennessee Healthcare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

West Tennessee Healthcare (Jackson, TN) is a government-owned regional health system that demonstrates an above-average approach to patient record access by maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** (form-3) separate from its third-party release authorization (form-2) and an older clinic-level release form (form-1). The organization also offers an online request portal via ScanSTAT and publishes Spanish-language versions of its key forms. However, the forms themselves are not fillable PDFs, and some legacy legal language undermines the patient-centered intent.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all linked from a clearly labeled medical records page at wth.org/request-medical-records/:

- **Form-3 (primary)**: "Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — explicitly subtitled "To be used when patient wants to access their own medical record or allow a personal representative to do so." This is the most relevant form for patient self-access. It offers five delivery methods: paper, fax, CD/DVD, portal, and email (encrypted or unencrypted). Two pages, ~3,300 characters.
- **Form-2**: "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" — a third-party release authorization. One page, similar structure but without the portal delivery option.
- **Form-1**: "Medical Release Authorization" — an older (2019) form specific to the West Tennessee Medical Group Clinics. Functions as a general release for discussing care with designated individuals.

Additionally, the medical records page links to a **ScanSTAT online request portal** for hospital records, providing a fully digital alternative pathway. Spanish versions of forms 2 and 3 are also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

West Tennessee Healthcare clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release — a practice that relatively few organizations follow. Form-3 uses "request" language (appropriate for HIPAA § 164.524) rather than "authorization" language, and includes a portal delivery shortcut ("If choosing portal, please proceed to signature line. No other action needed"). The medical records webpage provides context to help patients choose the correct form. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The layout is logical — flowing from identification to delivery method to record selection to legal terms to signature — but relies on underscored blank lines and an initials-based record type selection system (15 categories). The language is moderately accessible in the patient-facing sections but becomes denser in the five legal "I understand" statements. No section headers divide the form; the structure relies on spatial layout and field labels. At two pages, the length is proportionate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search returned direct PDF links, and the medical records page is clearly labeled and well-organized. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The page provides good context about when to use each form.

## Barriers and Concerns

Two compliance issues stand out on form-3:

1. **Liability waiver**: "The facility is hereby released from any liability and the undersigned will hold the facility harmless for complying with this request." Requiring patients to waive liability to exercise their Right of Access is problematic under HIPAA.
2. **90-day expiration on an access request**: This language was carried over from the authorization form and is conceptually inappropriate — a patient access request is a one-time action, not an ongoing authorization that needs to expire.

Additional minor concerns include the driver's license requirement for non-in-person requests, SSN collection (last 4 digits), no fee disclosure, and no explicit statement of patient rights or response timeframe. The form also omits the non-conditioning statement that appears on form-2.

## Bright Spots

- **Dedicated patient access form** with clear purpose statement
- **ScanSTAT online portal** as an alternative digital pathway
- **Spanish-language versions** of both key forms
- **Multiple delivery options** including portal and encrypted email with risk disclosure
- **Easy findability** from a well-organized medical records page

## Overall Assessment

West Tennessee Healthcare shows genuine patient-centered intent by distinguishing patient access from third-party release and offering multiple pathways including an online portal. The organization loses points for non-fillable PDFs, legacy legal language (liability waiver, expiration clause), and missing rights/fee information. The structural approach is strong, but the execution — particularly the form document quality and some compliance details — keeps this from being a top-tier example. Overall, a solid B-level performance that could reach A-level with fillable fields and cleaned-up legal language.

# Piedmont Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Piedmont Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Rock Hill, SC, affiliated with Tenet Healthcare. Two authorization forms were found: a one-page hospital-specific form (form-1) and a two-page physician network form (form-2). The organization also contracts with Datavant and offers Swellbox online portals for both patient and provider record requests, which represents the most patient-friendly pathway.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The hospital's "Request Medical Records" page at piedmontmedicalcenter.com/patients/request-medical-records serves as the central hub, linking to: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (form-1), and (2) a Swellbox/Datavant online portal for patient record requests. A second PDF form (form-2) exists on the affiliated Piedmont Physician Network website but is not linked from the hospital's main medical records page.

Form-1 is the primary PDF document for hospital record requests. It is a single-page "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" form (EZ-7003, revised 2013). The Swellbox portal, however, is likely the pathway the organization most actively directs patients toward for digital submission.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither PDF form is a dedicated patient-access form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 does include a "Self" checkbox under the PURPOSE section, acknowledging that a patient may be requesting their own records, but the form's framing ("I authorize Piedmont Medical Center to disclose the following information...") and structure assume a third-party recipient scenario. Form-2 is even more clearly a third-party release form, with fields for "Name of Person or Class of Persons who may disclose" and "To release records to" — a structure that makes no sense for self-access.

The Swellbox portal provides a meaningful alternative. By offering separate portals for patient and provider requests, the organization does create some differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — though this differentiation exists at the portal level, not in the PDF forms themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately returned the medical records page URL and direct PDF links. The medical records page is well-organized and clearly labeled. The only technical hurdle was Cloudflare bot protection blocking automated downloads, requiring browser-based retrieval — a hosting infrastructure issue that could also affect assistive technologies.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1** (primary hospital form) is a non-fillable PDF with zero interactive fields. Despite having labeled fields for patient name, date of birth, address, and various checkboxes for record types, all are static text requiring print-and-fill completion. The form is compact at one page with a logical layout organized into PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION REQUESTED, PURPOSE, and INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO sections. Record type options are granular, with 14+ checkboxes covering specific document types plus a write-in option.

The language is moderately legalistic, particularly the liability release and re-disclosure clauses. Template merge fields (`«PatientNumberBarcode»`, `«PatientName»`, etc.) are visible at the bottom of the public PDF, indicating an unprocessed template extracted from the hospital's document management system — confusing for patients and unprofessional in appearance. A typo ("in ability" for "inability") in the legal representative attestation is concerning for a legal document.

**Form-2** (physician network form) is more comprehensive at two pages but also entirely non-fillable. Its standout feature is granular opt-in checkboxes for seven categories of highly confidential information (mental health, psychotherapy notes, HIV/AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, sexual assault, child abuse/neglect). However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, carries no organizational branding, has a date field locked to "200_" (rendering one term option unusable since 2010), and provides no Privacy Office contact information.

## Barriers and Compliance

Neither form requires notarization or in-person submission. Neither mentions fees. Both include standard HIPAA disclosures: revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warnings. Form-1's six-month default expiration is reasonable. The liability release clause on Form-1 — releasing the hospital "from any legal responsibility or liability" — is unnecessary for patient self-access and could discourage patients from exercising their rights. Both forms are notably outdated (2013 and pre-2010 respectively), predating significant regulatory updates.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** for patient record requests provides a modern digital pathway beyond the paper forms
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear organization and multiple access options
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** (14+ options on form-1) give patients meaningful control
- **Granular sensitive information opt-in** on form-2 (seven separate categories) represents strong practice

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — both PDFs are generic third-party authorization forms
- **Zero fillable fields** on either form — entirely print-and-fill
- **Severely outdated forms** (one from 2013, one from pre-2010)
- **Visible template merge fields** on form-1 indicate an unprocessed internal template
- **SSN requested** on form-2 (unnecessary privacy risk)
- **Liability release clause** on form-1 (inappropriate for patient self-access)

## Overall Assessment

Piedmont Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional patient records request experience. The organization's investment in a Swellbox/Datavant online portal significantly improves the digital pathway, compensating for PDF forms that are entirely paper-oriented and outdated. The medical records page is easy to find and well-organized. However, the underlying PDF forms show their age — neither has been updated in over a decade, neither offers fillable fields, and neither is designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. The organization earns a B grade, buoyed by the portal alternative and reasonable findability, but held back by paper-era form design and a generic authorization approach that doesn't center patient access rights.

# Sturdy Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Sturdy Memorial Hospital (Attleboro, MA) publishes two PDF authorization forms on its website, both titled "Authorization to Release Health Information." Form-1 (updated January 2025, form code SM00081 10/24) is the current, actively maintained version — a 2-page fillable PDF with 59 interactive fields. Form-2 is an older (~2017) legacy version of the same document with zero fillable fields, outdated terminology ("Venereal Disease"), and defunct department references. Form-2 remains publicly accessible, creating a risk that patients download the wrong version. There is no redirect, banner, or other mechanism steering patients to the current form.

No online portal, patient portal integration, or third-party vendor (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was identified for records requests. The only documented pathway is downloading and completing the PDF authorization form, then submitting it — presumably by mail or fax, though the form itself does not specify a submission method. The hospital's mailing address (211 Park Street, PO Box 2963, Attleboro, MA 02703-0963) is listed in the revocation instructions.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Sturdy Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both form versions are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms structured around a three-party model: the patient authorizes Provider A to release records to Provider B. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in the "Release of Protected Health Information To" field — an unintuitive workaround that the form does not explain. The "Purpose of Disclosure" checkboxes include "Personal," the closest match for self-access, but this option is neither highlighted nor explained. The form does not reference the patient's HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), nor does it mention the right to inspect or obtain copies of one's own records as a distinct use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search immediately surfaced both PDFs as direct links on sturdyhealth.org. No website navigation was needed. However, Akamai CDN bot protection blocked programmatic downloads (curl returned "Access Denied"), requiring a browser-based JavaScript workaround to retrieve the raw PDF bytes. This would not affect a typical patient using a web browser but could impede assistive-technology or API-based access.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

The current form is a standout in technical execution. With 59 fillable fields, it is comprehensively interactive — patients can complete the entire form electronically without printing. The PDF is a native digital document (no scanned images, full text layer, 221 KB file size). The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → authorization source/recipient → sensitive information categories → purpose of disclosure → record types → rights → signature. The form uses clear section organization across its 2 pages.

Language is mixed: the rights section uses accessible plain English ("I may refuse to sign this authorization and that such refusal will not affect my health care"), while the sensitive information and disclosure sections are more legalistic. No plain-language summary or introductory guidance is provided. The form is English-only.

Record-type granularity is a notable strength — approximately 14 categories with individual date-range fields (medical record abstract, clinic visit notes, emergency room, lab reports, radiology, pathology, operative reports, etc.), giving patients meaningful control over scope. Sensitive information categories (mental health, HIV/AIDS, STD, sexual assault, substance abuse, genetic testing) require individual initials, respecting Massachusetts law and patient autonomy.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **90-day hard expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signature, with no option to specify a custom date (the older form-2 allowed this). Given HIPAA's 30-day processing window with a possible 30-day extension, this leaves a narrow margin.
- **Ambiguous witness requirement**: A "WITNESS" line appears at the bottom of page 2 with no instructions on whether a witness is required. Patients may unnecessarily delay submission while seeking a witness.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs for records copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No electronic delivery option**: No checkbox for email, portal, or electronic format delivery of the requested records.

## Bright Spots

- **59 fillable fields** — exceptional among ROI forms, most of which have zero interactive fields. Clearly a deliberate digital-first design decision.
- **Granular record-type selection** with ~14 categories and date ranges.
- **Individual sensitive-information consent** via initials for each category.
- **Active form maintenance** — the January 2025 update shows ongoing attention.
- **No notarization requirement**, no consent bundling, and clear right-to-refuse language.

## Overall Assessment

Sturdy Memorial Hospital delivers a technically excellent form that falls short on patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF with granular record selection is among the best form documents in its class, but the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway means patients must navigate a third-party release form to exercise their Right of Access. The form's structure, language, and field design all orient toward provider-to-provider or provider-to-insurer disclosure rather than patient self-access. Combined with ambiguities around witness requirements, submission methods, and a restrictive expiration, the experience is functional but not patient-centered.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MUSC Health University Medical Center in Charleston, SC is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina health system. The organization provides three pathways for patients to request their medical records: a downloadable PDF authorization form, MyChart patient portal, and an online Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool. Three documents were retrieved: the English authorization form (form-1), a MyChart instructional guide (form-2), and a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway Assessment

MUSC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary pathway is a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form that serves both patient access and third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same "Release Records From" / "Release Records To" framework designed for third-party disclosures, filling in their own name as both patient and recipient — an unintuitive experience. The form includes "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" as one of eight purpose-of-release checkboxes, but patient self-access is not called out as a distinct pathway.

However, MUSC partially compensates by offering the MyChart portal pathway, where patients can submit records requests electronically. The MyChart guide (form-2) describes a step-by-step process for requesting records within the portal, though it prominently warns about fees and a prepayment requirement. The Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool is a third option but requires webcam identity verification, adding friction.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A standard web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL at a clean, descriptive path (`muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf`). The medical records landing page links directly to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. The Spanish version was similarly accessible at a predictable URL. This is a model of straightforward form availability.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a significant shortcoming given that the form offers modern delivery options like encrypted email and MyChart. The form was clearly designed digitally (9 fonts, clean layout) but not built for digital completion.

The layout follows a logical progression: patient demographics → records source/destination → record types → purpose → date range → delivery method → legal disclosures → signature. The record-type options are well-designed, including a helpfully defined "Abstract" option. Five delivery methods are offered (mail, MyChart, fax, encrypted email, other) — above average for ROI forms. However, page 1 is dense, with legal disclosures compressed into a wall of small-print text at the bottom.

Language is a mix of plain instructions and legal/regulatory terminology. The opening warning ("FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION") is clear but intimidating. Rights disclosures reference specific CFR sections, which is appropriate but not patient-friendly.

## Barriers and Concerns

Several barriers exist. The form requires a **witness signature** — a line with no explanation of when or whether it's required, likely confusing patients into thinking it's always mandatory. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests. The form also requires attaching **a copy of patient identification** for all requests, not just representative requests — an extra step that adds friction for patients without easy copier access. The request for the **last 4 digits of SSN** is unnecessary for patient identification and may deter some patients.

The fee situation is a notable red flag. The MyChart instructional guide explicitly states that fees apply to "all patient requests released to the patient" including "search and duplication" — HIPAA only permits reasonable cost-based fees (not search fees) for patient access requests. The guide also describes a **prepayment requirement** before records are released, which may conflict with HHS/OCR guidance on patient access rights.

## Bright Spots

MUSC demonstrates genuine effort in several areas. The **Spanish-language form** (form-3) is a full professional translation preserving the complete structure and content of the English original, with bilingual headers — uncommon among organizations in this study. **Multiple pathways** (PDF, MyChart, Ciox eRequest) give patients genuine choice. **Multiple delivery methods** including encrypted email show digital awareness. The **multi-facility contact directory** on page 2 provides complete information for 9 MUSC locations, and the form explicitly references **45 CFR §164.524** (right to inspect/copy), making HIPAA rights visible to patients.

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health earns a **B grade** overall. The organization makes forms easy to find, offers multiple request pathways and delivery options, provides a Spanish-language version, and includes patient rights language. However, the generic third-party authorization form is not designed around patient self-access, the PDF lacks fillable fields despite digital distribution, and the fee/prepayment language raises compliance concerns. The witness signature and blanket ID requirements add unnecessary barriers. A dedicated patient access form with fillable fields and clearer fee disclosures would meaningfully improve the patient experience.

# Synthesis: Duly Health and Care

## Overview

Duly Health and Care (Downers Grove, IL) is a large independent, for-profit physician practice formerly known as DuPage Medical Group. Four PDF documents were retrieved: one Duly-branded ROI authorization (form-1), two MediCopy vendor authorization forms (forms 2 and 4), and one specialized FMLA/disability intake form (form-3). The primary form for patient self-access is **form-1**, Duly's own "Authorization for Release of Health Information," processed by ScanSTAT Technologies and last updated June 2023.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Duly does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. All four forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any disclosure purpose. Form-1's "Purpose of Disclosure" section includes a "Personal Reasons" checkbox, and forms 2 and 4 offer "Personal Use," but none of these forms are specifically designed around the patient's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. The same witness requirements, fee language, and expiration terms apply regardless of whether the patient is requesting records for themselves or authorizing release to a third party.

The form header does note that records "may be available through MyDMGHealth" (the MyChart patient portal), suggesting a digital self-service alternative exists — but this is a brief aside, not a developed pathway. Delivery methods on form-1 include fax, mail, MyChart, secure e-delivery, and pick-up, which is above-average flexibility. Submission of the completed form can be done via fax (630-873-8797) or email (mrrequests@dupagemd.com), so a patient can submit without visiting the facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Duly's forms was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned direct PDF links on the first attempt. Duly hosts forms on Azure blob storage, and a dedicated medical records request page exists at `dulyhealthandcare.com/services/medical-records-requests`. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor friction: the coexistence of Duly-branded and MediCopy-branded forms could confuse a patient about which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF with a text layer and clean extraction, but **zero fillable fields**. It is a print-and-fill document. Despite being "Updated 062023," the form retains legacy branding — the email uses `@dupagemd.com`, the MyChart URL references `dupagemedicalgroup.com`, and the form ID starts with "DMG." The layout is organized into six clearly numbered sections with a logical flow (patient info → records requested → recipient → delivery → purpose → signature). Record-type checkboxes are granular (11 categories including imaging CDs), and date format examples are provided — helpful details many forms lack. However, the legal text in Section 6 is dense, presented as a continuous block in small type.

The MediCopy forms (2 and 4) use friendlier conversational headings ("Tell us about the patient," "Where are we sending the records?") but also lack fillable fields and have their own issues: form-2 has no submission contact information at all, while form-4 adds a witness requirement.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-1 requires a witness signature unless the request is for continuation/transfer of care or records go directly to the patient. A patient requesting records for "Personal Reasons" must find a witness — an unusual burden with no HIPAA basis. Form-4 imposes the same requirement.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "Charges may apply. Please contact us for details. Cash payments are not accepted." No fee schedule is provided, no amounts are indicated, and there is no acknowledgment that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests. The cash-payment prohibition is unexplained.

**"All records" rejection**: Form-1 explicitly states that "'All records' or incomplete dates are not considered specific." This may improperly limit patient access under HIPAA, which permits patients to request their entire designated record set.

**No notarization** is required — a positive. **Response time** is not stated.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple delivery methods** including MyChart, secure e-delivery, fax, mail, and pick-up — five options on form-1.
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** with 11 categories give patients specific control.
- **Explicit date format examples** reduce ambiguity.
- **Patient rights statements** in form-1's Section 6 cover revocation, right to inspect, right to refuse, and re-disclosure — comprehensive if dense.
- **Easy retrieval** — forms found quickly with no technical barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Duly Health and Care provides a functional but undifferentiated records request process. The primary form is well-organized and offers good delivery flexibility, but it funnels all requests — patient self-access and third-party releases alike — through a single generic authorization with unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, fee opacity, rejection of blanket record requests). The form is not fillable, retains outdated branding, and does not acknowledge the distinction between patient access rights and third-party authorization. A patient can complete the process (print, fill, fax), but the experience is not designed around their needs as a rights-holder under HIPAA.
