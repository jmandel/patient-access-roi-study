# Best Practices — Batch 1 Findings

## Standout Organizations

### Flowers Hospital (Dothan, AL) — The Gold Standard for Patient Self-Access
This 235-bed for-profit community hospital earned the batch's only A grade (4.40). Its form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" — not "Authorization for Release" — and lists **"Myself"** as the first recipient option, before "Personal Representative" or "Other Third Party." The 66-field fillable PDF was built in Adobe InDesign with every checkbox and text input interactive. A removable media delivery option includes a password-protection toggle — an unusually thoughtful security feature. The co-equal Spanish translation (HIM-1406S) and a Swellbox online portal round out a genuinely patient-centered experience. For a mid-size for-profit hospital in rural Alabama, this level of design investment is remarkable.

### Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) — Separate Forms Done Right
Intermountain Health publishes two distinct forms: one explicitly for patients ("Patient Request for Health Information") and one for third-party release. The patient form uses question-based section headings — *"What records do you want?"*, *"How do you want your records delivered?"* — that make bureaucratic paperwork feel conversational. Its 48 fillable fields on a single page, with email submission accepted, create a genuinely digital-first pathway. This matters because patients don't have to figure out how to shoehorn their self-request into a form designed for lawyers and insurers.

### Labette Health (Parsons, KS) — Digital-First from a Small Independent Hospital
This independent nonprofit community hospital in rural Kansas offers a fully digital Formstack workflow with electronic signature, photo ID upload, and email delivery — no printing or mailing required. The form earned the batch's highest overall score (4.25/B). A "Patient/Self" option explicitly accommodates self-access. For an independent community hospital, achieving a technical accessibility score of 5 is exceptional. The only blemish: a typo in the Formstack subdomain URL ("labetteheatlh").

### Providence Sacred Heart (Spokane, WA) — Enterprise-Scale Patient Centeredness
Providence publishes a dedicated **"Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set"** — using correct HIPAA terminology — separate from its third-party authorization. The centralized portal offers per-facility pages with Spanish translations, five delivery formats (MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, Fax), and even offers to fax the form to other Providence facilities on the patient's behalf. The multi-facility coordination language — "we would be glad to fax a copy of this form to other facilities" — shows genuine systemic thinking about reducing patient burden.

### Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin — The Quiet Overachiever
This independent nonprofit practice in Madison publishes a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information Form" with 49 fillable fields, encrypted email as the default delivery method, and a stated 5-business-day processing time — well under HIPAA's 30 days. The form's question-based headers (*"What records do you want?"*) and concise single-page design make it one of the most approachable in the batch. The privacy-by-design choice of defaulting to encrypted email with an opt-in for unencrypted delivery is a detail other organizations should copy.

### A.O. Fox Hospital / Bassett Healthcare (Oneonta, NY) — Technical Excellence
The Bassett network's form packs **83 fillable fields** into two pages and defaults delivery to the MyBassett patient portal — a progressive "portal-first" design choice that nudges patients toward the fastest fulfillment channel. Seven delivery format options include encrypted email with explicit risk acknowledgment, and the opt-out model for sensitive records defaults toward completeness rather than requiring patients to opt in category by category.

### UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital — Fee Transparency Leader
UCHealth stands out for explicitly stating that patient self-access is **free** via portal and free for paper up to 100 pages — a rare concrete fee commitment. The form includes a post-Dobbs reproductive healthcare warning alerting patients to litigation risks, demonstrating real-time responsiveness to the legal environment. The "Visit Record vs. Visit Summary" definitions help patients understand what they're actually requesting.

## Patterns Across This Batch

**Dedicated patient access forms correlate with quality.** Organizations that maintain a separate form for patient self-access (Flowers, Intermountain, Providence, GHC-SCW, Erlanger, West Tennessee, Aurora Grafton) consistently scored B or above. Those relying solely on generic third-party authorization forms clustered around C grades regardless of other strengths.

**FQHCs and small hospitals punch above their weight on digital access.** Labette Health (Formstack), CrescentCare (online portal + bilingual forms), and Gritman Medical Center (63 fillable fields, email delivery) demonstrate that budget constraints don't prevent good design. Conversely, several large system-affiliated hospitals scored worse than independent critical access hospitals.

**Bilingual forms are more common than expected** — roughly a third of organizations in this batch offer Spanish-language versions — but quality varies. The best (Flowers, CrescentCare) provide identical structure and field counts; the worst leave footers and contact blocks in English, undermining the translation effort.

**The biggest gap is between form design and submission workflow.** Many organizations invest in fillable PDFs but still require printing for a wet signature, then faxing or mailing. The fully digital end-to-end pathway (Labette's Formstack, Swellbox portals) remains the exception rather than the rule.
