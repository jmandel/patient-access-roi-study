You are analyzing ROI form retrieval results for a study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city, bed_count). Use this to contextualize your findings by org type.

Your task: identify organizations in this batch whose forms or request processes stand
out positively. Look for genuinely thoughtful or innovative approaches — not just "adequate"
but things other organizations should emulate.

Write your findings to "output.md". For each notable example:
- Name the organization and describe what impressed you
- Quote specific form text or cite specific features from the synthesis
- Explain why this matters for patients

End with a brief summary of patterns you noticed across this batch.
Keep to 500-1000 words.

# Intermountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) is a community hospital within the Intermountain Health system (formerly Intermountain Healthcare), a major nonprofit health system operating across Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming. The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones — all three retrieved documents are branded and published by Intermountain Health at the enterprise level.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all hosted on Intermountain Health's website:

1. **Form 1** (legacy, 2017): "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — a general-purpose third-party release form. Non-fillable, branded under the old "Intermountain Healthcare" name. Effectively superseded but still accessible online.
2. **Form 2** (06/2025): "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — a fillable third-party disclosure form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug explicitly reads `request-records-be-sent-to-someone-else`.
3. **Form 3** (06/2025): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a fillable patient self-access form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug reads `request-records-for-yourself`.

The most relevant form for a patient requesting their own records is **form 3**, which is the primary basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Intermountain Health stands out for explicitly separating patient self-access from third-party release into **two distinct forms**. Form 3 is titled "Patient Request for Health Information," uses question-based section headings ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?"), and defaults to "Self" as the first delivery recipient option. This is meaningfully different from the common pattern of funneling all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form. The footer acknowledges the patient's right of access under HIPAA.

One blemish: Form 2 (the third-party form) confusingly includes a "Patient Access Information" section with bullets about supervised in-person review and photo ID requirements, blurring the line between the two forms. However, the existence of a separate, cleaner patient-access form mitigates this.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF download links with no login, portal, or JavaScript rendering required. No bot blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on two domains — the legacy `intermountainhealthcare.org` and the current `prod.intermountainhealth.org` — which creates minor confusion but did not impede retrieval. The URL paths are descriptive and logical.

## Form Document Quality (Form 3)

Form 3 is a single-page, fully fillable PDF with 48 interactive fields, Print/Clear buttons, and a clean numbered 7-section layout. The language is plain and direct — section headings are phrased as questions, and the instruction "Please fill out all sections to avoid delay" is practical. Record types are covered by 12 checkboxes spanning clinical, imaging, billing, and substance use categories. Delivery options include paper mail, in-person pickup, and electronic (email, USB, CD, portal, other) with a free-text specification field. At ~2,030 characters of text, the form is admirably concise with no dense legal boilerplate.

Submission methods include email, fax, and mail — organized by state (UT/ID routes to Murray, CO/NV/MT/WY routes to Broomfield). Email submission is a genuine accessibility feature enabling fully digital completion and submission.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. Multiple remote submission options (email, fax, mail) are available — no in-person-only restriction. Fee language is vague: "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records" without specifying amounts, which could deter patients. The UT/ID email routes to R1 RCM (`MedRecReq@r1rcm.com`), a third-party vendor, without explanation on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-access form** separate from third-party authorization — uncommon and patient-centered
- **48 fillable fields** on a single page with Print/Clear buttons — excellent digital-first design
- **Question-based section headings** make the form feel conversational rather than bureaucratic
- **Email submission accepted** — a fully digital pathway from completion to submission
- **Electronic delivery explicitly offered** including email, USB, CD, portal, and "other"
- **Multilingual interpretation notices** on the legacy form (Chinese Traditional and Spanish)

## Overall Assessment

Intermountain Health provides one of the stronger patient access experiences in this study. The deliberate separation of patient self-access from third-party release, combined with a well-designed fillable form and multiple electronic submission channels, demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness. The form's plain language, logical structure, and concise single-page format make it accessible without assistance. Minor weaknesses — vague fee disclosure, undisclosed vendor routing, and a confusing legacy form still online — prevent a top-tier score but do not materially impede patient access.

# U.S. Dermatology Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides a single ROI form — "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — available as a one-page PDF from their Patient Forms page. Two copies were found online: form-1.pdf (uploaded March 2020, currently linked) and form-2.pdf (uploaded June 2019, orphaned but still publicly accessible). Both contain identical text, with a revision footer of "Rev 08/2017," indicating the content has not been substantively updated in nearly nine years. For patient self-access purposes, form-1.pdf is the relevant document.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Instead, it uses a generic HIPAA authorization form that bundles patient self-access with third-party release scenarios. "Patient Access" appears as one checkbox among five under "Purpose of Use/Disclosure," alongside "To Doctor," "To Insurance," "To Attorney," and "Other." The overall framing — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure" — is oriented toward third-party release, and a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form structure designed for a different purpose. For example, the recipient section asks for "Name of individual or organization" and its address, which is confusing when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" surfaced the PDF directly, and the Patient Forms page at `usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/` has a clearly labeled "Medical Records Release" link. No bot blocking, login wall, or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields** (`fillable_field_count: 0`), requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and physically sign. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow with clear sections for patient identification, disclosure direction, delivery method, purpose, date range, record types, and rights disclosures. Language is somewhat legalistic but generally readable. The form lacks instructions on where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is provided.

## Delivery and Submission

The form lists three delivery options for records: mailed, faxed, or electronic (patient portal only). However, these describe how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself is *submitted*. The form is silent on submission method, leaving patients without guidance. Given the lack of submission instructions and the non-fillable PDF, the workflow is effectively: download → print → hand-fill → unknown submission. The patient forms page and general website would likely require calling the office to determine where to send it; fax is presumably available once the patient contacts the office.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions**: The most significant usability gap. A patient who completes the form has no idea where to send it.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure," bundled into the authorization with no opt-out. This is overreaching for patient self-access requests.
- **Vague fee language**: "A reasonable fee may be charged for the records" does not distinguish patient-access requests (HIPAA-limited) from third-party releases, and gives no indication of actual costs.
- **Typo**: "IDS" instead of "AIDS" in the sensitive information disclosure — uncorrected since 2017.
- **No response time commitment**: No mention of turnaround time or the 30-day HIPAA requirement.
- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive fields despite being a digitally created PDF.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: The entire authorization fits on one page without being cramped — a respectful use of patient time.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment" is unambiguous and well-placed.
- **Easy online findability**: Directly linked from a well-organized Patient Forms page with clear labeling.
- **Patient rights disclosures**: Five bullet points covering right to a copy, right to inspect, right to revoke, voluntariness, and sensitive information notice.

## Overall Assessment

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides an easily findable, concise ROI form that technically accommodates patient self-access through a checkbox — but the form is fundamentally a third-party authorization repurposed for all disclosure scenarios. The lack of fillable fields, missing submission instructions, bundled liability waiver, and vague fee language collectively create a paper-era experience with notable friction points. The form has not been meaningfully updated since 2017. A patient can likely get their records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# GI Alliance — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

GI Alliance is a large, for-profit physician practice management organization headquartered in Southlake, TX, operating dozens of affiliated gastroenterology practices nationwide. Three forms were retrieved: one text-based authorization form from the main gialliance.com website (form-1), and two image-only scanned forms from affiliate practices Granite Peaks GI (form-2) and University GI (form-3). Form-1 is the canonical, centrally published document and represents the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Dedicated Patient Route

GI Alliance does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information," while forms 2 and 3 are explicitly titled "Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party." None reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or acknowledge the distinct legal framework for patient self-access versus third-party authorization (§ 164.508).

Form-1 does include a "at Patient's request" checkbox under the purpose section, making it technically usable for patient-directed requests, but the form structure — requiring a recipient address, lacking delivery format preferences, and using authorization language throughout — treats the patient as just another requester rather than an individual exercising a legal right. This conflation could cause the organization to inadvertently apply third-party authorization rules (higher fees, broader denial grounds) to patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the primary form was relatively straightforward. A site-specific web search surfaced form-1 directly at a WordPress uploads URL. GI Alliance maintains a patient forms page at `gialliance.com/patient-forms-and-prep/`, but it is organized by local brand/location, adding navigational complexity for patients who must first identify their affiliate practice. The affiliate forms (forms 2 and 3) required searching beyond the main domain. No login wall, bot blocking, or portal gating was encountered. Retrieval difficulty: easy for the main form, moderate for the affiliate variants.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available document, is a single-page text-based PDF authored digitally in Microsoft Word — a significant quality advantage over the affiliate scans. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are rendered as underscores, requiring the patient to print and handwrite. There is no electronic signature capability and no submit button. The form must be printed, completed by hand, and returned — but critically, **no submission method is specified anywhere on the form** (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link). A patient who downloads this form has no way to know where to send it without calling the organization.

The layout is logical, following standard authorization flow: patient identification → recipient → scope → sensitive categories → purpose → duration/revocation → signature. However, there are no bold section headers, no instructional text, and the language is moderately legalistic (e.g., "d/b/a GI Alliance on behalf of itself and all other practices that are operating as a single HIPAA Affiliated Covered Entity"). The form is concise at one page, which is a positive.

The affiliate forms (2 and 3) are substantially worse in quality: form-2 is a browser print-to-PDF with a completely garbled text layer (broken Type 3 font encoding), and form-3 is a raw scan with no text layer at all. Both are inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally. Form-3 appears to be truncated, missing required HIPAA authorization elements like the signature block and revocation instructions.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blank provider identity**: Form-1 leaves both the authorizing entity name and the revocation mailing address as blank fill-ins, creating a functional barrier for patients who don't know which affiliate practice to name.
- **No submission instructions**: None of the three forms specify where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees or the patient's right to cost-based pricing under HIPAA.
- **No processing timeline**: No indication of how long records fulfillment will take.
- **SSN collection**: Forms 2 and 3 request the last four digits of SSN — unnecessary for HIPAA record requests and a potential deterrent.
- **No delivery format options**: Form-1 does not ask how the patient wants to receive records; forms 2 and 3 offer only "E-Delivery" and "Mail."

## Bright Spots

- **Sensitive information categories**: Form-1 requires separate initials for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance use, and genetic information — a compliance-conscious design respecting state-level protections.
- **Explicit non-conditioning statement**: The clear declaration that treatment/payment won't be conditioned on signing is present and well-stated.
- **Concise format**: Form-1 covers all essential elements on a single page without being excessively dense.
- **Granular record selection** (affiliate forms): Forms 2 and 3 offer 9-10 specific record-type checkboxes, giving patients meaningful control over what information is released.

## Overall Assessment

GI Alliance provides a minimally adequate but patient-unfriendly records request experience. The organization channels all access requests — whether from patients, insurers, or attorneys — through a single generic authorization framework with no acknowledgment that patient self-access is a distinct right with its own legal protections. The primary form is digitally authored but not fillable, includes no submission instructions, and leaves critical fields (provider name, revocation address) blank. A patient attempting to request their own records online would download a form they cannot fill digitally, would not know where to send it, and would receive no guidance about fees, timelines, or their rights. The experience reflects organizational indifference to patient self-service rather than intentional obstruction.

# Medical City Dallas Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Medical City Dallas Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare's Medical City Healthcare division, provides patients with a single system-wide authorization form for requesting health records. The form is available in both English and Spanish as fillable PDFs linked from the hospital's medical records webpage. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients requesting their own records use the same generic HIPAA authorization form designed for all release-of-information scenarios, including third-party disclosures.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were retrieved, both hosted on HCA's digital asset management platform (`hcadam.com`):

- **Form 1** (English): HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21 — "Authorization for Release of PHI (Protected Health Information)." A 1-page fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields.
- **Form 2** (Spanish): HCA-840-00434-S — Direct Spanish translation of Form 1, with identical structure and 52 fillable fields.

Both forms are general-purpose release authorizations. The purpose-of-disclosure field offers "At the request of the individual" as one option alongside "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form does not distinguish between patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) and third-party authorization. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission wizard.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required navigating the hospital website to the medical records page (`/locations/medical-city-dallas-hospital/for-patients/medical-records`). Direct web searches returned stale 404 URLs from a previous hosting location (`medicalcityhealthcare.com/util/forms/`), with no redirects in place. Once on the correct page, the forms are clearly labeled and directly downloadable. No bot blocking or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed, born-digital PDF — not a scan. All 52 fields are interactive and fillable on-screen, eliminating the need for handwriting. The single-page format is efficient but extremely dense: patient demographics, recipient information, four delivery options (paper, electronic media, encrypted email, unencrypted email), 16+ record-type checkboxes, a six-point disclosure statement, psychotherapy notes handling, marketing/sale of PHI questions, and a signature block are all compressed into one page. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — functional for most adults but potentially challenging for low-literacy readers.

The form provides clear section headers (A, B, C) and logically groups related fields. Instructions are implicit in the form structure rather than stated separately. The consent statements correctly cover voluntary authorization, revocation rights, and non-conditioning of treatment — standard HIPAA requirements. The form mentions a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying an amount.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked "(optional)." While optional, collecting SSN on an ROI form is unnecessary for patient identification and creates a data exposure risk.
- **Centralized processing**: All requests go to HCA headquarters in Nashville (PO Box 290789), not to the local hospital. A patient expecting to deal with Medical City Dallas directly may find this confusing.
- **Fax restriction**: Fax delivery is limited to "Physician Office / Medical facility," which could restrict a patient's ability to receive records via fax at a non-medical location.
- **No online submission**: The form must be printed, signed, and mailed or faxed to Nashville. There is no portal-based or email submission option. However, fax submission is available (844-481-0298), meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language version**: A fully translated Spanish form with identical structure and fillable fields, linked with Spanish-language text from the same page — a meaningful accessibility feature for Dallas's large Spanish-speaking population.
- **USCDI release option**: The form includes a forward-looking option for USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release requests, acknowledging modern health data exchange standards. This is rare among ROI forms.
- **52 fillable fields**: Comprehensive digital interactivity means the entire form can be completed on-screen before printing for signature.
- **Four delivery format options**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients genuine choice.

## Overall Assessment

Medical City Dallas Hospital, via its parent HCA Healthcare, provides a technically competent ROI form that is fillable, multilingual, and reasonably well-organized. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — there is no dedicated patient access pathway. The form is a generic authorization that serves all purposes. Findability is hampered by broken legacy URLs, and the centralized Nashville processing model may confuse local patients. The form's document quality is solid (fillable, clear sections, multiple delivery options), but the lack of a patient-centric access pathway and the optional SSN field are notable shortcomings. The organization earns a mid-range assessment: technically adequate with meaningful strengths in multilingual access and digital form quality, but falling short on patient-centeredness and access pathway design.

# Fenway Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fenway Health, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Boston, MA, provides a cohesive three-document records-release package: an English ROI authorization form (form-1), a companion FAQ guide (form-2), and a Spanish translation of the ROI form (form-3). The forms are easy to find, submission channels are plentiful, and the organization demonstrates genuine care for its patient population through thoughtful design choices — but it does not offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway, instead routing all records requests through a generic third-party authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

The primary form is titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" and is structured around a FROM/TO model: "I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM: Sender/Facility's name... TO: Recipient/Facility's name." This framing is designed for provider-to-provider transfers — a patient wanting their own records must write their personal name and address into the "Recipient/Facility's name" field, which is unintuitive. There is no checkbox for "send records to me" and no separate patient access form. The organization does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization.

Fenway Health also offers MyChart patient portal access, which provides a separate digital pathway, but the downloadable form itself is firmly a generic authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Fenway Health's forms was straightforward — a simple web search immediately returned the PDF URL and the dedicated medical records page at fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was needed. The organization maintains a clean, dedicated medical records landing page with clear submission instructions. This is a best-case retrieval scenario.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a clean text layer and 7 fonts — clearly designed with care in a layout tool. However, it contains zero fillable fields, which is a significant missed opportunity. Despite being digitally created, patients must print, hand-fill, and then scan or fax the form. The layout follows a logical 7-section flow (patient info → sender → recipient → reason → record type → sensitive info → signature) and fits on one page, though the density is notable. The legal notice in Section 7 is a single 130-word block mixing authorization scope, revocation rights, reproductive health protections, and substance abuse protections — challenging to parse.

Section 6 (Sensitive Information) stands out: it requires individual patient initials for 10 categories of sensitive health information, including abortion care, gender-affirming care, HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, and substance use treatment. This granularity gives patients unusually fine-grained control over disclosure.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fenway Health imposes no unreasonable barriers. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person mandate, and no fees mentioned. Submission channels include mail, fax, email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org), and MyChart portal — four pathways, all adequate for remote submission. The form clearly states revocation rights and a one-year authorization validity period. Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (in the FAQ sheet), well within HIPAA's 30-day requirement. The sensitive information initials requirement, while thorough, could function as a processing delay trigger if patients skip it — the bold warning "COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING" has a somewhat coercive tone.

## Notable Strengths

Fenway Health's standout feature is the companion FAQ sheet (form-2) — a 3-page plain-language guide that walks patients through every section of the ROI form, defining terms like "bi-directional" and "abstract" that would otherwise be opaque. Very few healthcare organizations create separate instructional documents for their ROI forms. The Spanish-language form (form-3) demonstrates commitment to language access, though no Spanish FAQ exists. The inclusion of Massachusetts-specific shield-law language protecting reproductive health and gender-affirming care records reflects both legal compliance and organizational mission. The "Name used (if different)" field thoughtfully accommodates patients whose current name differs from their legal name.

## Weaknesses

The most significant weakness is the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway. The FROM/TO structure is designed for third-party release and does not clearly serve a patient requesting their own records. The lack of fillable fields on a born-digital PDF is a technical oversight that forces an unnecessary print-handwrite-scan workflow. The Spanish form's contact block reverts to English ("Mail/Fax to:", "Attn: Medical Records Dept"), undermining the translation effort.

## Overall Assessment

Fenway Health earns a solid B. The organization demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its FAQ guide, multilingual forms, and sensitive information protections, but falls short on the two key assessment dimensions: it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, and its form is not digitally fillable despite being born-digital. A patient can successfully request their records through this process, but the form was not designed with that use case as a first-class concern.

# Erlanger Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga, TN provides three distinct ROI-related documents: a general system-wide "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form-1), a behavioral health–specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" (form-3). The existence of form-3 — a purpose-built patient access request form — is the key differentiator for this organization and the focus of this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Erlanger is one of the organizations that clearly distinguishes between a patient exercising their right of access and a third-party release authorization. Form-3 is titled "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" and opens with the option to "give me a copy of my health information" — framing the interaction as a patient right rather than an authorization for disclosure. This is structurally separate from form-1, which serves as the general-purpose ROI authorization covering any release direction (to self, third party, insurer, attorney, etc.). The existence of this dedicated pathway shows deliberate organizational awareness that patient access and third-party release are different use cases with different legal frameworks.

However, the dedicated form originates from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital (EWCH) and it is unclear from the form itself whether it applies system-wide. The general ROI form (form-1) does include a "_________myself" option in the "Release Information To" field, providing an alternate pathway through the broader form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. All three were surfaced through a single web search, with no login walls, bot blocking, or broken links. The main erlanger.org site hosts a Medical Records page under patient tools. Form-3's URL is under a "murphy" path that may be associated with a specific facility building, making it less discoverable via direct site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the primary patient access form, is a single-page, digitally authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The layout is clean and logical, flowing from patient identification through facility selection, date range, record type checkboxes, format preference, delivery method, and signature. The language is notably plain and patient-friendly, using first-person phrasing: "I would like," "I want these parts of my record." The form provides granular record selection with 18 options across hospital and office/clinic categories, giving patients meaningful control over scope.

Form-1 (the general ROI) is also digitally authored with a text layer but no fillable fields (2 pages, 14+ record type options). Form-2 (behavioral health) is an image-only scan — inaccessible to screen readers and impossible to fill electronically.

## Submission Methods

Form-3 does not clearly state how to submit the completed form. An "EWCH Use Only" section with "ID Verified" checkboxes implies in-person submission may be expected. However, the broader Erlanger system accepts fax submissions — form-2's instruction page provides a fax number for the HIM department, and form-1 includes fax as a contact/delivery option. Mail is also available. No online portal or email submission option exists for the forms themselves, though secure email is offered as a records *delivery* method.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness requirements exist. The primary patient access form (form-3) is completely silent on fees — patients have no idea if they will be charged. Form-1 mentions "charges may apply" for CD and paper copies but does not specify amounts. Form-3 notes a 30-day turnaround, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Both form-1 and form-3 request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary when combined with name, DOB, and medical record number. Form-1 bundles sensitive-category consent (substance abuse, HIV, mental health) with no opt-out mechanism, which may raise 42 CFR Part 2 concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release — a meaningful structural choice
- **Plain-language, first-person framing** that is unusually patient-friendly
- **Granular record type selection** (18 options across hospital and clinic settings)
- **Secure email as a delivery option** for receiving records
- **Single-page simplicity** for the patient access form

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any form — all require print-and-handwrite workflow
- **No fee disclosure** on the patient access form
- **Unclear submission process** for form-3 (implies in-person with ID verification)
- **No patient rights statement** on the dedicated access form
- **Behavioral health form (form-2)** is an image-only scan with production errors (placeholder text left in)

## Overall Assessment

Erlanger demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form with plain language and granular record selection. The organizational awareness that patient access differs from third-party release is commendable. However, the complete absence of fillable fields, unclear submission instructions, and lack of fee transparency prevent the experience from being truly streamlined. The overall pathway earns a **B** — solid design intent held back by technical and process execution gaps.

# Tioga Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Tioga Medical Center, a small independent critical access hospital in Tioga, North Dakota, offers a single ROI form: an "Authorization for Release of Medical/Confidential Information" available from its Health Information Management (HIM) page at https://www.tiogahealth.org/him. The form is provided in both PDF and Word (.docx) formats. No patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form exists. The only submission options apparent from the form are fax (701-664-2646) and mail (P.O. Box 159, Tioga, ND 58852).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Tioga Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form uses a "Release From" / "Release To" structure that assumes records are moving between facilities or to a third party — not to the patient themselves. A patient requesting their own records would need to awkwardly list themselves in the "Release To" field, navigating a paradigm that was never designed for them. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no dedicated patient access pathway, and no guidance on how patients requesting their own records should complete the form. This is a textbook example of the "wrong form" problem: the organization funnels all requesters through a generic authorization form built for inter-institutional disclosure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the HIM page, and the form is directly linked with no login required. For a small critical access hospital, this represents reasonable discoverability. The only minor issue is that the download URL is a Wix-generated hash path that gives no indication of the document's content, and the HIM page provides little context about when or why a patient would use this form.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is an **image-only scan** — a CCITT fax-encoded grayscale image at 200 DPI with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers and fails basic digital accessibility standards. A patient must print the form and fill it out by hand. The availability of a Word (.docx) version partially mitigates this: a patient with Microsoft Word could type into the document, but this depends on having compatible software and the initiative to seek out the alternative format.

The form itself is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, release-from/to facility information, date range, purpose checkboxes (6 options), record type checkboxes (12 categories), sensitive records authorization, and signature lines. The 12 checkbox categories for record types — from emergency room records to clinic notes — provide genuinely useful granularity. However, a dense legal paragraph at the bottom covers revocation rights, insurance implications, and re-disclosure warnings in a single unbroken block with no visual emphasis on key patient rights.

## Barriers and Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — while not explicitly marked as required, its presence as a structured field implies it is expected. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests, and this could deter patients who lack someone available to witness. The form mentions no fees, states no response timeline, and provides no delivery format options (electronic, CD, mail). An internal tracking sidebar ("Records given □ / Number of Pages / Initials") sits unlabeled among patient-facing fields, creating potential confusion.

## Strengths

Despite its limitations, the form has some positive elements: a clear voluntariness statement ("I can refuse to sign this authorization. I need not sign this form in order to assure treatment"), explicit revocation rights, a reasonable six-month authorization window, and granular record-type selection. The dual-format availability (PDF + Word) shows some awareness of accessibility needs, even if the execution is lacking.

## Overall Assessment

Tioga Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request process that reflects the resource constraints typical of small independent critical access hospitals. The form is easy to find and covers the basics, but it is technically primitive (image-only scan), not designed for patient self-access, and includes a potentially unnecessary witness requirement. A patient could navigate this process, but they would need to print the form, handwrite their information, figure out that they belong in the "Release To" field, and fax or mail it back. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate findability cannot fully compensate for poor technical accessibility and a form paradigm that treats patient self-access as an afterthought.

# Lankenau Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lankenau Medical Center is part of **Main Line Health**, a regional nonprofit health system in suburban Philadelphia. The facility does not publish its own records request form; instead, it uses a system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form managed centrally by Main Line Health. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URLs on mainlinehealth.org — form-1.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0621, June 2021) with 41 fillable fields and interactive buttons, and form-2.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0325, March 2025) as a flat, non-interactive PDF with zero fillable fields. Both are 2-page documents with identical content structure.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed to serve all disclosure purposes — release to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. That said, Main Line Health does include **"Patient personal use"** as an explicit purpose checkbox, which is a positive accommodation. However, the form's framing remains disclosure-oriented: it asks the patient to specify "This information is to be disclosed to: Name of Person or Institution," meaning a patient requesting their own records must somewhat awkwardly write their own name as the disclosure recipient. There is no separate, streamlined pathway for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A straightforward web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No bot blocking, authentication, or patient portal login was required. The form is prominently published on the Main Line Health website. The only minor friction is that two versions coexist at different URLs without any clear indication of which is current — a patient could inadvertently download the older fillable version or the newer flat version.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing based on **form-1.pdf** (the fillable version, which provides the better patient experience):

- **Fillable fields**: Yes — 41 interactive fields plus PRINT, SAVE AS, EMAIL, and RESET action buttons. The EMAIL button suggests the form can be completed and submitted entirely digitally. This is genuinely digital-first design.
- **Layout**: Clean and logically organized — facility selection → patient ID → date range → record types → sensitive information → recipient → purpose → delivery → expiration → signatures, with a full instructions page on the reverse.
- **Language**: A mix of plain and legal language. The rights acknowledgment paragraphs are substantive but dense. Instructions on page 2 are clear and well-structured.
- **Instructions**: Thorough. Numbered instructions cover completion requirements, submission methods (fax, email, mail, walk-in), a delivery options matrix by recipient type, fee information, and detailed signing authority guidance for minors, incapacitated patients, and deceased patients under PA law.
- **Delivery options**: Exceptionally strong — six options including encrypted USB, MyChart portal, printed paper (pick-up or mail), fax, and encrypted email/third-party portal. A clear table shows availability by recipient type.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Prepayment language**: The instructions state "payment will be expected prior to the records being delivered," which could function as a barrier to patient access. Under HIPAA, covered entities should not condition record delivery on prepayment in a way that creates unreasonable barriers.
- **Witness line ambiguity**: A "(Signature of Witness)" field is present but the form does not clarify whether a witness is required, potentially confusing patients completing the form at home.
- **Fee amounts undisclosed**: The form references fees "in accordance with Federal and PA State Law" but does not specify amounts, leaving patients uncertain about costs.
- **No notarization required**: Correct — the form does not impose this unnecessary barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Excellent delivery options** with encrypted electronic formats and a clear availability matrix
- **Fillable PDF** with embedded action buttons (form-1 version)
- **"Patient personal use" checkbox** that normalizes self-access requests
- **Detailed signing authority guidance** reflecting PA-specific law
- **Sensitive information opt-in** with separate checkboxes for HIV, psychiatric, and substance abuse records
- **HIPAA-compliant response timelines** clearly stated (30/60 days with 30-day extension)

## Overall Assessment

Main Line Health provides an above-average records request experience for Lankenau Medical Center patients. The form is easy to find, technically well-executed (in its fillable version), and offers unusually comprehensive delivery options. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic third-party disclosure form and adapt it to their own needs. The prepayment language and undisclosed fee amounts are minor compliance concerns. Overall, this represents a solid **B-grade** experience: a patient can accomplish their goal, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# Adena Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Adena Regional Medical Center, a nonprofit community hospital in Chillicothe, Ohio and part of the Adena Health System, provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests. The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — patients requesting their own records must navigate the same form designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. Three documents were found on the organization's medical records request page: two versions of the same ROI authorization form (one current, one outdated) and a fee schedule.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf** (CLI.1777, Rev. 10/25), a one-page "Authorization: Release of Information Form" that serves as the current version. An older version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/02/2020) is also linked from the same page under "Option 3 – By Mail or Fax," creating confusion about which form to use. The fee schedule (form-3.pdf) is a supplementary document published as an image-only scan with no text layer.

Submission is available by mail or fax. Form-2 explicitly lists the fax number (740-779-7769) and mailing address; form-1 does not include a fax number, an oversight that may force patients to hunt for contact information. No online portal submission for records requests was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Adena does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both form versions use a three-way checkbox ("Obtain records from / Release records to / Exchange verbal information with") oriented toward third-party disclosure flows. A patient requesting their own records would need to check "Release records to" and enter their own name as recipient — a non-obvious workflow. The form includes "Personal" as a purpose-of-disclosure option, which is a helpful signal, but there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or any language distinguishing patient-access requests from third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search for the medical records release form surfaced the dedicated medical records request page at `/patients-and-visitors/patient-rights/medical-records-request` on the first attempt. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. All PDFs were directly downloadable. The page is logically located under "Patient Rights," reachable in approximately three clicks from the homepage.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created, text-based PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand (or use a third-party PDF annotation tool). The form fits on a single page, which is commendable for brevity, but the layout is cramped as a result. Sections flow logically (demographics → direction → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → rights → signature), though there are no formal section headers. The record type selection is comprehensive, offering 14 options including an "Abstract" bundle. Language is moderately legalistic, particularly in the "I understand the following" rights section. An "Administrative Use Only – Driver's license number" field at the very top may confuse patients into thinking it's required.

A notable positive: the form explicitly offers electronic delivery of records via email, putting it ahead of many peers. However, no encryption or secure delivery mechanism is mentioned.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is a **witness signature requirement** — HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient authorizations, and a patient filling out the form at home would need to find a witness, potentially discouraging submission. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which is common but not required by HIPAA and raises data security concerns.

Fee language is problematic: the form states charges "WILL" apply "in accordance with Ohio Law" without distinguishing patient-access requests (subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee cap) from third-party releases (subject to potentially higher state rates). The fee schedule is published proactively on the medical records page — a positive practice — but as an image-only scan it is inaccessible to screen readers, translation tools, and text search.

The psychotherapy notes checkbox requires "approval by psychotherapist," which is appropriate for third-party release but would constitute an impermissible barrier if applied to patient self-access requests.

## Overall Assessment

Adena Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and concise, with some thoughtful features like electronic delivery and comprehensive record type options. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party-oriented design, the witness signature requirement, and ambiguous fee language collectively create a process that works for patients who are persistent but was clearly not designed with patient self-access as a priority. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate but with meaningful room for improvement in both form design and patient-centeredness.

# Duke University Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Duke Health provides four documents related to records release. The most relevant for a patient requesting their own records is **form-4.pdf** (M3132, Rev. 3/2025), the current enterprise-wide Authorization for Release of Information. This is a single-page, fillable PDF with 67 interactive fields, hosted on a well-organized medical records landing page. The companion **form-2.pdf** is a 3-page plain-language instruction sheet walking patients through each section of the authorization. Form-1 is an older revision of the same M3132 form (Rev. 4/2024) that remains accessible at a stale URL, and form-3 is an image-only scan of an even older revision posted on a satellite Duke outpatient clinic site — both are superseded and inferior to form-4.

Duke also mentions that Spanish-language versions are available on the official forms page, and the forms page links to additional documents (verbal release form, proxy access form, external records request).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Duke does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The M3132 authorization is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to serve both patient self-requests and third-party releases (attorneys, insurers, other providers). However, the form accommodates patient access reasonably well: Part B includes a "Self (Same Info As Above)" checkbox, Part D lists "Personal" as the first purpose option, and Part E prominently features "My Duke Health (Patients Only)" as a delivery method. The companion instructions explicitly address patients requesting their own records ("If you are the patient and are requesting the records be sent to you, select 'Self'"). While functional, a patient must still navigate sections designed for third-party scenarios, and the form doesn't distinguish the differing legal frameworks (Right of Access vs. Authorization) that apply to each case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy** — rated as a 2-click path from the Duke Health homepage (Medical Records → Authorization Forms). The official forms page is clearly titled, well-organized, and lists all available downloads. Web searches readily surface direct PDF URLs. The only retrieval concern is stale URLs: the older form-1 revision remains accessible via search engines, and a satellite Duke site hosts an image-only scan (form-3) that was uploaded as recently as June 2024 despite being from 2022.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the current primary form, is a strong digital-first artifact. It contains **67 fillable interactive fields** on a single page — enabling patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing. The layout follows a logical six-part structure (Patient Info → Recipient → Records to Release → Purpose → Delivery Format → Review/Approval) with clear section headers. The record-type selection offers excellent granularity: 14+ individual report categories, treatment date ranges, and facility-specific or enterprise-wide options. Sensible defaults are transparently stated ("Last 2 years of active treatment will be provided unless specified"). The language is generally clear and functional, though the legal disclosure text in Part F is dense. The companion instruction document (form-2) defines each medical record type in accessible language — an unusually thorough support resource.

## Barriers and Concerns

Duke imposes no notarization requirement; the witness section from the older revision has been removed entirely. Submission channels are robust: email, fax, and mail, with a phone number for questions. No in-person requirement exists. However, several issues merit attention:

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number — not required by HIPAA and an unnecessary privacy risk when medical record number and date of birth are also collected.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Duke Health may charge a fee" with "Charges may apply" noted for CD and paper delivery, but no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Patients must affirmatively check boxes for Mental/Behavioral Health and Genetic Testing to receive those portions of their own records — arguably a barrier for patient self-access, where HIPAA grants access to the complete designated record set. The form mentions HIV/AIDS in the text but provides no corresponding checkbox, creating ambiguity.
- **Unnamed form fields**: All 67 fillable fields lack descriptive names, creating an accessibility gap for screen reader users.

## Strengths

Duke excels in several areas: multiple electronic delivery options (MyChart patient portal, encrypted email, fax), granular record-type selection, companion instructions with plain-language medical definitions, multiple submission channels, and a clean digital-first form design. The existence of a separate instruction document with a helpline number demonstrates genuine investment in patient guidance. Electronic delivery options are listed first in Part E, signaling a preference for digital fulfillment.

## Overall Assessment

Duke University Hospital provides a well-organized, technically competent records request experience anchored by a strong fillable PDF form and excellent companion documentation. The primary limitation is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization designed for all release scenarios. The form handles patient self-requests adequately through its "Self" checkbox and "Personal" purpose option, but doesn't inform patients of their Right of Access or distinguish the simpler patient-access legal framework from third-party authorization. Minor concerns around SSN collection, vague fee disclosure, and sensitive-information opt-in prevent a top-tier rating, but overall this is an above-average experience.

# Boulder Medical Center — Organization Synthesis

## Available Pathways

Boulder Medical Center (BMC) presents patients with three record-request pathways, clearly laid out on their [Medical Records department page](https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/departments/medical-records/): (1) a Swellbox online portal for records created before September 9, 2024; (2) the MyChart "Sharing Hub" for records after that date; and (3) a downloadable PDF authorization form. The PDF form (`form-1.pdf`) was the only traditional document available for download and is the focus of this evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

BMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single PDF form — titled "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Patient Information" — is a generic ROI authorization designed to handle bidirectional record transfers between entities. While the phrase "I am requesting my records" appears, the form's structure treats the patient as a routing intermediary rather than the information recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no language explaining patient-specific rights beyond the standard no-conditioning clause. The online portals (Swellbox and MyChart) may provide a more patient-centric experience, but neither was evaluated as a downloadable form document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search led directly to the Medical Records page, where the PDF is clearly linked under "Option 2." No bot-blocking, JavaScript rendering, or deep navigation was required. The page helpfully contextualizes the PDF as one of three options, giving patients a clear choice. This is a strong findability result.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a single-page, digitally-created document — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print and handwrite. The layout follows a logical flow (demographics → delivery method → record types → entity information → authorization → signatures), but the authorization section is a dense block of nine "I understand" statements with no visual separation. The form includes some genuinely helpful plain-language disclosures ("once this information is disclosed by BMC, it will no longer be protected by BMC"), though the dual-direction design ("from the Entity... to be mailed to ___ at BMC" vs. "to be sent to Entity listed below") is confusing for a patient requesting their own records for personal use. Record type options are limited to five categories with no "all records" checkbox.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form states a 10-business-day processing time, well within HIPAA's 30-day window. It correctly includes a no-conditioning clause and a 180-day expiration. However, the fee disclosure is vague ("there may be a cost to copy the records") with no schedule or estimate. Most concerning is the email restriction: "Due to HIPAA regulations regarding security of electronic transmissions, we cannot email records to anyone but your personal email." This mischaracterizes HIPAA, which explicitly grants patients the right to direct records to a third party. The designated agent language is also narrowly scoped, covering only incapacitated patients rather than parents of minors or POA holders. Submission can be done by fax (303-449-9380) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple pathways**: The website clearly presents three options (Swellbox, MyChart, PDF), giving patients choices based on their record dates and preferences.
- **Single-page conciseness**: The form avoids the multi-page burden common at other organizations.
- **Plain-language disclosures**: Several authorization statements are unusually clear and honest.
- **Easy findability**: The form is prominently linked from a well-organized Medical Records page.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** despite being a digitally-created PDF — a missed opportunity.
- **No patient access differentiation**: The form treats all requests identically regardless of who is requesting and why.
- **Misleading HIPAA email restriction**: Incorrectly frames a policy choice as a legal requirement.
- **Stale form**: Revision date January 2019, uploaded November 2020, but a major system transition occurred in September 2024.

## Overall Assessment

Boulder Medical Center earns credit for making its form easy to find and for offering multiple request pathways including online portals. However, the PDF form itself is a generic, non-fillable ROI authorization that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The misleading email restriction and vague fee disclosure are compliance concerns. A patient can complete the process via fax or mail submission without visiting in person, which meets the baseline, but the lack of fillable fields and the form's dual-direction confusion reduce usability. The organization is adequate but not patient-centered in its PDF-based pathway.

# A.O. Fox Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

A.O. Fox Hospital is a community hospital in Oneonta, NY, part of the Bassett Healthcare Network. It does not maintain its own medical records request form; instead, patients are directed to a single, network-wide "Authorization for Medical Record Release" (form H-6653) shared across all five Bassett facilities. This is the sole form available and serves as the primary pathway for any patient — whether requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Access Pathway

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of medical record release, not a dedicated patient access request form. However, it does meaningfully accommodate patient self-access: Section 2 includes a "Self, address listed above" checkbox, Section 7 offers "Patient Request" as a purpose option, and Section 4 defaults to electronic delivery via the MyBassett Portal when no format is specified. These features ensure a patient can navigate the form for self-access without excessive confusion, but the form's framing as an "Authorization for Medical Record Release" — rooted in 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization concepts rather than § 164.524 Right of Access — means patients are signing an authorization they don't technically need, and must navigate sections (verbal communication authorization, expiration dates, redisclosure warnings) that are largely irrelevant to self-access.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the pathway level. There is no separate patient access form, no distinct web page for individual record requests, and no portal-based request wizard. The single PDF form serves all purposes.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**, though not via A.O. Fox Hospital directly. A search for Fox-specific forms returned nothing; searching for the parent system — Bassett Healthcare Network — immediately surfaced a direct PDF link on bassett.org. A patient who knows Fox is part of Bassett would locate this quickly. One who searches only for "A.O. Fox Hospital medical records" might need an extra step. No bot blocking, broken links, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-constructed, digital-first fillable PDF** — one of the strongest technical implementations in the study. Key characteristics:

- **Fillable fields**: 83 AcroForm interactive fields across just 2 pages, covering every checkbox, text input, and signature area. This is unusually thorough.
- **Layout**: 10 clearly numbered sections with bold headings provide logical flow and easy scanning.
- **Delivery options**: Seven methods offered (MyBassett Portal, USB, CD, Fax, US Mail, in-person pickup at two locations, Email with encrypted/unencrypted options). The portal-first default is a progressive design choice.
- **Record type selection**: 13 categories plus "Entire Medical Record" and an open-ended "Other" field, with date range controls.
- **Sensitive records**: An opt-out model (Section 6) lets patients exclude categories they don't want disclosed, rather than requiring explicit opt-in for each — a patient-protective default.

**Weaknesses** are minor but notable: two typos ("Frist" for "First", "DISCLOUSRE" for "DISCLOSURE"), internal Windows file paths exposed in the revision line (`d:\forms\hosp\.ofm`), and dense legalese in the rights section — particularly the HIV/AIDS redisclosure paragraph, which is a single four-line sentence. The form does not mention fees or response times.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. The form requires only a patient signature — no notarization, no witness, no in-person submission requirement. The no-conditioning statement is clearly articulated. The one-year date range default ("If left blank, information from the past (1) year will be provided") could inadvertently limit scope for patients seeking older records, but this is a scope default rather than a true barrier.

## Bright Spots

- **Portal-first default delivery** is rare and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **83 fillable fields** on a 2-page form represents exceptional digital-first design.
- **Seven delivery format options** including encrypted email with explicit risk acknowledgment.
- **Opt-out model for sensitive records** defaults toward completeness.
- **No-conditioning language** explicitly protects patient rights.

## Overall Assessment

A.O. Fox Hospital, through its parent Bassett Healthcare Network, provides a technically excellent form that is easy to find and free of major barriers. The form's primary limitation is structural: it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual right of access — through a generic authorization framework designed for third-party release. While the form accommodates patient self-access well, it does not center it. A dedicated patient access pathway or a clearly separated section for self-access requests would elevate this from a good form to an exemplary one. Grade: **B**.

# Lane County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lane County Hospital is a government-owned, independent critical access hospital in Dighton, Kansas. The facility offers a single pathway for medical records requests: a one-page PDF authorization form available on its website. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient self-access form.

## Available Pathways and Form Classification

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "Authorization for Release of Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for third-party release of information. It uses the standard disclosure structure — "I authorize [entity] to disclose... to [name]" — which frames the transaction as releasing records to someone other than the patient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the authorizing party and the recipient, navigating a form that was not designed with their use case in mind.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access requests and third-party authorization releases. There is no separate patient access request form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 individual access rights, and no streamlined process for patients who simply want to review or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was exceptionally easy. A basic web search immediately identified the hospital's Records Request page, which contains a single "Click Here" link to the PDF. No login, bot blocking, or portal navigation was required. For a small rural hospital, this level of web accessibility is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally created PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore lines, requiring the patient to print the form and complete it by hand (or use third-party PDF annotation tools). The form is one page long with a logical flow: patient identification at top, authorization body, 16 record-type checkboxes, legal disclosures, and signature block. The record-type checkboxes offer strong granularity — 16 categories from Anesthesia Records to Social Work Reports — giving patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.

The language is a mix of plain language and standard legal boilerplate. Some sentences are convoluted ("I understand that I may refuse to sign this Authorization and that my treatment of payment for my treatment will not be affected...") but the form is generally readable. The title contains a typo ("HEATH" instead of "HEALTH") that has persisted since at least 2018. "Psychotherapy Notes" appears twice in the checkbox list, and a cryptic "RESOURCE: MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FORM" reference at the bottom could confuse patients.

## Submission and Barriers

The form directs patients to return it via **fax** to one of two numbers. No email, mail, or online submission option is mentioned. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway.

Two unnecessary barriers stand out. First, the form requests a **Social Security Number**, which is not required for HIPAA-compliant release processing and creates identity theft risk on a form routinely transmitted by fax. Second, a **witness signature line** creates an implicit expectation that a witness is needed, though HIPAA does not require one for valid authorization. Together these add friction and potential deterrence for patients acting alone.

No fees are mentioned. The form includes solid compliance elements: an expiration field, a citation of Kansas SB 119's one-year authorization limit, and clear revocation instructions naming the Privacy Officer with full contact information.

## Overall Assessment

Lane County Hospital makes its records request form easy to find and keeps it concise at one page with good record-type granularity. However, the form funnels all requesters — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization designed for disclosure to others, not for individual access. The lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, and the witness signature line create unnecessary friction. For a small critical access hospital, the web accessibility is commendable, but the form itself reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-centered approach to individual access rights.

# Heartland Community Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Heartland Community Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Lawrence, Kansas, serving patients across three locations. The organization provides a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" — for all records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party release.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page PDF titled "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" (form-1.pdf), hosted in the organization's WordPress uploads directory. This form serves all release purposes — patient access, provider-to-provider transfers, insurance disputes, and referrals. A "Patient's Request" checkbox appears among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Records From" and "Records To" fields) is oriented around third-party transfer rather than individual access. A patient requesting records for personal use would find it unclear how to complete the "Records To" section.

Submission options are reasonable: email (medrecords@heartlandhealth.org), fax (785-856-0375), and mail. A phone line for questions (785-842-4477, Option 5) is also provided. These multiple channels meet the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was not discoverable through generic web searches but was found via a site-scoped search (`site:heartlandhealth.org`). The URL is descriptive and the download was straightforward once located. The form is not prominently linked from obvious patient-facing pages — it lives in a WordPress uploads directory, suggesting it may be embedded on an interior page but is not surfaced in primary navigation or a patient resources section.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally-created, single-page PDF with a full text layer — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it functions as a print-and-handwrite document. The layout is logically ordered (demographics → record types → delivery method → from/to → purpose → legal disclosures → signature → return instructions) and fits everything onto a single page, though the density is high with 16 fonts and tight spacing.

The form uses approximately 20+ data entry points (name, DOB, address, phones, date ranges, multiple checkbox groups, records from/to blocks, signature lines). The opening line — "To treat you effectively, your provider needs to review your past medical records" — is patient-friendly, though it subtly frames the form around incoming records transfer rather than patient-initiated access.

One notable design feature is the pre-bundled "Record Set" option, which offers a thoughtfully curated default bundle (last 3 visit notes, recent labs, medication list, immunization records, screening reports, and specialist list). This reduces decision burden for patients who want comprehensive records.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Witness requirement**: A "Witness" signature line is present but never explicitly stated as required. Its inclusion may deter patients or create confusion about whether a witness is actually needed.

**Mental health records**: These require a completely separate form and cannot be combined with other record types on the same submission, creating an additional barrier for patients seeking comprehensive records.

**Email liability disclaimers**: Two separate liability waivers for email delivery appear on the form, which may discourage patients from choosing this convenient option.

**Fees**: No fees are mentioned anywhere on the form — neither disclosed nor waived.

**Compliance language**: The form properly addresses revocation rights, 12-month expiration, treatment non-conditioning, and re-disclosure warnings. However, it does not reference the patient's Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Overall Assessment

Heartland Community Health Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The form is accessible online (with some searching), offers multiple submission channels, and includes some patient-friendly elements like the pre-bundled record set and plain-language opening. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party release framing, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of any dedicated patient access pathway all work against patient-centeredness. The form is adequate for its purpose but was not designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. For an FQHC serving a population that may face literacy or technology barriers, the non-fillable format and dense layout represent meaningful obstacles.

# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore is part of the Hillcrest HealthCare System (Ardent Health Services), and all medical records requests are handled through the parent system's centralized infrastructure. Two PDFs were downloaded during research, but only one is relevant: **form-2.pdf** is the system-wide "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (HMC1072, Rev. 08/18), which lists Hillcrest Hospital Claremore among nine facilities via checkboxes. Form-1.pdf belongs to an entirely unrelated practice — Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego, CA — and was a false-positive search result retained per study protocol.

Beyond the paper form, the system's Medical Records Request page advertises two digital pathways: **MyChart** (patient portal) and a **Swellbox** online request wizard (hosted at swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html). The paper form is thus the weakest of three available channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** clearly differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The paper form is a generic HIPAA authorization covering both disclosure *to* and receipt *from* third parties in a single document. It includes "At the request of the patient or patient's representative" as one purpose checkbox among Insurance, Continued treatment, Legal, and Other — framing patient access as merely one use case rather than a distinct right. The form makes no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

However, the availability of the Swellbox online wizard suggests the system may have a more patient-centric digital pathway. The paper form alone is clearly designed for the traditional release-of-information workflow, not individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search led directly to the system-wide Medical Records Request page at hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/, reachable in 2–3 clicks from the main website. The page clearly presents multiple pathways (MyChart, Swellbox, paper form). One minor friction point: direct searches for "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" specifically did not surface the form — a patient must navigate through or discover the parent system's centralized page.

## Form Document Quality

The paper form (form-2.pdf) is a **digitally created PDF with zero fillable fields**, forcing patients to print and handwrite all entries. This is a missed opportunity — the form was created digitally but not made interactive. The document is effectively one page of content duplicated as a carbon-copy format (page 1 for the facility, page 2 for the patient), a vestige of physical paper workflows.

The layout follows a logical flow: facility selection → patient identification → authorization body → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. However, the "I understand" section is a dense block of legalistic text with minimal visual separation. Record type options are clinically specific (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, etc.) with no "all records" or "entire medical record" checkbox. The checkbox characters extract as Khmer script (U+17A2), indicating a font-mapping issue that breaks assistive technology.

The language is **moderately legalistic**, particularly the sensitive-information acknowledgment paragraph, which is a single run-on sentence listing communicable diseases.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release the entities listed above, their agents and employees from any liability" as a condition of authorizing disclosure — not required by HIPAA and a red flag.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Normal applicable fees, such as copy fees, may apply" with no schedule or estimate.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no mailing address, fax number, or other submission method — patients must figure out delivery independently.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Patients cannot authorize general records release while excluding mental health, HIV, or substance abuse information.
- **No notarization** or witness requirement — a positive.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple request pathways**: The system offers MyChart, Swellbox online wizard, and a paper form — patients have choices.
- **System-wide form clarity**: The facility checkbox design clearly identifies which entities are covered, preventing confusion about facility-specific forms.
- **Easy findability**: The centralized Medical Records Request page is well-organized and accessible.

## Overall Assessment

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore benefits from its parent system's multi-channel approach to records requests, with digital options (MyChart and Swellbox) supplementing the paper form. However, the paper form itself — the only downloadable document — is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, legalistic language, and a problematic liability waiver. The organization earns credit for pathway availability and findability, but the form document quality and lack of patient access differentiation hold it back. A patient who only finds the paper form faces a distinctly paper-era experience; a patient who discovers the online pathways has a better route. Overall: **adequate infrastructure, mediocre form document, no patient-access differentiation**.

# Flowers Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Flowers Hospital in Dothan, Alabama, is a 235-bed for-profit community hospital owned by Triad of Alabama LLC and operating within the Community Health Systems (CHS) network. Three documents were retrieved: the hospital's official "Patient Request for Health Information" form (HIM-1406) in both English (form-2.pdf) and Spanish (form-3.pdf), plus an incidental release form from Wiregrass Surgical Associates, an affiliated practice housed at the hospital's Doctor's Center (form-1.pdf). The primary form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, the English HIM-1406.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated and Patient-Centered

Flowers Hospital provides a genuinely patient-centered access pathway. The official form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" — not "Authorization for Release" or "HIPAA Disclosure Form" — framing the interaction around the patient's own right of access. The form's recipient section lists "Myself" as the first option, with "Personal Representative" and "Other Third Party" as secondary choices. This clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release within a single, well-structured document.

Beyond the PDF, the hospital's medical records page offers an online request portal via Swellbox, providing a fully digital submission alternative. Between the fillable PDF (submittable via fax or mail) and the Swellbox portal, patients have multiple electronic submission options — no in-person visit or postal mail is required.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's website has a "Request Medical Records" page accessible from the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation. That page links directly to both the English and Spanish PDF forms and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative searching was needed. This is a model of how a hospital should surface its records request process.

## Form Document Quality

The HIM-1406 form is a single-page, digitally-designed PDF created in Adobe InDesign with 66 fillable AcroForm fields — an impressive level of interactivity for a one-page form. Every text input, checkbox, and selection area is digitally fillable, allowing patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing.

The form follows a logical seven-section flow: patient demographics, facility identification, record type selection (13 checkboxes including "Entire Record"), sensitive information opt-in (5 categories covering substance abuse, HIV, genetics, and psychiatric records), delivery method, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and accessible throughout. Five delivery methods are offered: paper, email (with appropriate risk disclosure), removable media (with password-protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media option with a password-protection toggle is an unusually thoughtful feature.

The Spanish version (HIM-1406S) is a complete, professional translation with identical structure and field count, linked co-equally alongside the English form — not a machine-generated afterthought.

## Barriers and Concerns

No significant barriers exist. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, and no excessive fee schedule. The form does include a witness signature field whose status as required or optional is ambiguous — this could deter patients completing the form at home. The fee disclosure is vague ("There may be charges associated with processing a request"), giving patients no way to estimate costs upfront. While not affirmatively problematic, greater fee transparency would better serve patients.

The form begins with an unexplained "*ROI*" header (internal jargon for "Release of Information") and the fillable fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader accessibility. The footer on the Spanish form remains in English — a minor inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

Flowers Hospital represents a strong example of patient-centered records access. The dedicated patient access form with "Myself" as the primary option, the comprehensive fillable PDF, the co-equal Spanish translation, the Swellbox portal alternative, and the easy findability from the main website all demonstrate genuine attention to the patient experience. The minor issues — ambiguous witness field, vague fee language, accessibility gaps — prevent a perfect score but do not materially impede a patient requesting their own records. This organization earns a grade of **A**.

# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Medical Center (CMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Toms River, NJ, part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also offers a Ciox/Swellbox online records request portal as the primary pathway for patients.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF documents were downloaded:

- **form-1.pdf** — A CMC-specific one-page "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility" (2017, image-only scan, no fillable fields). This is the legacy facility-level outbound release form.
- **form-2.pdf** — A one-page "Request for Release of Health Information *to* CMC" (2015/2021, image-only scan). This is an inbound records transfer form and is **not relevant** for a patient requesting their own records.
- **form-3.pdf** — The system-wide RWJBH "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (3 pages, Nov 2025, has text layer but no fillable fields). This is the most current and comprehensive form, covering all RWJBH locations. It is the best available PDF for patient self-access.

Beyond PDF forms, the medical records page prominently features a **Ciox/Swellbox online portal** for electronic records requests. Fax (732-557-2209) and email (cmcroimedicalrecords@rwjbh.org) submission options are also available.

## Patient Access Pathway

CMC does not offer a dedicated form specifically designed for patient self-access. Both the legacy CMC form (form-1) and the system-wide form (form-3) are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient access, third-party requests, insurance, legal, and continuing care. On form-3, "Personal" appears as a purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care/Treatment," "Insurance," and "Legal," but the patient must name themselves as the recipient in a field clearly designed for third-party organizations. The Swellbox online portal, however, may provide a more patient-centric experience as a purpose-built records request tool, and the organization directs patients toward it as the primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was straightforward. A direct web search for CMC medical records authorization returned the facility's medical records page immediately. The page links to the CMC-specific forms and references the online portal. The system-wide form (form-3) required a separate search at the RWJBH system level. No bot blocking or authentication barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing form-3 (the best available PDF): the document has a text layer and clean digital rendering (created in Word, not scanned), but **lacks fillable fields** — a patient must print it and complete it by hand. The layout is well-organized with a logical flow: patient demographics → facility selection → recipient → delivery method → record types → purpose → legal terms → signature. Record type selection is granular (15+ checkboxes including behavioral health, pathology, and imaging). Page 3 provides a helpful contact directory for all RWJBH facility HIM departments. Legal text on page 2 is dense but not impenetrably so. The facility checkbox grid on page 1 is visually crowded but functional. The older CMC-specific forms (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans with zero accessibility — no text layer, no fillable fields, no screen reader support.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-3 includes anti-conditioning language ("my refusal will not affect the start, continuation or quality of my medical treatment") and clear revocation rights. No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is **vague**: records are free when sent to another provider for care, but "there may be a fee" for other requests with no schedule or amounts provided. HIPAA cost-based fee limits for patient access are not mentioned. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The 180-day authorization expiration is reasonable.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods** on form-3: paper pickup, US Mail, encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format" — far better than most ROI forms.
- **Online portal** (Swellbox) provides a fully digital pathway alongside PDF forms.
- **Comprehensive contact directory** (page 3) with phone and fax for every RWJBH HIM department.
- **Multiple submission channels**: fax, email, online portal, and mail.

## Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any PDF form despite digital creation.
- **Generic authorization form** — no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow.
- **Opaque fee disclosure** — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.
- **Legacy CMC forms** (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans that remain linked on the website alongside the modern system-wide form, creating potential confusion.

## Overall Assessment

Community Medical Center earns a **B** overall. The organization benefits significantly from the Swellbox online portal and strong delivery method options on the system-wide form. The retrieval experience is easy and multiple submission channels exist. However, the PDF forms are non-fillable and generic, the fee disclosure is vague, and there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow. The coexistence of legacy image-only scans alongside a modern system-wide form reflects incomplete digital modernization.

# Mankato Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mankato Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Mankato, Minnesota. Two PDF forms were found — both versions of the same "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" document (form MC032). Form-1 (revised 02/23) is the current version; form-2 (revised 07/20) is a superseded version that remains publicly accessible. The clinic also offers an online medical record request tool and accepts submissions via fax, email, and DocuSign, providing patients with multiple channels beyond the PDF form itself.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Mankato Clinic does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. Both forms use a generic two-party structure — "Release my medical records from" (source) and "Share my medical records with" (destination) — requiring a patient who wants their own records to awkwardly list Mankato Clinic as the source and themselves as the destination. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no indication that patients have a legal right to obtain their records. The form is framed entirely as a release/disclosure authorization.

That said, the clinic does offer an **online medical record request tool** at a separate URL, which may provide a more streamlined patient self-access experience. The ROI page also notes that DocuSign is accepted, and patients can submit signed authorizations by fax (507-388-1878) or email (ROI@mankatoclinic.com). This gives patients practical electronic submission options even though the PDF form itself is print-oriented.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced direct PDF links and the dedicated Release of Information page at `mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/`. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The ROI page provides clear contact information and links to both the PDF form and the online request tool. One minor concern: both the current and superseded form versions remain live with no redirect or deprecation notice, which could confuse patients.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — page 1 is the authorization, page 2 is a full page of field-by-field instructions. Despite being natively digital, the form has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, handwrite, and return via fax or mail. The policy that "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized" reinforces the print-and-sign workflow.

The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → source → destination → record types → reason → signature. Section headers use bolded questions ("WHO HAS INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE RELEASED?") with sidebar labels, creating a clear visual hierarchy. The form-1 revision improved readability by replacing clinical labels ("Health Care Facility / Provider") with plain language ("Release my medical records from"). The 11 record-type checkboxes cover a reasonable range including sensitive categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health/substance abuse). The instruction page is a genuine bright spot — section-by-section guidance that is uncommon and practically useful.

The form is English-only. Field count is moderate (approximately 20 fields including patient demographics, source/destination addresses, checkboxes, and signature). The legal boilerplate is clear and reasonably concise.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **Fees**: Vaguely disclosed — "I understand there may be a charge" with no amounts or schedule. Patients cannot anticipate costs before submitting.
- **Turnaround**: 7–10 business days stated, well within HIPAA's 30-day window.
- **Witness line**: The older form-2 includes a "Witnessed by" line (removed in form-1), which could have been perceived as a barrier.
- **Delivery options**: The form lists physical delivery methods only (given, mailed, faxed, pick up). The older form-2 instructions explicitly state "Medical records are not able to be emailed." No electronic delivery option appears on either form.
- **Authorization expiration**: 12 months with written revocation — standard and compliant.
- **Treatment conditioning**: Properly disclosed with HIPAA-compliant exceptions.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated instruction page** with practical guidance ("We prioritize requests by appointment date")
- **Multiple ROI contact points** — three offices with dedicated phone/fax, plus email
- **Accepts any HIPAA-compliant form**, including the Minnesota Standard Consent Form
- **Online request tool** available as an alternative to the PDF form
- **Modernized plain-language labels** in the current form version

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable fields on a natively digital PDF — an unnecessary friction point
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release
- Vague fee disclosure with no specific amounts
- No mention of patient rights or HIPAA Right of Access
- Two versions of the same form hosted simultaneously without deprecation notice

## Overall Assessment

Mankato Clinic makes its ROI form easy to find and provides multiple submission channels (fax, email, online tool), which removes the most critical access barriers. The form itself is well-organized with an unusually helpful instruction page. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization framing (no patient access pathway differentiation), and vague fee disclosure keep it from excelling. The organization's practical accommodations — multiple contact points, alternative submission methods, acceptance of any HIPAA-compliant form — partially compensate for the form's design limitations.

# Lincoln Hospital (Davenport, WA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lincoln Hospital, a small government-owned critical access hospital in rural eastern Washington, publishes two ROI forms on its Health Records page: a **clinics version** (form-1.pdf) for records held at North Basin Medical Clinics and a **hospital version** (form-2.pdf) for hospital records. Both are titled "Authorization for Release of Health Care Information and Records" and share nearly identical structure and legal boilerplate. The forms are reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Health Records), making them reasonably easy to find.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information — the page 1 structure asks patients to specify a recipient for records, with fields for the recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. Page 2 of each form includes an "ACCESS REQUEST" section that acknowledges the patient's right to inspect and obtain copies of their own records, making the forms technically dual-purpose. However, a patient requesting their own records receives no clear guidance on how to fill out the third-party-oriented page 1 — should they list themselves as the recipient? The form doesn't say. The "At the request of the Patient" purpose checkbox and "Given to Patient" delivery option exist but are not prominently featured as a distinct pathway.

## Form Document Quality

The hospital form (form-2.pdf) is the technically superior document: it has a full text layer (7,364 characters extractable), making it screen-reader accessible and searchable. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. The clinics form (form-1.pdf) is worse: a scanned image of a paper document with no extractable text whatsoever, rendering it completely inaccessible to assistive technology.

Both forms are 2 pages and reasonably organized. Page 1 uses labeled sections (Types of Information, Purpose, Revocation, Re-Disclosure, No Conditions, Time Frame, Consent of Minor) with clear visual hierarchy. The language mixes plain English with necessary legal terminology; sections like the "No Conditions" statement are clear, while the sensitive-information preamble is dense legalese. The hospital form's "OFFICE USE" section appears near patient-facing fields without clear labeling, potentially confusing patients about what they need to fill out.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were found through web search and confirmed on the hospital website. The Health Records page returned a 403 error to automated fetch tools (likely bot blocking), requiring browser access, but loaded normally in a standard browser. One alternate URL for the clinics form returned HTTP 400, suggesting stale links. Overall findability was good — a patient navigating the website would locate these forms without difficulty.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant concern is the **fee structure**. The clinics form cites Washington's WAC 246-08-400 fee schedule ($26.00 search/base fee, $1.17/page for first 30 pages, $0.88/page thereafter plus tax) — fees designed for third-party record duplication that likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests. Worse, this fee schedule references dates of September 2017 through June 2019, making it nearly seven years expired. The hospital form takes a different approach: its fee field reads "$______ per page" with the amount left blank — unhelpful for patients trying to anticipate costs.

The clinics form requires patients to attach a copy of photo identification, which goes beyond HIPAA requirements and creates an additional burden. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both forms correctly state a 30-day response time (60 days for off-site records) with one possible 30-day extension, aligning with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

The clinics form offers electronic delivery options — "MyChart Secure Patient Portal, CD, USB Flash Drive (provided by patient)" — a notably progressive feature for a small rural critical access hospital. The "Most recent two (2) years" date range shortcut with specific clinical examples (colonoscopy, mammogram, DEXA, diabetic exams) is patient-friendly. Both forms include an explicit "No Conditions" statement and detailed minor consent provisions aligned with Washington State law.

## Overall Assessment

Lincoln Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and include some thoughtful patient-facing features (electronic delivery options, clinical shortcuts), but fundamental issues undermine the experience: no fillable fields on either form, a generic third-party authorization structure that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, potentially excessive fees, and one form that is an image-only scan. The organization deserves credit for acknowledging patient access rights on page 2 of each form but falls short of providing a clear, patient-centric access pathway.

# Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center provides two distinct PDF forms for health information requests, both accessible from a centralized, facility-specific medical records page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/medical-records-wa/sacred-heart`:

1. **Form 1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" — a general third-party authorization form for disclosing records to an external recipient (insurer, attorney, another provider, etc.). 2 pages, 37 fillable fields.
2. **Form 2** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — a dedicated patient access form for individuals requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). 2 pages, 45 fillable fields.

The facility also offers Spanish versions of both forms, plus additional forms for amendments, accounting of disclosures, restriction/revocation, and Health Information Exchange opt-out — a comprehensive suite rarely seen at individual facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release. The dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" form uses correct HIPAA terminology and is purpose-built for patients requesting their own records. This separation is a significant strength — many organizations force patients through a single generic authorization form regardless of whether they want their own records or are authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was effortless. A single web search returned direct links to the facility-specific medical records page. The page is cleanly organized, with clearly labeled PDF download links and no bot blocking, login walls, or portal gatekeeping. URL naming is descriptive (`wa-sacred-heart-access-designated-record-set.pdf`), and the page is reachable through Providence's main navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form 2 — Primary Patient Access Form)

Form 2 is a natively digital 2-page PDF with 45 interactive fillable fields — checkboxes for record types, delivery formats, and text fields for demographics and date ranges. The form is not an image scan. Page 1 provides instructional text and institutional notices; page 2 contains the input fields. The layout is clean and logically organized.

Five delivery format options are offered: MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, and Fax. The MyChart integration is particularly strong, meeting patients where they likely already have an account. Patients can select specific record types, date ranges, and facilities. A "Last 2 years only" convenience checkbox is a practical touch.

The language is reasonably plain, though it includes some boilerplate legal text. The form includes multilingual language assistance notices (English, Spanish, Chinese) with a toll-free phone number and TTY access. Spanish versions of both forms are separately available.

## Barriers

**Signature**: Both forms require a wet signature ("Print form and sign by hand"), which prevents fully digital completion despite the otherwise comprehensive fillable fields. This is the single most significant barrier.

**Fees**: Form 2 states "Fees may be associated with this request" without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based fee standard. Patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by fax ((509) 474-4815), email (PSHMC.HIMRecords@Providence.org), or mail — multiple remote submission options are available, so in-person delivery is not required.

**No notarization** is required. **No response time** is stated.

## Red Flags and Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The patient access form (form 2) includes a liability release clause typically found on third-party authorization forms, which is inappropriate for a patient exercising their Right of Access. The form also lacks any explicit statement of patient rights (right to receive records, 30-day response timeline, right to appeal denial).

**Bright spots**: The dedicated patient access form, five delivery formats including MyChart, multi-facility awareness ("we would be glad to fax a copy of this form to other facilities"), the centralized portal with Spanish translations, and the proactive SSN disclosure warning on form 1 all demonstrate above-average patient-centeredness.

## Overall Assessment

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center offers one of the better patient access experiences among community hospitals. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, five electronic delivery options, and an exceptionally well-organized web portal demonstrate genuine investment in patient-centered records access. The wet signature requirement and vague fee language are the main drawbacks, preventing a top-tier score. The organization earns a strong B overall — clearly above average, with room for improvement in digital workflow completion and rights transparency.

# Baptist Health Lexington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Baptist Health Lexington is a community hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, part of the Baptist Health (Kentucky) system. It does not maintain facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it relies on system-wide forms published by the parent system at baptisthealth.com. Three documents were retrieved, all system-level.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found:

1. **Form 1 (Primary):** "Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — the current system-wide authorization form, revised February 2026. A 3-page, dual-purpose document covering both patient self-access ("Myself" checkbox) and third-party release ("Other person/organization" checkbox). Includes delivery method options (paper, fax, email, CD, MyChart), record type packages, sensitive information consent, and a helpful "Tips" page. Submission is via fax or mail to a centralized Release of Information office in Louisville.

2. **Form 2:** "Request for Medical Records" — a simpler, 1-page patient-access-specific form hosted on the MyChart portal (mychart.baptist-health.org). Explicitly framed for patients requesting their own records. Dated July 2019, making it nearly seven years old. Notably, it contains no submission instructions — no address, fax number, or email.

3. **Form 3:** An older, undated version of the same system-wide authorization (Form 1). Two pages, still publicly accessible alongside the 2026 version at a non-versioned URL, creating potential patient confusion.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Baptist Health demonstrates partial differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (Form 1) is a generic HIPAA authorization, but it clearly labels a "Myself" option on its first page and notes that purpose of release is "not required if being disclosed directly to patient." A dedicated patient access form (Form 2) does exist but is outdated and lacks submission instructions, making it less useful in practice. The primary pathway a patient would encounter — through the medical records page at baptisthealth.com — is the generic authorization form with a patient self-access checkbox.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Basic web searches and the organization's medical records page led directly to downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The only friction is that a patient searching specifically for "Baptist Health Lexington" must recognize that the parent system's form applies. The coexistence of old and new form versions at similar URLs is a minor navigational hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (Form 1) is digitally authored with a text layer and clean typography, but has **zero fillable fields**. All entry areas are blank lines and non-interactive checkbox graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is well-organized with clear section headers (Patient Info, Release To / Delivery Method, Purpose, Information to Release) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. The record type "Package" system (Key Documentation vs. All Documentation) with detailed descriptions is genuinely helpful. The third page ("Tips for Requesting Medical Record Copies") provides useful practical guidance including a 15-calendar-day turnaround goal, MyChart default delivery, and contact information.

Language is mostly plain on page 1 but dense with required legal text on page 2 — HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder (42 CFR Part 2), revocation rights, and re-disclosure warnings. The sensitive information consent is bundled as an all-or-nothing authorization with no opt-out for individual categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Not fillable:** Despite being digitally created, no forms offer interactive fields — a significant missed opportunity.
- **SSN collection:** The last 4 digits of SSN are requested without being marked optional, exceeding what HIPAA requires for patient identification.
- **Sensitive information bundling:** The authorization bundles consent for mental health, HIV/AIDS, and substance use disorder records with no ability to exclude specific categories.
- **Outdated form still live:** Form 3 (undated older version) remains publicly accessible and could lead patients to use a superseded form with a potentially incorrect mailing address.
- **No fees mentioned:** While appropriate for patient access under HIPAA, the absence of any fee information leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart as default delivery:** If no delivery method is specified, records default to the patient's Baptist Health MyChart account — a patient-friendly, electronic-first approach.
- **Package-based record selection:** The tiered Package 1/Package 2 system with clear descriptions simplifies an inherently complex choice.
- **Toll-free phone support:** Contact information includes both local and toll-free numbers, plus a dedicated MyChart support line.
- **15-day turnaround goal:** Proactively commits to a faster-than-required timeline (HIPAA allows 30 days).
- **Multiple delivery options:** Paper, fax, email, CD, and MyChart cover a wide range of patient preferences.

## Overall Assessment

Baptist Health Lexington, through its parent system, provides a competent but conventional records request process. The primary form is well-organized and clearly accommodates patient self-access, but the reliance on a non-fillable PDF and fax/mail submission keeps this firmly in the traditional paper-workflow category. The existence of a dedicated patient access form (Form 2) shows awareness of the distinction, but its outdated status and missing submission instructions undercut its value. The bright spots — MyChart default delivery, helpful tips page, and clear package descriptions — demonstrate patient-centered thinking within the constraints of a legacy form design.

# Synthesis: Aurora Medical Center - Grafton

## Overview

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton is a community hospital in Grafton, Wisconsin, operated by Advocate Health (formerly Advocate Aurora Health). The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones, drawing from Aurora Health Care's centralized medical records infrastructure. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also directs patients to its LiveWell patient portal for online record access.

## Forms and Pathways

Three forms were downloaded:

- **Form-1 and Form-2** are identical copies (same form number S300503 Rev. 11/25, same byte size) of the general "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a third-party release form designed for authorizing disclosure to other providers, insurers, or attorneys. Two URLs exist for the same document, a minor source of confusion.
- **Form-3** is a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" (S88411-EN Rev. 11/25) — explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It features a "Myself" checkbox, omits the purpose-of-release requirement, and opens with a callout to the LiveWell patient portal.

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3**. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, separate from the third-party authorization, is a meaningful structural choice that many organizations fail to make.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Aurora clearly differentiates individual access from third-party release. Form-3 is titled and structured around the patient's own request — no "Release the Requested Information to" recipient block, no purpose-of-release field, and a prominent "Myself" option. The patient portal callout ("Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org") is placed at the very top of the form, proactively directing patients to a faster digital channel before they even begin filling out the paper form. This is a best-practice design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Aurora Health Care maintains a well-organized medical records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records`, reachable in about two clicks from the homepage. The page clearly lists all available forms with download links, including English and Spanish versions, instruction sheets, restriction request forms, accounting of disclosures, and revocation forms. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The forms also appeared in web search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean typography and logical section flow: patient demographics → treatment context → record type selection → recipient → delivery method → signature. The record-type selection is impressively granular, with 22+ checkbox options spanning medical records, imaging by modality, billing documents, and laboratory reports. The language is plain and accessible — the sensitive-information acknowledgment is straightforward without being alarming.

However, despite being digitally produced, form-3 has **zero interactive fillable fields**. All checkboxes are static glyphs, and all blanks require handwriting. This is the form's most significant weakness — adding fillable fields would be trivial for the design team and would dramatically improve the digital experience. The form is designed as a print-and-fill artifact published as a PDF.

## Submission and Delivery

The medical records page lists multiple submission methods: email, fax, mail, and in-person delivery. The form itself offers multiple delivery methods for receiving records: paper by mail, encrypted email, CD, patient portal, and in-person pickup. Offering both encrypted email and patient portal as electronic delivery options is progressive. The note "(Fees may apply)" appears but no fee amounts or schedule are provided — a common ambiguity.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The form correctly omits a purpose-of-release requirement for patient access. Non-discrimination language is present on the third-party form. Minor authorization provisions are detailed and legally careful. The main compliance gap is the vague fee disclosure — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

## Overall Assessment

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton, through its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form, a patient portal alternative, Spanish translations, and granular record-type selection. The retrieval experience is excellent and the content design is clear and well-organized. The primary weakness is the non-fillable PDF format, which forces a paper workflow despite the form being digitally authored. This technical gap prevents the organization from reaching the top tier, but the overall experience is solidly good — a patient requesting their own records has a clear, well-documented pathway with multiple submission and delivery options.

**Grade: B** (weighted score: 4.15/5.0)

# Scenic Mountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Scenic Mountain Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Big Spring, TX, affiliated with a regional health system. The hospital's medical records page offers two pathways for requesting records: downloadable PDF authorization forms (in English and Spanish) and an electronic request option via a Sharecare/HDS platform. Two PDF forms were retrieved — an English authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are structurally identical general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

The most significant finding is that Scenic Mountain Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. Both PDF forms are titled "Patient Request / Authorization to Use and/or Disclose Protected Health Information," but their structure is that of a standard third-party authorization: Section 2 asks patients to name the recipient ("Person or Facility Name"), requiring a patient requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as both requester and recipient. The "Personal" checkbox under Purpose of Disclosure (Section 8) is the only accommodation for self-access, and there is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. This means patients exercising their individual access rights are funneled through an authorization framework designed for third-party disclosures — a legally distinct process that may result in inappropriate application of authorization-based rules (restricted release signatures, purpose requirements) to what should be a straightforward access request.

The medical records page does mention an electronic request option via a Sharecare/HDS platform, which may provide a more patient-centered digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms do not reflect this differentiation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search for the hospital's medical records release form led directly to the medical records page at `scenicmountainmedical.com/medical-records/`, which provides clear download links for both English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, authentication, or portal login was required. The PDFs are hosted on a secondary WordPress domain (`scenicmountainmedicalcenter.org`), which is slightly confusing from a URL standpoint but transparent to the end user. The page also provides phone and fax contact information.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and return the form. This is a significant missed opportunity: the structured layout with numbered sections, checkboxes, and signature lines would translate well to an interactive PDF.

The form is well-organized with 15 numbered sections following a logical progression: patient identification → recipient → delivery method → date range → record types → restricted release → exclusions → purpose → expiration → legal disclosures → signatures. Section 5 provides 11 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, imaging, discharge summary, etc.) with write-in options, giving patients meaningful control over their request. Section 7 allows patients to exclude specific visits — an uncommon and thoughtful feature.

The legal disclosures on page 2 (Sections 10–13) are dense paragraph-style text that will challenge many readers, but the front-page sections are clear and practical. The bold footer warning — "THIS AUTHORIZATION IS NOT VALID UNLESS ALL APPLICABLE ENTRIES ARE COMPLETED" — could discourage patients who find some sections inapplicable.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form's fee notice ("*fees may apply") is vague, providing no schedule, amounts, or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations for patient access requests. This ambiguity could deter patients. A witness signature line appears next to the patient signature but is not labeled as optional or required — if enforced, this would impose a barrier not required by HIPAA. No notarization is required, and multiple delivery methods (email, postal mail, in-person pickup) are offered. Fax is available for form submission, providing an adequate electronic pathway.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language form**: A fully translated Spanish authorization form is available, appropriately serving the demographics of West Texas. Both language versions are prominently linked on the same page.
- **Email delivery option**: The form includes email as a delivery method — uncommon among facilities and patient-friendly.
- **Granular scope controls**: Patients can select specific record types, specify date ranges, and exclude particular visits.
- **Practical expiration option**: The "until fulfilled" expiration choice is well-suited to one-time patient access requests.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient access differentiation**: The generic authorization framework is the only PDF-based option, conflating two legally distinct HIPAA processes.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form requires printing and handwriting.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: No specifics on costs, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **Translation errors in Spanish form**: A grammatical error in the bold warning text and a duplicate "Ciudad" label where "Estado" should appear undermine the quality of the Spanish version.

## Overall Assessment

Scenic Mountain Medical Center provides an accessible and reasonably well-organized authorization form that is easy to find and available in two languages — a meaningful accommodation for its community. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable PDF format, and vague fee disclosures prevent it from achieving a patient-centered standard. The form serves adequately as a general-purpose authorization but was not designed with the individual patient requesting their own records as the primary use case. **Grade: C (3.30/5.00)**.

# Copley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Copley Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Morrisville, Vermont. The hospital offers a single Release of Information form — titled "Patient Request for Health Information Authorization Form" (Form 1085, dated 07-21) — that serves as the primary pathway for patients seeking their own health records. No patient portal–based request option or online submission wizard was identified; the form is a downloadable PDF linked from the hospital's Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Copley's form is a **dual-purpose authorization** that handles both patient self-access and third-party release on a single page. The form includes a clear checkbox for "Provide a copy of my records to: Me," which meaningfully distinguishes the patient self-access use case — but it does not separate this pathway from third-party release. A patient requesting their own records encounters fields irrelevant to their situation, such as "Release my Records TO:" (with recipient name, address, fax, and phone fields) and "Purpose of Release." Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not state a purpose for requesting their own records, so the presence of this field — without clarification that it's optional for self-requests — could confuse or deter patients.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the phrase "Right of Access." While the authorization language (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure warning) is well-written, the form frames the interaction as an *authorization* rather than an *access right*, which is a conceptual distinction that matters for patient-centeredness.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Copley Hospital's release of information form immediately surfaced a direct link to the PDF. The form is also prominently linked from the Medical Records page under "For Patients + Visitors" in the main site navigation. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was required. The hospital's Medical Records page also links to three related HIPAA forms (amendment request, alternate communication, PHI restrictions), which shows a thoughtful information architecture even if the ROI form itself is the only one relevant to record requests.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page PDF** — impressively compact — with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → delivery/format options → authorization scope → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. The language is largely plain and accessible, with standout phrasing like "My treatment will not be impacted, no matter if I sign this Authorization or not."

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). This means patients must print and hand-fill the form, then fax or mail it back. The delivery and format options are notably strong — in-person pickup, mail, fax, and patient portal for delivery, plus paper copy or electronic copy (email, USB, CD, portal) for format — and the form helpfully notes that "Many documents that you may be requesting are available to you in your patient portal." But the submission process itself requires either fax (802-888-8361) or mail to the HIM department.

## Barriers & Compliance

**No notarization or witness** is required. Representative signers must attach proof of authority, which is a reasonable requirement. The authorization is valid for one year with clear revocation instructions including both mailing and fax addresses.

**Fees are not mentioned** anywhere on the form, leaving patients unable to anticipate costs. This is a notable gap — HIPAA requires transparency about fees for patient access requests.

The form is dated July 2021 and predates the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective April 2023), suggesting it may not reflect current requirements around electronic health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- **Comprehensive delivery and format options** — email, USB, CD, patient portal, fax, mail, and in-person pickup
- **Single-page efficiency** — all necessary content on one page
- **Clear voluntariness statement** in plain language
- **Easy findability** — prominent placement and search-engine accessible

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** — forces a paper workflow despite digital authorship
- **No fee disclosure** — patients cannot anticipate costs
- **"Purpose of Release" field** not flagged as optional for self-requests
- **No explicit Right of Access framing** — treated as authorization rather than access right
- **Form staleness** — over 4 years old, predating information blocking rules

## Overall Assessment

Copley Hospital provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience anchored by easy findability, a compact single-page form, plain language, and strong delivery/format options. The dual-purpose design accommodates patient self-access but doesn't optimize for it. The primary weaknesses — lack of fillable fields and absence of fee disclosure — represent missed opportunities rather than active barriers. Fax submission is available, providing an adequate electronic pathway. For a small critical access hospital, this is a competent if imperfect effort that would benefit from modernization: adding fillable fields, separating or clearly labeling the self-access pathway, and disclosing fee information.

# Gritman Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Gritman Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Moscow, Idaho. The organization provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form for all records requests. There is no patient portal–based request option and no dedicated patient access form — patients requesting their own records use the same document as those authorizing release to a third party.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page fillable PDF titled "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (revised 4/1/2024). This form serves both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios, with "RELEASE TO" and "RELEASE FROM" sections on the same document. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), and no patient portal–based request pathway.

The form is linked from the "My Health Records" page on Gritman's website, reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → My Health Records). A web search also surfaces the form quickly. Findability is strong for a small rural hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Gritman does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic HIPAA authorization — a patient requesting their own records fills out the same "RELEASE TO" / "RELEASE FROM" fields as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of the 30-day response requirement, and no guidance distinguishing the patient's stronger legal protections for self-access. The "Purpose" checkboxes include "Personal" as an option, which is the closest the form comes to acknowledging patient self-access, but it carries no special treatment.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **63 fillable fields**, meaning patients can complete it digitally before printing or submitting. It is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient information, release parties, delivery method, purpose, treatment dates, information types, authorization language, and signature. The layout is compact but organized, with clear section headers.

Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legal terminology. The "I UNDERSTAND THAT" section is dense but covers the key compliance elements (revocation, re-disclosure, non-conditioning). The sensitive-information disclosure statement is appropriately specific, listing behavioral health, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing, sickle cell anemia, and substance abuse.

The form offers **five delivery methods**: standard mail, fax, email, pickup, and certified mail. Email availability is a meaningful bright spot — uncommon among small rural facilities. Submission method is less clear: the form header lists a phone number and fax number but does not explicitly instruct patients on how to return the completed form. Patients could reasonably fax it to the listed number.

Field names are absent from the fillable fields, creating an accessibility gap for screen readers. The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Barriers

- **Fees**: The form notes "Continuation of Care (no fee)" for that purpose, implying fees for other purposes including personal requests, but provides no fee schedule or cost estimate. Certified mail carries an unquantified "Add'l Charge."
- **No notarization or witness** required — just patient/guardian signature.
- **No in-person requirement** stated; the fax number in the header provides a reasonable electronic submission pathway.
- **90-day auto-expiration** with a one-year maximum is reasonable.
- **Submission instructions are absent**: No explicit guidance on how to return the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery option** — unusual for a critical access hospital and valuable for rural patients who may live far from the facility.
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific report type checkboxes give patients fine-grained control.
- **"Major Documents for the Last 3 Years"** shortcut — a thoughtful option for patients who don't know exact treatment dates.
- **Recently revised (4/1/2024)** — evidence of active form maintenance.
- **63 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive PDF, not a flat scan.

## Overall Assessment

Gritman Medical Center provides a competent, recently updated, fillable ROI form that is easy to find and reasonably well designed. Its main weakness is the lack of differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — patients are funneled through a generic authorization form that doesn't acknowledge their stronger rights under HIPAA's individual access provisions. Fee transparency is also lacking for personal-use requests. Despite these gaps, the form's fillable fields, email delivery option, and granular record selection make it a serviceable tool for a patient requesting their own records. For a small independent critical access hospital, this represents a solid but not exceptional effort.

# Synthesis: Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin

## Overview

Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (GHC-SCW) is a nonprofit, independent physician practice in Madison, WI. It publishes two distinct ROI-related PDF forms, plus a Spanish-language version of one of them, on a well-organized public forms page. Critically, GHC-SCW is one of the relatively rare organizations that offers a **dedicated patient self-access form** separate from its general third-party authorization — a meaningful structural distinction that demonstrates thoughtful process design around patient rights.

## Forms and Pathways

**Form 1** ("Authorization to Release Protected Health Information From GHC-SCW") is a 2-page general HIPAA authorization form oriented toward third-party release. It covers scenarios like transferring care, insurance, disability determinations, and legal use, with "Personal Use" available as one checkbox option. A Spanish version is also published. While usable for patient self-access, the framing, language, and workflow are designed around the third-party release use case.

**Form 2** ("Patient Request for Health Information Form") is a 1-page, fillable PDF designed specifically for patients requesting their own records. This is the primary form for patient self-access and the basis for scoring. It uses plain-English question-based section headers ("What records do you want?", "How would you like your records delivered?"), offers granular record-type checkboxes with date range scoping, and provides multiple delivery options including paper, email (encrypted by default), CD, USB, and MyChart portal delivery.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

GHC-SCW clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release by maintaining two separate forms. Form 2 is purpose-built for the individual access use case, with simpler language, fewer fields, and a patient-centered workflow. This is a best practice that most organizations do not follow — the typical approach is a single generic authorization form that patients must navigate regardless of whether they're requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. The first web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's forms page at ghcscw.com/members/forms/ is cleanly organized with a "Release of Information Forms" section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA were encountered. One minor quirk: Form 2 was listed under "Health Insurance Forms" rather than "Release of Information Forms," which could cause a patient browsing specifically for ROI forms to miss the more patient-friendly option.

## Form Document Quality

Form 2 is technically excellent: a fully fillable PDF with 49 interactive fields on a single page. The layout is clean and logically ordered (demographics → record selection → delivery method → recipient → signature). The language is accessible and avoids legalese. The form explicitly references the patient's HIPAA right of access and sets a transparent processing timeline of 5 business days.

Form 1, by contrast, has zero fillable fields despite being digitally authored, and explicitly prohibits electronic signatures — creating a print-sign-scan workflow that undermines electronic submission. However, since Form 2 is the primary patient access pathway and is fully fillable, the organization's overall technical accessibility is strong.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: Form 2 states "There may be charges associated with processing a request" without specifying amounts. The notes mention CIOX Health as the ROI vendor and note that "CIOX requires payment for medical records." Fee vagueness leaves patients unable to anticipate costs, and the CIOX involvement raises questions about whether fees are limited to HIPAA's cost-based standard for patient access.

**Submission instructions gap**: Form 2 lacks any indication of where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email. Patients must refer to Form 1 or the website for submission details. Form 1 provides mail, fax (608-441-3499), email (ghcroi@ghcscw.com), and in-person drop-off as options.

**No notarization or witness required**. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a genuine best practice
- **Fully fillable PDF** with 49 interactive fields on one concise page
- **Multiple delivery formats**: paper, encrypted email, CD, USB, MyChart portal
- **Encrypted email as default** with opt-in for unencrypted — privacy by design
- **Spanish-language version** of Form 1 available
- **Plain-language, question-based headers** make the form approachable
- **Transparent processing timeline** (5 business days)

## Overall Assessment

GHC-SCW demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by maintaining a dedicated, well-designed patient access form that is technically fillable, concisely written, and offers flexible delivery options including portal-based delivery. The main weaknesses are the vague fee disclosure, the absence of submission instructions on Form 2 itself, and the use of CIOX Health as the ROI vendor (which may introduce fee concerns). Despite these gaps, the organization's approach to patient record access is meaningfully above average and reflects intentional design around patient rights.

# Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital is a critical access hospital in Miller, SD, part of the Avera Health regional nonprofit system. The facility does not publish its own ROI form; instead, patients use Avera Health's system-wide "Authorization – Release Of Medical Records Information" form (Form 8691-04). Only one form was found applicable to this facility.

## Pathway Assessment: Generic Third-Party Authorization

The sole available form is a **general-purpose HIPAA authorization** designed for disclosure of records between any two parties. It does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third party (attorney, insurer, other provider) requesting records with patient authorization. The form's structure — with separate "Provider (Who is releasing information?)" and "Disclose Information to (Where is information to be sent?)" sections — frames the transaction as a release between entities, not as a patient exercising individual access rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524).

There is no dedicated patient access form, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no simplified workflow for self-access. A patient wanting their own records must complete the same authorization form as a third-party requester, filling in themselves as the recipient. The form does reference 45 CFR 164.524 in its authorization block, acknowledging the right to inspect or obtain copies, but this is buried in legal boilerplate rather than presented as a primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The Hand County facility profile page on avera.org does not link directly to any medical records form. A patient would need to navigate to Avera Health's system-level "Request Medical Records" page or perform a web search. Additionally, Avera's website **blocks automated downloads** (curl/wget return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. The form URL is descriptively named, which is a minor positive.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally generated PDF** with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, making it a print-and-handwrite document. Patients must print, fill by hand, and submit via fax or mail. The layout uses labeled left-margin sections (Patient Identification, Provider, Disclose Information to, etc.) which provide reasonable navigation, but fitting all content onto one page results in a visually dense, cramped document. The language mixes moderately plain English with regulatory references (42 CFR Part 2, 45 CFR 164.524) and HIV/AIDS disclosure warnings — functional but not optimized for patient readability.

The form asks for approximately 15–18 discrete fields including patient demographics, provider information, recipient information, record type checkboxes, date ranges, format preferences, purpose, expiration date, and signature. This is a moderate field count for an authorization form, though several fields (provider address, recipient fax) add complexity that a patient self-access form would not need.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and may deter privacy-conscious patients.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" field is present without clarification of whether it is required or optional. If interpreted as mandatory, this creates an unnecessary barrier.
- **No submission instructions on form**: The form does not print a mailing address or designate the fax number as a submission destination; the Avera fax number (605-322-8200) appears only in the context of "questions about disclosure."
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Charges may apply" for entire record requests with no fee schedule or amounts provided.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: The form offers paper, fax, flash drive, CD-ROM, and email — with encryption by default and an explicit opt-out for unencrypted delivery. This is a notably comprehensive set of format choices.
- **45 CFR 164.524 citation**: Explicit reference to the HIPAA Right of Access provision signals regulatory awareness.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Covering all required elements on one page reduces printing burden.

## Overall Assessment

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital provides a functional but **generic, third-party-oriented** pathway for records access. The form is adequate for its purpose as a system-wide authorization but does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, SSN collection, and ambiguous witness requirement create friction. The strong delivery format options and 45 CFR 164.524 reference are bright spots, but the overall experience reflects an organization that has not optimized for patient-initiated access requests.

# AdventHealth Central Texas — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Central Texas is a nonprofit community hospital in Killeen, TX, part of the major AdventHealth system. Two ROI forms were found: a system-wide authorization form (form-1, ADV-800003A, rev. 2022) and a facility-specific "Request For Access And Authorization" form (form-2, AHCT 616, rev. 2005). Both were easily discoverable via web search, downloaded directly from the AdventHealth CDN with no barriers.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The facility-specific form (form-2) is the more relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. It explicitly includes a checkbox for "Provide me with access to the protected health information specified below" as its first option — a clear patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party disclosure. The system-wide form (form-1), by contrast, is architecturally a third-party disclosure form that funnels all requests through a "Disclose To" entity-naming structure. While it lists "Personal Use" as a purpose, a patient would need to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient.

The existence of both forms creates a "which form?" problem. Neither form references the other, and no landing page was found that explains when to use which. A patient could reasonably download the system-wide form first and never discover the more patient-friendly facility-specific version. That said, the facility-specific form does meaningfully differentiate patient access from third-party release — it presents four distinct action options (access, copies, disclosure to others, summary) rather than treating everything as a third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search for "AdventHealth Central Texas authorization release health information medical records form PDF" surfaced both PDFs immediately. No bot blocking, login walls, or navigation mazes were encountered. The forms are hosted on AdventHealth's CDN at direct URLs. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — full marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are digitally created PDFs with extractable text — neither is a scan. However, **neither form has any fillable/interactive fields** (both have zero fillable fields per metadata). Every field must be completed by hand after printing. This is a significant gap, especially for the system-wide form revised as recently as 2022. The "Affix Patient Label Here" boxes on form-2 further signal a paper-first, in-facility design never adapted for remote digital use.

Form-2 (the primary patient access form) is 2 pages with approximately 20–25 fields. The first page is reasonably organized: action checkboxes, patient demographics, record type selection (12 categories plus catch-alls), and a disclosure recipient section. The second page is a dense block of legal "I understand..." statements followed by signature blocks. The legal language is moderately formal but comprehensible. However, the lack of bullet points or visual separation in the legal text makes it harder to parse.

The system-wide form (form-1) is more complex, with 12 numbered sections spanning 48+ checkbox options across medical/surgical and behavioral health record types. It is visually overwhelming for a routine records request.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-2 requires a witness signature for all requests — not just behavioral health records. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access, making this an unnecessary barrier for patients completing the form at home.

**Fees**: Form-2 mentions a "reasonable, cost-based fee" but provides no specific amounts or fee schedule. The summary option pre-fills a blank for cost, setting an expectation of charges without transparency.

**90-day authorization cap**: Form-2 limits authorization to a maximum of 90 days, which is restrictive and conflates patient access requests (which don't require authorization under HIPAA) with third-party disclosure authorization.

**Wrong state law**: Form-1 references the "Illinois Mental Health and Development Disabilities Confidentiality Act" despite being served at a Texas facility — a clear legal citation error from a system-wide template not adapted for local jurisdiction.

**No notarization required**: Neither form requires notarization. Submission can be done by fax (254-526-7134) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit patient access pathway**: Form-2's first checkbox is "Provide me with access to the protected health information" — a rarity that centers patient self-access.
- **Broad catch-all category**: Form-2 includes "Any other personally identifiable information used by AdventHealth Central Texas to make medical decisions about me" — an unusually expansive request option.
- **Local contact information**: Form-2 provides facility-specific phone and fax numbers, unlike the generic system form.
- **Secure email delivery option**: Form-1 offers secure email as a delivery method, more progressive than fax-only alternatives.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: Both forms correctly state that refusing to sign will not affect treatment or benefits.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Central Texas offers a mixed experience. On the positive side, the facility-specific form includes genuine patient access language and the forms are trivially easy to find online. On the negative side, neither form is fillable, the facility form is over 20 years old, a witness signature creates unnecessary friction, and the two-form landscape creates confusion about which to use. The organization earns credit for having a patient access pathway at all — many peers offer only generic third-party authorization forms — but the execution falls short of modern standards for digital accessibility and form hygiene.

# Coast Plaza Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Coast Plaza Hospital provides two versions of the same "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form on its Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`). Form-1 (June 2024, labeled "FINAL") is the current version; form-2 (January 2022) remains publicly accessible alongside it with no indication of which is current. Both are general-purpose ROI authorization forms — not patient-access-specific documents. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is to download form-1, print and hand-fill it, and fax or mail it to the hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Coast Plaza Hospital does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms use a single "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" workflow. The "Information to be Released to" section asks for "Name of Hospital/Clinic/Physician/Person," framing the recipient as a third party. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in this field, which is unintuitive. While "Personal Use" appears as a purpose option and "Records for Personal Use" as a record-type checkbox, the relationship between these is ambiguous — it's unclear whether selecting one, the other, or both is needed. The form lacks any Right of Access language or statement of patient rights beyond standard authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Multiple search strategies succeeded: a filetype:pdf web search and a site-scoped search both led to the hospital's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering was required. Both PDFs downloaded directly with curl. The only findability concern is the co-existence of two versions without clear versioning — a patient could easily download the outdated 2022 form, which lists a different fax number that may no longer be monitored.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created 2-page PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All ~20+ data entry points (patient name, address, DOB, phone, email, recipient information, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, date range, delivery method, signature) must be completed by hand after printing. The layout is well-organized with bold section headers ("Patient Information," "Information to be Released From," etc.) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. Record types are arranged efficiently in two columns with 16+ individual categories. The language is moderately legalistic — first-person authorization statements are standard but dense. A "PATIENT LABEL" box on both pages is a clinical workflow artifact that may confuse patients completing the form at home.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No fillable fields**: Forces a fully paper-based completion workflow in a form that was digitally designed and could easily support interactive fields.
- **CD-only electronic delivery**: The only electronic format option is CD — functionally obsolete in 2024. No email, portal, or secure download option exists.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "I understand that there may be a fee associated with this request" provides no fee amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee standard, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not tell patients where to send the completed authorization. The hospital's fax number appears in the "Released From" section but is not framed as a return destination.
- **Outdated form still online**: The 2022 version with a different fax number remains downloadable, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record selection**: 16+ specific record types give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **Sensitive category separation**: Mental Health, Genetic Testing, Alcohol/Drug Abuse, and HIV/AIDS records require separate initialing — correctly implementing federal and state requirements.
- **Encryption preference**: The form asks whether patients want records encrypted, a privacy-conscious option rarely seen on ROI forms.
- **No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature.

## Overall Assessment

Coast Plaza Hospital provides a findable, reasonably organized generic ROI form that a patient *can* use for self-access, but the experience is clearly not designed around patient needs. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, CD-only electronic delivery, and generic third-party framing all reflect a process built for institutional convenience rather than patient empowerment. The form earns credit for easy findability, granular record selection, and proper handling of sensitive categories, but falls short on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness.

# Valleywise Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valleywise Health Medical Center, a government-owned independent community hospital in Phoenix, AZ, provides a notably patient-centered approach to medical records access. The organization maintains two distinct PDF forms: a general third-party authorization (Form 43439) and a dedicated patient access request form (Form 45643). This two-form architecture is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement, clearly separating patient self-access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Valleywise Health is among the organizations that get this right. Form 45643 — "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — is explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It does not require the patient to name a third-party recipient, does not include a purpose/reason field, and does not carry an expiration clause — all appropriate design choices for a one-time patient access request. Meanwhile, Form 43439 handles third-party disclosures with the appropriate authorization infrastructure (recipient designation, purpose selection, expiration, revocation rights). The organizational intent to differentiate is clear and well-executed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` returned direct PDF URLs. The organization's patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` also links to the forms. Both PDFs were publicly accessible from a standard WordPress media directory with no bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication. The descriptive filenames (e.g., `Form-45643-Patient-Request-For-Access-To-Protected-Health-Information_ENG_SPA.pdf`) make it clear which form is which.

## Form Document Quality

Form 45643 is a 2-page bilingual PDF (English page 1, full Spanish translation page 2). The layout is clean with a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection → date range → delivery format → recipient information → processing details → signature. The form offers an impressively granular record type selection with 16+ specific categories (discharge summary, H&P, nursing notes, operative reports, pathology, radiology, etc.) plus an "All Records" option. Delivery options include MyChart patient portal, paper copy, CD, USB, email, and fax.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a digitally-authored document. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the form's clean layout would translate well to interactive PDF fields. Submission is available via fax (602-655-9017) and email (ROI@valleywisehealth.org), providing adequate electronic pathways, but the print-and-handwrite step creates friction in an otherwise well-designed process.

The language is plain and accessible throughout, with clear instructions ("Please check (✔) the appropriate box(es) (❑) and fill in the blank(s) as needed") and a patient-friendly tone ("We appreciate your patience while we process your request").

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization, witness, or in-person requirements exist. The form states a HIPAA-compliant 30-day response timeline with a possible 30-day extension. Fee disclosure is vague — "Valleywise Health may charge a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing a fee schedule, though the language about "actual cost of the portable media" aligns with HIPAA's cost-based limits.

Two concerns stand out. First, the form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient access requests and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed or emailed. Second, the Spanish translation references "documento 43780" instead of the correct Form 43439, potentially sending Spanish-speaking patients searching for a nonexistent form.

## Notable Strengths

The standout features are the **full bilingual (English/Spanish) form** — not a summary but a complete parallel translation, appropriate for Phoenix's demographics — the **dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release, and the **granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control over their request scope. The email encryption transparency, defaulting to encryption with an informed opt-out, is a thoughtful touch.

## Overall Assessment

Valleywise Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its medical records access process. The dedicated patient access form, bilingual design, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options reflect genuine attention to the patient experience. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a paper-first completion workflow despite otherwise modern design sensibilities. The SSN field and Spanish-version cross-reference error are notable but secondary concerns. This is a well-designed system with room for straightforward technical improvements.

# CrescentCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CrescentCare is an independent nonprofit FQHC in New Orleans, Louisiana. The organization provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms — one in English (form-1.pdf) and one in Spanish (form-2.pdf) — for patients to request release of their medical information. Both are prominently linked from the Patient Resources and Downloads page. Notably, CrescentCare also maintains a dedicated "Request your medical records" page at `/records-request-form/` with an online submission option, providing a digital-first alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Assessment

CrescentCare uses a single generic HIPAA authorization form for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form is designed with patient self-access as a first-class use case: the "Myself via" option appears first in the recipient section, before the "Or to:" third-party option. This is a meaningful design choice that signals patient access is not an afterthought. The form offers three delivery methods for self-requests — Patient Portal, Encrypted Email, and Pick Up — with two of the three being electronic.

The organization goes further by offering a separate online records request page, giving patients who prefer a fully digital workflow an alternative to printing and mailing a PDF. This dual-pathway approach (PDF form plus online portal) is commendable for an FQHC.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding CrescentCare's forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's Patient Resources page prominently lists both language versions. No bot blocking, browser fallbacks, or creative search strategies were needed. The filenames are descriptive and language-tagged (`_en.pdf`, `_es.pdf`). Retrieval difficulty: Easy.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer. It follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient Information → Recipient → Information to Be Disclosed → Special Authorization for Sensitive Records → Purpose → Expiration → Patient Rights → Signature. The language is plain and accessible throughout; the patient rights section uses clear bullet points rather than dense legalese.

The form provides meaningful granularity with six record-type checkboxes plus an "Other" option, and appropriately gates sensitive records (behavioral health, substance use, HIV/AIDS) behind separate patient initials, consistent with Louisiana law and 42 CFR Part 2.

The primary weakness is that the PDF has zero fillable form fields despite being digitally authored. Patients must print, handwrite, and return the form — a notable gap for a document distributed online. Additionally, the form lacks submission instructions: no mailing address, fax number, or email address appears on the form itself, leaving patients uncertain how to return it.

## Barriers and Compliance

CrescentCare's form imposes no unnecessary barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement. The no-conditioning statement is explicit ("my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on my signing this authorization"). Revocation rights are clearly stated, though requiring a "signed letter" is a slightly higher bar than simply accepting any written request. No fees are mentioned on the form — this neither discourages patients nor sets expectations. No response timeframe is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Providing fully translated English and Spanish forms with identical structure is especially appropriate for New Orleans' diverse patient population.
- **Electronic delivery options**: Offering Patient Portal and Encrypted Email for self-requests is progressive — many organizations only offer mail or pickup.
- **Online records request page**: The dedicated `/records-request-form/` page provides a digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF workflow.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Fitting all necessary authorization elements on one well-organized page respects patient time.
- **Self-access prioritized**: Placing the "Myself via" option before third-party release on the form signals that patient access is a primary use case.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive form fields despite digital authoring — a missed opportunity for a form designed for online distribution.
- **No submission instructions**: The form gives patients no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **No fee or timeline disclosure**: Patients have no expectations about cost or turnaround time.

## Overall Assessment

CrescentCare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an FQHC. The combination of a well-designed bilingual authorization form, explicit patient self-access options, electronic delivery methods, and a separate online records request portal places it ahead of most peers. The main gaps — a non-fillable PDF and missing submission instructions — are common across the industry and prevent an excellent rating. Overall grade: B.

# NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) provides a well-organized, multi-channel records request system anchored by a system-wide "Tripartite" HIPAA authorization form shared across NYP, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medicine. Three documents were retrieved: the primary Tripartite ROI form (form-1), a patient-facing FAQ (form-2), and an older Lawrence campus-specific variant (form-3). The organization directs patients primarily to a Verisma online portal, with MyChart and paper form submission as alternatives.

## Access Pathway & Differentiation

NYP offers genuine differentiation at the pathway level: the medical records page provides separate Verisma portal links for Patient, Patient Representative, and Attorney workflows. This is a meaningful distinction that helps patients identify their correct route. However, the underlying authorization framework remains generic — the paper form (form-1) is a single HIPAA authorization used for all disclosure types, with "Patient Request" as one of seven checkboxes alongside Life Insurance, Legal Purposes, and Worker's Comp. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish the legal framework for patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization section states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records," which is accurate for third-party releases but misleading for patient access requests, where HIPAA requires only a written request, not a signed authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records) leads to a well-organized page. Web searches readily surface both the medical records page and direct PDF links. The form is hosted on a digital asset management platform (nyp.widen.net), which initially served an HTML viewer rather than the raw PDF, requiring some effort to extract the actual download URL. This is a minor friction point for an otherwise easy retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is technically excellent. It is a born-digital, fully interactive PDF with 103 fillable fields — one of the most technically capable ROI forms in this study. The 2-page form follows a logical flow through patient demographics, recipient information, disclosing entity selection (covering all 11 NYP campuses plus outpatient groups), granular record-type checkboxes (16+ options including "Entire Medical Record"), sensitive information authorization (compliant with New York state law for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing), six delivery methods, and a numbered authorization section. The layout is clean with bold section headers, though the density of content on two pages results in small text in places. The authorization language includes some compound legalese that is difficult to parse, but the overall organization is strong.

The form is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese — a notable accommodation for New York City's diverse population.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on the primary form (though the older Lawrence form-3 includes a "Witness or Notary" line). The Verisma portal requires two forms of photo ID, which exceeds typical HIPAA identity verification expectations and may exclude patients without two scannable photo IDs. The form mandates a date-of-service range, stating "records will not be released unless Date of Service section is complete" — a potential barrier for patients seeking their complete longitudinal record. Fees are described as "reasonable fees to recover costs," tracking HIPAA's statutory language without specifying amounts. No response time commitment appears on the form or FAQ.

## Notable Strengths

NYP's system stands out for its dedicated phone line (646-NYP-4ROI, M-F 8am-6pm), multilingual form availability, comprehensive FAQ document with transparent MyChart record-type listings, and the sheer technical quality of the fillable PDF. The six delivery options — paper, fax, email, CD, flash drive, and patient portal (at no cost) — give patients meaningful choice.

## Overall Assessment

NYP delivers a technically strong, well-organized records request experience with good findability and multiple access channels. The main weakness is the lack of a truly patient-access-specific pathway: despite portal-level differentiation, the underlying form treats patient self-access as one use case among many without acknowledging the distinct legal rights involved. The two-photo-ID portal requirement and mandatory date-of-service range create unnecessary friction. Overall, this is a solid B-level experience — above average in technical execution but falling short of patient-centered design.

# Vanderbilt University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Vanderbilt Health offers patients multiple pathways to request their medical records. The official medical records page at vanderbilthealth.com lists both downloadable PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish) and three online portals: a **Swellbox patient request portal**, a Swellbox provider request portal, and a ChartSwap third-party request portal. The separation of these portals by requester type — patient, provider, and third party — is a meaningful structural differentiator that many organizations lack.

Five PDF documents were discovered across Vanderbilt web properties. The current official English form is **form-4.pdf** (VMR 3017, dated 10/2023), a 2-page authorization linked from the main medical records page. Form-5 is its Spanish translation. Forms 1 and 2 are older versions (2022 and 2017 respectively) still publicly hosted on VUMC subdomains with no deprecation notice. Form-3 is an incoming-records form (release TO Vanderbilt) irrelevant to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Vanderbilt partially differentiates individual access from third-party release. At the portal level, the separation is clear: patients, providers, and third parties each have distinct Swellbox/ChartSwap entry points. However, at the PDF form level, Vanderbilt uses a single generic "Authorization for the Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — a HIPAA § 164.508 authorization form doing double duty for patient access requests that should technically fall under § 164.524 Right of Access. The form does correctly scope the purpose question in Section 8, noting it is only required "if not for your personal use," which recognizes patient self-access as the default. But the overall framing ("I hereby give Vanderbilt Health permission to disclose my individually identifiable protected health information") miscasts a patient right as a permission grant.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. The official vanderbilthealth.com medical records page clearly links both the English and Spanish PDFs under "Request Records by Authorization Form," and all downloads succeeded without bot blocking or login walls. The primary findability concern is that **outdated versions persist** on VUMC subdomains (student health, information privacy & security) — a patient searching Google could land on the 2017 or 2022 version, which has different fee structures, fewer facilities, and old branding, with no indication it's superseded.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4 is compact and well-organized, condensed from the older 4-page format to 2 pages with 10 numbered sections and clear bold headers. However, it is fundamentally an **image-only scan** — zero fillable fields, only 61 characters of extractable text, and no screen-reader accessibility. A patient must print it, complete it by hand, and submit via mail or fax. The electronic delivery option described in Section 4 (PDF through a request portal, directions sent to email) is a genuine patient-friendly feature. The fee schedule, while complex (6 scenarios), is transparently disclosed with all fees capped at $50 and a $6.50 flat rate for fully electronic delivery.

The form requests Last 4 SSN, which is more personal information than necessary. Section 9's acknowledgment section packs 11 bullet points of legal text in small font. The sensitive-information handling (Section 6) defaults to including psychiatric, substance use, and HIV information with an opt-out checkbox — permissible but puts the burden on the patient.

## Barriers and Strengths

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization or witness is required. Submission is possible via fax (adequate electronic pathway) and mail, plus the Swellbox portal provides a fully digital alternative. The 30-day response timeline is stated explicitly, and the form commits to no treatment conditioning. Fees are disclosed upfront and capped.

**Notable strengths** include: the Spanish-language version linked alongside the English form; the differentiated Swellbox patient portal as a digital alternative; the transparent and capped fee schedule; the correctly scoped purpose question; and the inclusion of an electronic delivery option via a request portal. The QR code on the form header may provide an additional pathway, though its destination isn't determinable from the PDF.

**Red flags** are the dual-purpose authorization framing, the persistence of outdated forms on subdomains, and the image-only scan format — surprising for a 2023 form from a major academic medical center that fails basic WCAG/Section 508 accessibility standards.

## Overall Assessment

Vanderbilt Health provides a **competent but imperfect** patient records request experience. The organization earns credit for offering differentiated digital pathways (Swellbox patient portal), a Spanish translation, transparent fees, and a well-organized 2-page form. It falls short on digital-first form design (image-only scan, no fillable fields) and conflates patient access rights with third-party authorization. The availability of the Swellbox portal as an alternative substantially mitigates the PDF's technical limitations, making this an organization that serves digitally-savvy patients reasonably well while leaving paper-dependent patients with an unnecessarily cumbersome experience.

# The Iowa Clinic — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

The Iowa Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in West Des Moines, Iowa. Notably, the organization has fully transitioned away from downloadable PDF authorization forms: all medical records requests are now handled through third-party online platforms. The two PDF forms evaluated (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf) were retrieved exclusively from the Wayback Machine and date from approximately 2012–2015. They are no longer available on the live website.

## Available Pathways and Current State

The Iowa Clinic's medical records page (https://www.iowaclinic.com/for-patients/payment-billing/medical-records/) routes patients through four distinct channels depending on who is requesting records:

1. **Patient self-requests**: Datavant/Swellbox Health Record Wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/iowa-clinic-wizard.html) — an online portal for patients to request their own records.
2. **Imaging records**: A Formstack-powered web form on the Iowa Clinic website.
3. **Healthcare providers**: A separate Swellbox wizard.
4. **Third-party organizations**: SmartRequest portal (https://smartrequest.com).

This multi-channel architecture is the most relevant finding: The Iowa Clinic **does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release** at the website level, routing patients to a dedicated Swellbox wizard while directing third-party organizations to a separate SmartRequest portal. This structural separation is a meaningful strength.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page itself was straightforward — it's accessible under For Patients > Payment & Billing > Medical Records. However, finding downloadable PDF forms required significant effort since none exist on the current site. The PDFs were only recoverable through Wayback Machine archive searches of defunct URLs (`/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf` and `/static/docs/medical-records-release-form.pdf`). No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Historical Form Quality (form-1.pdf — Primary Evaluated Form)

Form-1.pdf is the newer of the two historical forms — a single-page "Authorization for Release of Information" with a clean digital layout (not a scan), text layer present, but **zero fillable fields**. It would require printing and handwriting. The form has approximately 15 fields including patient demographics, record-type checkboxes (8 options), destination address, purpose of release (6 options plus "Other"), sensitive-information opt-out initials, and signature. The layout follows a logical flow and fits everything on one page without excessive cramming.

The language is a mix of plain and semi-legal. Disclosure paragraphs are readable but contain some dense constructions. The form includes a "Request by patient" purpose option, which is a bright spot — acknowledging patient-initiated access even within a form designed primarily for third-party release. Submission was by fax (515-875-9600) or mail only.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection**: Both forms request Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The electronic transmission clause shifts all liability for misdirected fax/email to the patient, which is an overreach.
- **Fees**: The forms mention a "cost-based fee" without specifying amounts — compliant language but leaves patients unable to anticipate costs.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax and mail were offered as submission methods on the historical forms; the current online portal eliminates even these steps.

## Notable Strengths

The Iowa Clinic's most significant strength is its forward-looking transition to a fully digital, portal-based workflow. By routing patient requests through Swellbox/Datavant — a purpose-built health records request platform — the organization has eliminated the print-fill-fax cycle entirely for patients with internet access. The website's clear separation of patient requests from third-party requests demonstrates awareness of the distinction between individual access rights and authorization-based release.

## Overall Assessment

The Iowa Clinic presents a bifurcated picture. Its **current state** is strong: the organization has modernized beyond PDF forms to online portals with clear pathway differentiation. However, the **historical forms** we could directly evaluate were generic ROI authorization forms with no fillable fields, SSN collection, and liability waivers. Scoring reflects the best available current pathway (the Swellbox portal) while noting that the only downloadable form documents available for detailed quality assessment are from 2012–2015 and no longer represent the patient experience. For a patient requesting their own records today, The Iowa Clinic offers a patient-centered, digitally accessible process.
