# Document Quality Deep Dive — Batch 21

## Batch Composition

This batch spans 8 organizations across 6 states: 2 FQHCs (Philadelphia FIGHT, Cherokee Health Systems), 3 community hospitals (Advocate Good Samaritan, Lakeland Regional Health, Hillcrest Claremore), 1 teaching hospital (UAB Hospital), 1 critical access hospital (Copley Hospital), and 1 small community hospital (Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital). The mix includes independent facilities and system-affiliated sites, nonprofits and one for-profit, with bed counts ranging from 25 (Copley) to 1,207 (UAB).

## Fillability: The Dominant Gap

**Only 1 of 8 organizations (12.5%) offers a fillable/interactive PDF** for its primary patient access form. UAB Hospital's form-1 stands alone with 51 interactive form fields — dropdown menus, text entry boxes, and checkboxes that patients can complete digitally. The remaining 7 organizations all present flat, print-and-fill PDFs with zero interactive fields, despite every single form being digitally authored (not scanned). No image-only scans appeared in this batch.

This is the batch's most striking finding: these are born-digital documents that could trivially have been made fillable but weren't. Cherokee Health Systems' form was updated in December 2025 yet still lacks fillable fields. Advocate Good Samaritan's form uses 8 embedded fonts and clean vector graphics but forces handwriting. The gap between digital authoring capability and actual interactivity is universal.

## Page Counts and Field Counts

Page counts are compact: **5 forms are single-page, 3 are two-page**. No form exceeds 2 pages. Field count estimates range from **10 (Advocate Good Samaritan) to 51 (UAB Hospital)**, with a median around 17. UAB's high field count reflects its five-tier graduated record package system and granular record-type checkboxes — a feature-rich design rather than unnecessary bloat. The single-page forms (Philadelphia FIGHT, Cherokee, Advocate, Lakeland, Copley) manage to fit patient demographics, record type selection, delivery options, and signature blocks into one page — a design achievement that reduces patient burden.

## Digital-First vs. Scanned

**All 8 forms (100%) are digital-first** — created in document editors with clean text layers, embedded fonts, and vector graphics. None are scanned paper forms. This is a positive finding: the era of photocopied, fax-artifact ROI forms may be receding, at least among the facility types represented here. However, "digital-first" authoring has not translated into digital-first *usage*: without fillable fields, 7 of 8 forms still require a print → handwrite → scan/fax workflow that negates their digital origins.

## Layout, Typography, and Visual Design

Layout quality is consistently adequate to good. **All 8 forms have clear layouts** per their structured scoring. Common design patterns include:

- **Logical section flow**: Patient demographics → record scope → delivery method → legal disclosures → signature (universal pattern)
- **Checkbox-based record selection**: Most forms offer 10–22 record-type checkboxes, giving patients granular control
- **Single-column layouts** dominate, though Advocate Good Samaritan uses an effective three-column organization for record types

Typography ranges from clean and professional (UAB, Goleta Valley, Advocate) to adequate but unremarkable (Copley, Lakeland). One notable accessibility issue: Hillcrest Claremore's form uses font mappings that cause checkbox characters to extract as Khmer script (U+17A2), breaking screen readers and assistive technology.

## Instructions

**5 of 8 organizations (62.5%) include some form of instructions**, though quality varies widely. Cherokee Health Systems' color-coded instructional companion guides — separate documents with annotated overlays explaining each form section in plain language, available in both English and Spanish — represent the gold standard in this batch. UAB Hospital's form includes a rights-affirming opening statement and contextual section labels. Philadelphia FIGHT front-loads legal information in dense introductory prose.

Three organizations (Lakeland, Hillcrest, Copley) provide no instructions at all. Hillcrest's form notably omits even submission instructions — no mailing address, fax number, or email, leaving patients to independently determine where to send completed forms.

## Multilingual Support

**3 of 8 organizations (37.5%) offer multilingual forms**: Philadelphia FIGHT and Cherokee Health Systems provide Spanish translations, and Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital maintains a professionally translated Spanish form (NS1406). Notably, Advocate Good Samaritan offers a Spanish-language form but only for the third-party authorization — not for the dedicated patient self-access form, creating a language-access gap for the form that matters most.

## Notable Examples

**Best craftsmanship — UAB Hospital**: The only fillable PDF in the batch, with 51 interactive fields, a five-tier record package system giving patients graduated scope control, a rights-affirming opening statement, and comprehensive delivery options including encrypted email. This is what a well-crafted patient access form looks like.

**Most thoughtful accessibility — Cherokee Health Systems**: The bilingual instructional companion guides with color-coded annotations are exceptional. While the form itself lacks fillable fields, the paired approach — plain form plus visual guide — demonstrates genuine investment in patient comprehension.

**Most notable gap — Hillcrest Claremore**: A system-affiliated form with zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, broken font mappings for accessibility tools, and a bundled liability waiver. The form is a vestige of carbon-copy paper workflows (duplicated pages for facility and patient copies). The saving grace is that digital alternatives (MyChart, Swellbox) exist alongside it.

## Summary

The dominant pattern in this batch is **digital authoring without digital functionality**. Every form is born-digital, yet 87.5% force a paper workflow. Layout and organization are generally competent. Multilingual support exists but is inconsistent. The gap between the best (UAB's 51-field interactive form) and the rest is stark — and it's not a function of organizational size or resources, since even the most recently updated forms in 2025 fail to include basic fillable fields.
