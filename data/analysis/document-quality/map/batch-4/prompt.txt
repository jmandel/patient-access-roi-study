# HopeHealth (Florence, SC) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

HopeHealth is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Florence, South Carolina. The organization has fully outsourced its medical records release process to HealthMark Group, a third-party vendor. No HopeHealth-branded ROI or authorization form exists as a publicly downloadable document. Instead, the organization's medical records page directs patients exclusively to HealthMark's online Request Manager portal.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved during the evaluation:

1. **form-1.pdf** — HopeHealth's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP). This is an informational document, not an authorization or request form. It mentions patients' right to access records but provides no actionable mechanism beyond directing them to the Privacy Officer's contact information.

2. **form-2.pdf** — A generic HealthMark Group Medical Records Release Authorization form. This was found on HealthMark's parent company website (hmutx.com), *not* on HopeHealth's website. It is unbranded and could apply to any HealthMark client facility.

The **primary pathway** for a patient is the HealthMark Request Manager online portal, linked from HopeHealth's medical records page at `https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/`. This portal requires email verification to initiate a request.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

HopeHealth does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The generic HealthMark form lists "Patient Request" as one of six purposes alongside Attorney, Insurance, Disability, and Referring Physician — treating patient access as a flavor of general disclosure rather than a distinct legal right under HIPAA § 164.524. The form cites § 164.508 (authorization for disclosure) throughout, which is the wrong legal framework for individual right-of-access requests. It is unknown whether the HealthMark portal differentiates these pathways internally, as the portal could not be accessed without email verification.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was **hard**. Extensive web searches, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine checks, and HTML source inspection failed to locate any HopeHealth-specific authorization form. Search results were complicated by name confusion with Hope Health Ellis County, TX (a different organization). The HealthMark portal is gated behind email verification, making it impossible to evaluate the actual request workflow or any forms within it. The Wayback Machine confirmed this portal-only approach has been consistent since at least 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The generic HealthMark form (form-2.pdf) is a digitally-created single-page PDF but has **no fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite or use annotation tools. It contains approximately 15 data fields and 11 record-type checkboxes. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (recipient → patient → dates → records → purpose → acknowledgments → signature), but the content is dense, with inline CFR citations and legal language that would challenge many patients. There are no instructions for completion, no statement of patient rights, and no options for how records should be delivered.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are not disclosed anywhere — neither on the form, the NPP, nor the medical records page. The generic form imposes a fixed 180-day expiration on the authorization, which would not apply to a § 164.524 access request. The NPP contains a notable typo: the Privacy Officer's email is listed as `HIPPA@hope-health.org` (misspelling HIPAA), which could undermine patient confidence and cause email delivery issues.

## Strengths

The decision to outsource to an online portal (HealthMark Group) is conceptually a strength — it provides a digital pathway that avoids requiring patients to download, print, and mail forms. The NPP, while dense, includes concrete patient-friendly examples of permitted uses and addresses substance use disorder protections. The generic form offers granular record-type selection with 11 categories.

## Overall Assessment

HopeHealth's approach is a mixed bag. The online portal represents a modern, potentially patient-friendly pathway, but the organization provides no transparency about what that portal experience entails. There is no downloadable form for patients who prefer a traditional approach, no fee disclosure, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The available documentation (NPP and generic form) has quality issues including dense legalese, wrong HIPAA citations, and a notable typo. A patient navigating this system would find their way to the portal with moderate effort but would encounter opacity about the process, fees, and timeline.

# Penobscot Community Health Care — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Bangor, Maine. Two PDF forms were found, but they are identical documents hosted at different WordPress upload paths (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf share the same text, revision date, and form code MRC001). The organization's primary records request pathway is a third-party Datavant/Swellbox online portal, linked from the Health Information Management page. The PDF authorization form exists on the server but is not linked from any patient-facing page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

PCHC does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. The sole PDF form is titled "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" and covers both disclosing records TO a third party and obtaining records FROM a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the same form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties — including naming themselves as the recipient and navigating redisclosure warnings that don't apply to self-access. The purpose checkbox "At my request" is available but does not clearly distinguish individual access rights from authorized third-party release.

The Datavant/Swellbox portal (https://www.swellbox.com/pchc-wizard.html) is the pathway the organization actively directs patients toward from its website. While this provides a digital alternative, the PDF form — the only org-created document available for evaluation — remains a generic HIPAA authorization with no patient access specialization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted Google search (`filetype:pdf` query); it was **not discoverable** through normal website navigation. The HIM page (https://pchc.com/healthinformation/) links to the Datavant portal and a Privacy Practices Booklet, but not the authorization form PDF. Two identical copies at different URLs (`/2024/03/` and `/2021/11/` paths) create version-control confusion. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. Difficulty: moderate — the portal is findable from the website, but the PDF form is effectively hidden.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive fields) across 2 pages. Patients must print it, handwrite all entries, and submit physically. Despite the non-fillable format, the document itself is well-structured with clear, labeled sections progressing logically: patient identification → authorization direction → recipient details → delivery method → record types → sensitive information → purpose → duration → rights acknowledgments → signature. Approximately 18 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology. Core instructions ("To DISCLOSE my health information below TO:") are clear with helpful capitalization for emphasis, but several sections use dense legal prose. The "continuing communications" clause and opt-out-by-striking mechanisms are particularly confusing — patients must physically strike out text to limit scope, and failure to do so defaults to the broadest possible authorization, including ongoing disclosure of future encounters.

Record type granularity is good, offering seven specific categories plus an open-ended option, with date-range filtering. Four delivery methods are available: mail (defaulting to CD), fax, email via secure portal, and verbal communication.

## Barriers and Compliance

No fees are disclosed — neither excessive charges nor explicit statements of no-fee patient access. No notarization or witness is required. The form does not specify submission instructions, though PCHC's fax number (207-990-1248), mailing address, and email (PCHCMR@pchc.com) are provided in the header, implying fax and mail submission are available.

Compliance elements are generally sound: oral revocation is permitted, the non-conditioning statement is present, 42 CFR Part 2 redisclosure notice is properly included, and sensitive information categories require affirmative opt-in. However, the form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or reference the patient's right of access. The office-use section includes an unusual and commendable accountability checkbox requiring staff to flag partial or incomplete disclosures.

## Bright Spots

- **Secure email delivery** via PCHC's portal (records sent as PDFs accessible through a secure messaging system)
- **Oral revocation** permitted — more accessible than written-only requirements
- **Partial disclosure transparency** — internal checkbox requiring notification when records provided are incomplete
- **Datavant/Swellbox portal** provides an alternative digital pathway beyond the paper form

## Red Flags

- **PDF form is unlinkable from the website** — HIM page directs exclusively to Datavant, making the org's own form effectively hidden
- **Opt-out-by-striking defaults** to broadest possible authorization for continuing communications and third-party-received records
- **CD as default mail delivery** medium — outdated and likely unusable for many patients

## Overall Assessment

PCHC provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The organization deserves credit for offering a Datavant portal as a digital pathway and for several thoughtful compliance provisions. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access form, the non-fillable PDF, the hidden form URL, and the confusing opt-out defaults limit patient-centeredness. A patient navigating PCHC's website would be funneled to the Datavant portal — a workable option — but would struggle to find or use the organization's own authorization form independently.

# MountainView Hospital (Las Vegas, NV) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MountainView Hospital is part of HCA Healthcare's Sunrise Health network in Las Vegas. The facility's own domain (`mountainview-hospital.com`) redirects to the Sunrise Health system website at `sunrisehealthinfo.com`, where all medical records information is centralized. Two PDF forms were found—an English and Spanish version of the same standardized HCA Healthcare authorization form—alongside references to two additional digital pathways: an online Swellbox records request portal and the MyHealthONE patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The medical records page at sunrisehealthinfo.com offers three pathways for patients requesting records: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (in English and Spanish), (2) an online request wizard via Swellbox, and (3) the MyHealthONE patient portal. The primary downloadable form (form-1.pdf, HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21) is a system-wide HCA Healthcare standardized authorization used across all HCA facilities, not specific to MountainView Hospital. The Swellbox portal represents the most streamlined digital option, though the PDF form remains the most prominently linked resource.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MountainView Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves both patient self-requests and third-party release, with a radio-button choice between "At the request of the individual" and "Other 3rd party recipient." While a patient *can* use this form to request their own records, the form's framing—with prominent "Recipient" fields, fax-to-provider-only restrictions, and third-party disclosure language—is clearly oriented toward release-of-information scenarios rather than individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. The form makes no distinction between Right of Access fee limits/timelines and general authorization practices.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was relatively easy. The medical records page is accessible via the main navigation ("For Patients → Medical Records"), and the authorization forms are directly linked with clear labels. The one complication was bot protection: curl requests to the initial download URL returned HTML rather than a PDF, requiring discovery of the actual CDN URL at `hcadam.com`. This is a minor technical obstacle that wouldn't affect a patient using a browser.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a single-page, fully interactive PDF with 52 fillable fields—patients can complete it digitally without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (patient/recipient info, marketing/PHI sale, signatures), with 16 specific record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. Four delivery format options are offered: paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure). The form also includes a rare USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release option, a forward-looking feature for structured data export.

However, the single-page constraint makes the layout quite dense, and some terminology (USCDI, Direct Address, NPI) is jargon that would be opaque to most patients. The language is a mix of plain language and legalese—the six "I understand that..." statements are reasonably clear, but the overall form assumes familiarity with medical records processes.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked optional but unnecessary for records authorization and a data minimization concern.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form states patients may obtain copies "for a reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts, and this language appears in a rights statement that could normalize fee collection even for Right of Access requests.
- **Fax restriction**: "(FAX only to Physician Office / Medical facility)" limits fax delivery destinations and may restrict patient choice.
- **No notarization or witness required**—a positive.
- **No in-person requirement**: Mail, fax, and online portal options are all available.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual**: Full Spanish translation (form-2.pdf) available alongside the English version—meaningful for Las Vegas's significant Spanish-speaking population, though the surrounding web pages remain English-only and some form footer elements were left untranslated.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare and forward-looking inclusion of interoperability standards on an ROI form.
- **Multiple electronic delivery choices**: Four format options with honest risk disclosures.
- **Alternative digital pathways**: Swellbox portal and MyHealthONE patient portal provide additional request channels beyond the PDF.
- **52 fillable fields**: Fully digital-first form design.

## Overall Assessment

MountainView Hospital, through HCA Healthcare's standardized forms and Sunrise Health's website, provides a reasonably accessible records request experience. The form is easy to find, technically well-built, and offers meaningful delivery format choices. The main weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway—patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization form that doesn't distinguish Right of Access rights, fee limits, or timelines. The availability of the Swellbox online portal and MyHealthONE partially compensates for this gap by offering alternative digital pathways. The form earns credit for its fillable design, Spanish availability, and USCDI awareness, but loses points for its generic framing, fee ambiguity, and unnecessary SSN collection.

# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore is part of the Hillcrest HealthCare System (Ardent Health Services), and all medical records requests are handled through the parent system's centralized infrastructure. Two PDFs were downloaded during research, but only one is relevant: **form-2.pdf** is the system-wide "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (HMC1072, Rev. 08/18), which lists Hillcrest Hospital Claremore among nine facilities via checkboxes. Form-1.pdf belongs to an entirely unrelated practice — Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego, CA — and was a false-positive search result retained per study protocol.

Beyond the paper form, the system's Medical Records Request page advertises two digital pathways: **MyChart** (patient portal) and a **Swellbox** online request wizard (hosted at swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html). The paper form is thus the weakest of three available channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** clearly differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The paper form is a generic HIPAA authorization covering both disclosure *to* and receipt *from* third parties in a single document. It includes "At the request of the patient or patient's representative" as one purpose checkbox among Insurance, Continued treatment, Legal, and Other — framing patient access as merely one use case rather than a distinct right. The form makes no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

However, the availability of the Swellbox online wizard suggests the system may have a more patient-centric digital pathway. The paper form alone is clearly designed for the traditional release-of-information workflow, not individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search led directly to the system-wide Medical Records Request page at hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/, reachable in 2–3 clicks from the main website. The page clearly presents multiple pathways (MyChart, Swellbox, paper form). One minor friction point: direct searches for "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" specifically did not surface the form — a patient must navigate through or discover the parent system's centralized page.

## Form Document Quality

The paper form (form-2.pdf) is a **digitally created PDF with zero fillable fields**, forcing patients to print and handwrite all entries. This is a missed opportunity — the form was created digitally but not made interactive. The document is effectively one page of content duplicated as a carbon-copy format (page 1 for the facility, page 2 for the patient), a vestige of physical paper workflows.

The layout follows a logical flow: facility selection → patient identification → authorization body → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. However, the "I understand" section is a dense block of legalistic text with minimal visual separation. Record type options are clinically specific (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, etc.) with no "all records" or "entire medical record" checkbox. The checkbox characters extract as Khmer script (U+17A2), indicating a font-mapping issue that breaks assistive technology.

The language is **moderately legalistic**, particularly the sensitive-information acknowledgment paragraph, which is a single run-on sentence listing communicable diseases.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release the entities listed above, their agents and employees from any liability" as a condition of authorizing disclosure — not required by HIPAA and a red flag.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Normal applicable fees, such as copy fees, may apply" with no schedule or estimate.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no mailing address, fax number, or other submission method — patients must figure out delivery independently.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Patients cannot authorize general records release while excluding mental health, HIV, or substance abuse information.
- **No notarization** or witness requirement — a positive.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple request pathways**: The system offers MyChart, Swellbox online wizard, and a paper form — patients have choices.
- **System-wide form clarity**: The facility checkbox design clearly identifies which entities are covered, preventing confusion about facility-specific forms.
- **Easy findability**: The centralized Medical Records Request page is well-organized and accessible.

## Overall Assessment

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore benefits from its parent system's multi-channel approach to records requests, with digital options (MyChart and Swellbox) supplementing the paper form. However, the paper form itself — the only downloadable document — is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, legalistic language, and a problematic liability waiver. The organization earns credit for pathway availability and findability, but the form document quality and lack of patient access differentiation hold it back. A patient who only finds the paper form faces a distinctly paper-era experience; a patient who discovers the online pathways has a better route. Overall: **adequate infrastructure, mediocre form document, no patient-access differentiation**.

# Phelps Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Memorial Health Center is a small independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Holdrege, Nebraska. The organization offers a single ROI form — a one-page "Request for Release of Information" — that serves as the sole documented pathway for patients requesting their medical records. No patient portal–based request option, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway

Phelps Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization used for all purposes — releasing records to another provider, to a third party, or to the patient themselves. "Patient" appears as one of three checkbox options under "Release Records To" (alongside "Provider/Hospital" and "Other Person"), and an in-person inspection option is included, but there is no dedicated workflow or separate form for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as an attorney or insurer, selecting the applicable checkboxes and ignoring fields meant for third-party recipients.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was **easy to find via web search** — a basic query for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned a direct link to the PDF. However, the form is **not linked from the organization's patient forms page**, which only lists a Patient History Form and New Patient Form. A patient browsing the website through normal navigation would not discover the ROI form. The PDF is hosted at a raw Drupal file path with no landing page or contextual instructions.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but with zero interactive form fields. All blanks are underscored lines intended for handwriting. The form must be printed, filled out by hand, and returned via fax (two fax numbers are listed in the footer) or in person. No electronic fill-and-submit workflow exists.

**Layout and organization** are logical — the form flows top-to-bottom from patient identification through record source, recipient, purpose, record type selection, legal language, and signature. However, the single page is moderately cramped, and administrative fields ("Release completed by:", "MR #:") appear prominently at the top, potentially confusing patients who may think they need to fill them in.

**Language** is mixed: the top half uses plain, accessible phrasing with straightforward checkboxes, while the bottom half presents dense legal paragraphs covering HIPAA rights, revocation, treatment conditioning, and sensitive information disclosures. The legal text includes a factual error — citing "Health Information Portability and Accountability Act" instead of the correct "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no unreasonable barriers**: no notarization or witness required, no in-person-only submission (fax is available), and appropriate anti-conditioning language is included with a specific HIPAA citation (§ 164.508). Fee disclosure is transparent and reasonable — first 10 pages are free, $0.25/page thereafter, $10 for CD — which is more generous than many providers. The form also includes a "COMPLETE HEALTH RECORD" checkbox, simplifying requests for patients who want everything.

Concerns include the **calendar-year expiration** ("Release effective until the end of this year"), which creates an inconsistent authorization window depending on when the patient signs. The form is dated August 2017 and has not been updated in over eight years, raising questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **First 10 pages free**: Reduces cost burden for routine patient access requests.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Accomplishes a complete ROI authorization concisely.
- **"Complete Health Record" option**: Lets patients request everything without needing to select individual categories.
- **Anti-conditioning language**: Explicitly states treatment cannot be conditioned on signing.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields**: Entirely print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Not linked from website navigation**: Findable only via search engine.
- **Generic form for all purposes**: No differentiation for patient self-access.
- **HIPAA name error and outdated form**: Suggests lack of recent legal review.
- **Staff fields on patient-facing form**: "Release completed by" and "MR #" may confuse patients.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Memorial Health Center provides a functional but basic records request process. The single-page form is efficient and the fee structure is patient-friendly, but the lack of fillable fields, absence from website navigation, and failure to distinguish patient access from third-party release place this organization squarely in the middle tier. The form gets the job done but reflects a paper-era workflow that has not been updated to serve the modern patient experience. **Grade: C.**

# Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center provides two distinct PDF forms for health information requests, both accessible from a centralized, facility-specific medical records page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/medical-records-wa/sacred-heart`:

1. **Form 1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" — a general third-party authorization form for disclosing records to an external recipient (insurer, attorney, another provider, etc.). 2 pages, 37 fillable fields.
2. **Form 2** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — a dedicated patient access form for individuals requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). 2 pages, 45 fillable fields.

The facility also offers Spanish versions of both forms, plus additional forms for amendments, accounting of disclosures, restriction/revocation, and Health Information Exchange opt-out — a comprehensive suite rarely seen at individual facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release. The dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" form uses correct HIPAA terminology and is purpose-built for patients requesting their own records. This separation is a significant strength — many organizations force patients through a single generic authorization form regardless of whether they want their own records or are authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was effortless. A single web search returned direct links to the facility-specific medical records page. The page is cleanly organized, with clearly labeled PDF download links and no bot blocking, login walls, or portal gatekeeping. URL naming is descriptive (`wa-sacred-heart-access-designated-record-set.pdf`), and the page is reachable through Providence's main navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form 2 — Primary Patient Access Form)

Form 2 is a natively digital 2-page PDF with 45 interactive fillable fields — checkboxes for record types, delivery formats, and text fields for demographics and date ranges. The form is not an image scan. Page 1 provides instructional text and institutional notices; page 2 contains the input fields. The layout is clean and logically organized.

Five delivery format options are offered: MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, and Fax. The MyChart integration is particularly strong, meeting patients where they likely already have an account. Patients can select specific record types, date ranges, and facilities. A "Last 2 years only" convenience checkbox is a practical touch.

The language is reasonably plain, though it includes some boilerplate legal text. The form includes multilingual language assistance notices (English, Spanish, Chinese) with a toll-free phone number and TTY access. Spanish versions of both forms are separately available.

## Barriers

**Signature**: Both forms require a wet signature ("Print form and sign by hand"), which prevents fully digital completion despite the otherwise comprehensive fillable fields. This is the single most significant barrier.

**Fees**: Form 2 states "Fees may be associated with this request" without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based fee standard. Patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by fax ((509) 474-4815), email (PSHMC.HIMRecords@Providence.org), or mail — multiple remote submission options are available, so in-person delivery is not required.

**No notarization** is required. **No response time** is stated.

## Red Flags and Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The patient access form (form 2) includes a liability release clause typically found on third-party authorization forms, which is inappropriate for a patient exercising their Right of Access. The form also lacks any explicit statement of patient rights (right to receive records, 30-day response timeline, right to appeal denial).

**Bright spots**: The dedicated patient access form, five delivery formats including MyChart, multi-facility awareness ("we would be glad to fax a copy of this form to other facilities"), the centralized portal with Spanish translations, and the proactive SSN disclosure warning on form 1 all demonstrate above-average patient-centeredness.

## Overall Assessment

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center offers one of the better patient access experiences among community hospitals. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, five electronic delivery options, and an exceptionally well-organized web portal demonstrate genuine investment in patient-centered records access. The wet signature requirement and vague fee language are the main drawbacks, preventing a top-tier score. The organization earns a strong B overall — clearly above average, with room for improvement in digital workflow completion and rights transparency.

# Barrett Hospital & HealthCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Barrett Hospital & HealthCare is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Dillon, Montana. The organization offers a single pathway for patients requesting their medical records: a one-page PDF authorization form linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page on its Wix-hosted website. Only one form was found during the retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Barrett Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole form — titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios, including inter-provider transfers, third-party releases, and patient access. The form includes dual "RECEIVE from" / "RELEASE to" fields, a compensation disclosure clause, and language about conditioning treatment on signing — elements that are appropriate for third-party authorizations but inappropriate and potentially confusing when a patient is simply exercising their HIPAA right of access under § 164.524. There is no mention of patient access rights anywhere on the form.

The "Purpose" field does include "Personal Use" as a circled option, which is the closest the form comes to acknowledging patient self-access. However, this is a single option among several on a general-purpose form, not a dedicated pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search quickly identified the "Request Medical Records" page, which features a clearly labeled download link. For a small rural critical access hospital, this level of web accessibility is commendable — many larger organizations make their forms harder to find. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **natively digital PDF but not fillable** — it has zero interactive form fields. Patients must print, handwrite their responses on blank lines, and return the form via fax, mail, or in-person pickup. The "circle one" instructions for format and delivery options confirm the print-and-handwrite design intent.

Despite the non-fillable limitation, the form is well-organized and concise at a single page. It follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → date ranges → format/delivery → legal notices → signature. The record-type section uses an efficient tabular layout with per-category date ranges. The turnaround time ("10 days") is stated prominently at the top — a practice many organizations neglect entirely.

The language is mostly plain, though the legal paragraphs at the bottom are denser. The "Initial" column in the record-type table is ambiguous — patients are apparently expected to initial next to each record type they want, but this is never explained. The abbreviation "Disc" next to imaging options is also cryptic.

The form collects last four digits of SSN, which is unnecessary under HIPAA for identity verification and may deter some patients. Delivery options include pick up, fax, and mail — fax qualifies as an electronic submission pathway per our scoring baseline, so the organization meets the minimum for remote submission.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant compliance issue is the conditioning language: "I understand that I may refuse this authorization and that my refusal to sign may affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment or my eligibility for benefits." Under HIPAA § 164.524, providers cannot condition treatment on a patient's willingness to authorize access to their own records. Because this dual-purpose form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release, this problematic language is presented to all requestors regardless of context.

The compensation disclosure clause ("I understand that _____ will receive compensation for its use/disclosure of the information") is similarly irrelevant for patient access requests and adds confusion. No fee schedule is disclosed on the form or the website's medical records page.

## Strengths

- **Easy findability** with a dedicated medical records page and clear download link
- **Concise single-page design** that reduces patient burden
- **Stated turnaround time** of 10 days sets clear expectations
- **Fax submission available**, providing a remote electronic pathway
- **42 CFR Part 2 and redisclosure notices** are properly included

## Overall Assessment

Barrett Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of small independent hospitals. The form is easy to find, reasonably organized, and concise, but it is a generic third-party authorization form repurposed for all disclosure purposes — including patient self-access — without any differentiation. The non-fillable PDF and conditioning language are the most notable shortcomings. For a critical access hospital with limited resources, the web presence and form accessibility are respectable, but the organization misses the mark on patient-centeredness by failing to treat individual access as distinct from third-party release.

# Michigan Medicine – University of Michigan Health: Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Michigan Medicine provides three publicly available forms related to medical records, though only one is relevant for patient self-access. **Form-1** (70-10015, VER: A/24) is the current "Authorization to Release Copies of a Medical Record," a 3-page document that serves as the primary ROI form for both patient self-requests and third-party releases. **Form-2** is an outdated 2011 version of the same form, still indexed on the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain — a housekeeping gap that could confuse patients. **Form-3** is an inbound records request form (authorizing Michigan Medicine to pull records from other providers), unrelated to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves dual purposes, but it does meaningfully differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Item 2 provides a dedicated "Myself" checkbox with delivery options tailored to patients (Patient Portal, electronic email web link, US Mail), while item 3 handles third-party recipients with its own delivery methods. This structural separation gives patients a clear path without needing to decode which sections apply to them. Additionally, the form prominently promotes the **MyUofMHealth Patient Portal** as a free, zero-cost delivery channel — a strong nudge toward the most convenient option. However, the form remains fundamentally an authorization rather than a dedicated patient access request, and the fee schedule and prepayment language do not clearly exempt patient self-requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search for Michigan Medicine's ROI form immediately returned direct links to the current PDF on `uofmhealth.org`. No site navigation was required. The download was unobstructed — no CAPTCHAs or bot blocking on the primary domain (though the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain had Cloudflare challenges). The one annoyance is the uninformative filename (`ROI_.pdf`).

## Form Document Quality

The form has a proper text layer and clean digital design — it is not a scan. However, despite the full text layer, **no fillable/interactive PDF fields exist** (metadata confirms `fillable_field_count: 0`). A patient must print and handwrite or use a PDF annotation tool. For submission, fax (734-936-8571) and mail are available; notably, **no walk-in services** are offered — a departure from the 2011 version which accepted in-person delivery at any registration desk.

The layout uses numbered sections (1–9) that follow a logical progression: voluntariness statement → patient info → self/third-party selection → purpose → record set → expiration → revocation → signature → fees. The **package-based record selection** system is a genuine bright spot: instead of requiring patients to specify individual record types, it offers pre-built packages (Package 1: Key Clinical Documentation; Package 2: All Clinical Documentation) mapped to common purposes. This simplifies what is typically one of the most confusing parts of any ROI form.

Language is bureaucratic but generally comprehensible. Legal disclosures (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure risks) are clearly stated. Some passages are dense, particularly the insurance authorization exception clause. The fee schedule on page 3 is presented as a clear table with a helpful "No Cost Services" sidebar.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are disclosed transparently: portal access is free, electronic delivery to patients costs $6.89, and third-party requests incur higher per-page fees. The $6.89 patient fee is close to HIPAA's cost-based guidance but not explicitly justified as cost-based. More concerning is the prepayment language — "Some records requested for legal, insurance, or personal use may require a prepayment" — where "personal use" could be read to include patient self-requests, potentially conflicting with HIPAA's prohibition on conditioning access on payment.

The authorization defaults to a 60-day expiration, which is relatively short given the stated turnaround of 5–7 business days (with a caveat to "allow up to 30 days"). Turnaround time discrepancies between pages 2 and 3 add confusion. The form also names **Vital Chart (VRC)** as the third-party vendor handling records fulfillment — a transparency bright spot that sets patient expectations for communications from an unfamiliar sender.

## Overall Assessment

Michigan Medicine provides a competent, moderately patient-centered records request process. The form is well-organized, the package system simplifies record selection, and the portal promotion guides patients toward a free pathway. However, the lack of fillable PDF fields, the ambiguous prepayment language, and the elimination of walk-in services create friction. The continued availability of the outdated 2011 form is a minor but avoidable risk. This is a solid B-level experience: functional and accessible, with room for improvement in digital form design and compliance clarity.

# Barnes-Jewish Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJC HealthCare system) provides two distinct PDF forms on its Medical Records Requests page. **Form-1** is a dedicated patient access form titled "REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION BY INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS," designed exclusively for patients requesting their own records. **Form-2** is a general "Authorization For Release Of Information" form for third-party disclosures — attorneys, insurers, other providers. The website clearly separates these use cases, also listing links for next-of-kin requests, amendment requests, and Care Everywhere revocation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

This is where Barnes-Jewish stands out. Having a **dedicated patient self-access form** distinct from the third-party authorization is a genuine best practice that few organizations implement. The website's Medical Records Requests page explicitly categorizes "Individual requests" separately from "Third-party requests," so a patient arriving at the page sees an unambiguous path to the right form. The patient access form (revised 05/2022) uses right-of-access framing rather than authorization language — the patient is "requesting access" to their PHI, not "authorizing release." This is the correct legal framing under HIPAA § 164.524 and avoids confusing patients with irrelevant third-party authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The official website has a well-organized page at `/Patients-Visitors/Medical-Records-Requests` with direct PDF download links — no login, portal, or intermediary steps required. Standard web searches surfaced the page quickly. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. One potential source of confusion: the page notes that Washington University maintains separate medical records for WashU Clinic patients, which could leave some patients unsure whether they're requesting from the right entity.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF — admirably concise. It follows a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection (20 checkboxes) → date range → delivery preferences → signature → processing information. The "Abstract (includes all * documents)" checkbox is a clever shortcut — patients who want a comprehensive record can check one box instead of thirteen individual starred items. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery via email, a forward-thinking feature for a 2022 revision.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). Patients must print and fill by hand, then submit via fax (314-747-7211) or mail. This is the primary weakness: a form revised in 2022 should have interactive PDF fields as a basic digital accessibility expectation. The form does have a clean text layer, so annotation tools could work as a workaround, but it was not designed for that workflow.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes minimal barriers. No notarization or witness is required — just a patient signature and date. Fees are described in HIPAA-compliant language ("based on the cost of the labor and supplies"), though no specific fee schedule or estimate is provided. The 30-day response time is clearly stated, matching the HIPAA-mandated timeline, with a note about possible extensions.

The main red flag is the **Social Security Number request**. While the form offers "or last 4 digits" as an alternative, placing the full SSN as the primary ask collects more sensitive PII than necessary — a medical record number or date of birth should suffice. This is an unnecessary privacy risk in a patient access context.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party release — a best practice
- **Single-page design** that accomplishes a complete request without overwhelming the patient
- **Electronic delivery option** via email, with a dedicated field
- **"Abstract" checkbox** that bundles comprehensive records into one selection
- **Clear, plain-language** processing instructions with 30-day timeline

## Overall Assessment

Barnes-Jewish Hospital demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its records request process. The decision to create a dedicated patient access form — shorter, simpler, and legally distinct from the third-party authorization — reflects genuine attention to the patient experience. The website organization is exemplary. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a print-and-handwrite workflow despite the form being digitally authored. With interactive fields added, this would be a near-ideal patient access pathway. As it stands, the experience is good but not fully digital-first.

# Lexington Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lexington Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Lexington, Kentucky. Two ROI authorization forms were found on their website: a current 2024 version (form-1) co-branded with VitalChart, a third-party ROI processing vendor, and a legacy 2014 version (form-2) that remains publicly accessible but appears to be superseded. The 2024 form is the actively linked version on the Patient Forms page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

Lexington Clinic does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release" documents designed to serve all disclosure purposes — patient self-access, transfer of care, legal requests, and other third-party releases. However, form-1 includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Purpose of Disclosure," which effectively signals a Right of Access request even though the form never explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 or uses the term "Right of Access."

The organization funnels all records requests through VitalChart, which processes the authorization and fulfills the request. This vendor-mediated model means the patient completes a single generic authorization form and sends it to VitalChart rather than directly to Lexington Clinic's HIM department. No online portal or digital request wizard is available.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A straightforward web search returned direct PDF download links on the first attempt. The Patient Forms page at lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that the legacy 2014 form (form-2) remains publicly indexed and discoverable via search engines, with no version labeling or "superseded" notice — creating a risk that patients might find and use the outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally composed PDF with a clear text layer but **zero fillable fields** — a significant missed opportunity given its digital origin. A patient must print it, fill it by hand, and then submit it via mail, fax, or email to VitalChart. The layout is well-organized with six numbered sections following a logical "who → where → what → why → cost → sign" flow. Section headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are unusually conversational and patient-friendly for a medical-legal form. However, the legal disclosures in Section 6 shift to dense HIPAA boilerplate, and fitting everything onto one page makes the form somewhat dense.

Record-type granularity is good: patients can select specific providers, date ranges, conditions, and record subtypes (labs, radiology, office notes, immunizations, operative reports). Delivery options include mail, email, and fax (fax restricted to healthcare providers only). Email delivery to patients is a meaningful positive — many organizations offer only mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fee structure**: The form cites KRS 422.317, stating the first copy is free, with additional copies at $1.00 per page. While the first-copy-free provision is patient-friendly, the $1.00/page charge for subsequent copies may exceed HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based fee" limit for Right of Access requests. A $5.00 late fee and "non-refundable once services are rendered" language add financial friction not contemplated by HIPAA's access provisions.

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is not a HIPAA requirement for ROI authorization and raises privacy concerns.

**Submission ambiguity**: While VitalChart's mailing address, phone, fax, and email are listed at the bottom, the form never explicitly instructs patients on how to submit the completed authorization. A patient may be unsure whether they can email the completed form.

**No notarization or witness required** — a positive. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- First copy free with clear Kentucky statutory citation
- Email delivery available to patients (not just providers)
- Conversational, patient-friendly section headers
- Good record-type granularity enabling targeted requests
- Single-page, concise format
- Easy online findability

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Clinic provides a reasonably accessible records request process that clears several important bars: the form is easy to find, well-organized, and can be submitted electronically via fax or email to VitalChart. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization form design (no dedicated patient access pathway), and the potentially non-compliant fee structure for patient access requests hold it back from a higher rating. The organization's approach is typical of mid-sized independent practices that outsource ROI processing to a vendor — functional but not patient-centered.

# Medical City Dallas Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Medical City Dallas Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare's Medical City Healthcare division, provides patients with a single system-wide authorization form for requesting health records. The form is available in both English and Spanish as fillable PDFs linked from the hospital's medical records webpage. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients requesting their own records use the same generic HIPAA authorization form designed for all release-of-information scenarios, including third-party disclosures.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were retrieved, both hosted on HCA's digital asset management platform (`hcadam.com`):

- **Form 1** (English): HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21 — "Authorization for Release of PHI (Protected Health Information)." A 1-page fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields.
- **Form 2** (Spanish): HCA-840-00434-S — Direct Spanish translation of Form 1, with identical structure and 52 fillable fields.

Both forms are general-purpose release authorizations. The purpose-of-disclosure field offers "At the request of the individual" as one option alongside "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form does not distinguish between patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) and third-party authorization. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission wizard.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required navigating the hospital website to the medical records page (`/locations/medical-city-dallas-hospital/for-patients/medical-records`). Direct web searches returned stale 404 URLs from a previous hosting location (`medicalcityhealthcare.com/util/forms/`), with no redirects in place. Once on the correct page, the forms are clearly labeled and directly downloadable. No bot blocking or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed, born-digital PDF — not a scan. All 52 fields are interactive and fillable on-screen, eliminating the need for handwriting. The single-page format is efficient but extremely dense: patient demographics, recipient information, four delivery options (paper, electronic media, encrypted email, unencrypted email), 16+ record-type checkboxes, a six-point disclosure statement, psychotherapy notes handling, marketing/sale of PHI questions, and a signature block are all compressed into one page. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — functional for most adults but potentially challenging for low-literacy readers.

The form provides clear section headers (A, B, C) and logically groups related fields. Instructions are implicit in the form structure rather than stated separately. The consent statements correctly cover voluntary authorization, revocation rights, and non-conditioning of treatment — standard HIPAA requirements. The form mentions a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying an amount.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked "(optional)." While optional, collecting SSN on an ROI form is unnecessary for patient identification and creates a data exposure risk.
- **Centralized processing**: All requests go to HCA headquarters in Nashville (PO Box 290789), not to the local hospital. A patient expecting to deal with Medical City Dallas directly may find this confusing.
- **Fax restriction**: Fax delivery is limited to "Physician Office / Medical facility," which could restrict a patient's ability to receive records via fax at a non-medical location.
- **No online submission**: The form must be printed, signed, and mailed or faxed to Nashville. There is no portal-based or email submission option. However, fax submission is available (844-481-0298), meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language version**: A fully translated Spanish form with identical structure and fillable fields, linked with Spanish-language text from the same page — a meaningful accessibility feature for Dallas's large Spanish-speaking population.
- **USCDI release option**: The form includes a forward-looking option for USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release requests, acknowledging modern health data exchange standards. This is rare among ROI forms.
- **52 fillable fields**: Comprehensive digital interactivity means the entire form can be completed on-screen before printing for signature.
- **Four delivery format options**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients genuine choice.

## Overall Assessment

Medical City Dallas Hospital, via its parent HCA Healthcare, provides a technically competent ROI form that is fillable, multilingual, and reasonably well-organized. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — there is no dedicated patient access pathway. The form is a generic authorization that serves all purposes. Findability is hampered by broken legacy URLs, and the centralized Nashville processing model may confuse local patients. The form's document quality is solid (fillable, clear sections, multiple delivery options), but the lack of a patient-centric access pathway and the optional SSN field are notable shortcomings. The organization earns a mid-range assessment: technically adequate with meaningful strengths in multilingual access and digital form quality, but falling short on patient-centeredness and access pathway design.

# East Georgia Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

East Georgia Healthcare Center (EGHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Swainsboro, Georgia. Three documents were found on its website: an English-language Medical Records Release form (form-1), a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The critical finding is that **none of these documents serve a patient requesting their own records from EGHC**. Both release forms are designed exclusively for incoming records — authorizing other providers to send records *to* EGHC — with EGHC's own address hardcoded as the destination.

## Access Pathway: The Wrong Form Problem

EGHC exemplifies the "wrong form" problem identified in this study. The Medical Records Release form's key language reads: *"I hereby request copies of all records pertaining to my health history and medical care released to: EAST GEORGIA HEALTHCARE CENTER, 215 NORTH COLEMAN STREET, SWAINSBORO, GA 30401."* The "Requesting medical records from" field is where the patient fills in their *previous* provider. A patient trying to exercise their HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) to obtain records *from* EGHC would find no applicable form anywhere on the website.

The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — it simply does not address patient self-access at all. The Notice of Privacy Practices mentions the right to "inspect and copy medical information" but provides no actionable instructions, no form reference, and no guidance on how to actually submit a request. A patient would likely need to call the Privacy Officer or visit in person, with no written process to guide them.

## Retrieval Experience

The forms page at https://eghc.org/forms/ is findable within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via site navigation. However, the forms are hosted on RightSignature, a third-party e-signature platform, which requires entering a name and email before viewing the form content. Old direct PDF links (from 2019) now return 404 errors but still appear in search engine results, creating confusing dead ends. The retrieval required moderate effort: the forms page was located without difficulty, but extracting the actual form content from RightSignature required technical workarounds (extracting the S3-hosted PNG image and converting to PDF).

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page document with clean layout and clear visual hierarchy: letterhead at top, patient identification fields, destination address, source provider field, a granular 17-option record type checklist, release duration options, legal disclaimer, and signature block. Via the RightSignature platform, the form is interactive with fillable fields and e-signature capability — a meaningful step toward digital-first form handling. However, the standalone captured PDF is image-only with no text layer, no fillable fields, and is completely inaccessible to screen readers.

The language is moderately accessible — the legal disclaimer covers standard HIPAA authorization elements (revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, non-conditioning) without being impenetrably dense. The form collects approximately 10 fields, which is reasonable in scope. However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, which creates unnecessary data exposure risk given that name, date of birth, and address are already collected.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No patient access form**: The most significant barrier — a patient has no written pathway to request their own records.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers on a form designed for fax/mail transmission is an unnecessary privacy risk.
- **Missing authorization expiration**: The form lacks an explicit expiration date, a required element under 45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(v).
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees for record copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form text gives no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **RightSignature viewing barrier**: Patients must provide name and email before even viewing the form content.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Both English and Spanish versions of the release form are offered — appropriate for an FQHC serving a diverse community in south-central Georgia.
- **RightSignature e-signature**: Electronic completion and submission capability is a genuine digital-first investment, even if applied to the wrong form.
- **Granular record type selection**: The 17-category checklist with an "Other" option gives patients meaningful control over what information is released.
- **Title X confidentiality**: The NPP includes thoughtful language about Title X Family Planning Program confidentiality.

## Overall Assessment

EGHC has invested in some positive infrastructure — bilingual forms, an e-signature platform, and a navigable forms page — but these investments are undermined by a fundamental gap: the organization provides no form or pathway for patients to request their own records. The only ROI-related forms are designed for incoming records from other providers. A patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access would find their rights acknowledged in the NPP but no actionable way to exercise them online. This represents a significant patient-centeredness failure that overshadows the form's otherwise reasonable document quality.

# Blessing Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Blessing Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Quincy, Illinois, part of Blessing Health System. Five documents were retrieved — three superseded English versions (April 2023 and 2015), the current English authorization form (September 2025), and a current Spanish translation. The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf**, the September 2025 English "BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information," which is directly linked from the organization's Medical Records page alongside its Spanish counterpart (form-5.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Blessing Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary pathway is a **generic HIPAA authorization form** used for all releases of information — patient self-access, third-party disclosures, insurance, legal, and care transfers alike. The form uses bidirectional "RELEASE RECORDS FROM" / "RECORDS GOING TO" fields designed for inter-party transfers. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively authorizing the release of records from Blessing to themselves. The purpose options include "Personal reasons," which accommodates patient requests but does not distinguish them legally or procedurally from third-party authorization.

Notably, the retrieval notes indicate that Blessing Health also offers an **online records request tool** with identity verification via driver's license photo, mentioned on the Medical Records webpage. This provides a parallel digital pathway, though the PDF form remains the primary documented route.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Blessing Hospital authorization forms immediately returned direct PDF links, and the Medical Records page at blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords is well-organized under "For Patients > Request Medical Records." The one concern is version sprawl: three outdated English versions (from 2015 and April 2023) remain accessible at their original URLs with no deprecation notices or redirects. A patient arriving via a cached search result could unknowingly download a superseded form — including one that still requires a witness signature the organization has since eliminated.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4.pdf) is a **digitally authored, non-fillable 2-page PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks must be filled by hand after printing; circle instructions ("(Circle) Pick up or Mail or Fax or Email") reveal its print-first design. Despite this, the form is well-structured: patient demographics flow into records source/destination, then record type checkboxes (15 specific categories plus "Other"), sensitive information authorization, purpose, legal disclosures, and signatures. A dedicated page 2 provides **field-by-field completion guidelines** with plain-language examples — a genuine standout feature that most organizations omit.

The language is a mix: legal boilerplate on the authorization side is moderately dense, but the guidelines page compensates with concrete, accessible explanations. One persistent grammatical issue ("I authorize the use or disclosure of the above named individual's health information, its employees and agents, to furnish") creates ambiguity about who is authorizing what.

## Barriers and Compliance

The September 2025 revision made a significant improvement by **removing the witness signature requirement** that was present in the April 2023 versions — a barrier the organization itself recognized as unnecessary. No notarization is required. Photo identification "may be required," using permissive rather than mandatory language. The form does not disclose fees, though the website mentions a $6.50 flat fee for certain requests; HIPAA requires patients to be informed of fees before authorizing. The mandatory date range requirement ("MUST specify date range") could create friction for patients seeking comprehensive records. Submission can be made via mail or **fax** to three listed locations (Blessing Health System, Blessing Health Hannibal, and Denman Services), so patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

Blessing Hospital demonstrates several above-average practices: a **Spanish translation** linked alongside the English form, the detailed **completion guidelines** on page 2, **email as a delivery option**, active form improvement (witness requirement removal), and an **online records request tool** as an alternative pathway. The form is managed through PolicyStat, suggesting systematic version control.

## Overall Assessment

Blessing Hospital earns a **B** grade. The organization provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with helpful instructions and a Spanish translation — above average for a community hospital. However, the generic authorization design means patients requesting their own records must navigate a form not designed for them, and the non-fillable PDF format creates a paper-dependent workflow. The availability of an online records request tool and fax submission partially compensate for the print-and-fill form, but the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway and the absence of fee disclosure on the form itself are notable gaps.

# Boulder Medical Center — Organization Synthesis

## Available Pathways

Boulder Medical Center (BMC) presents patients with three record-request pathways, clearly laid out on their [Medical Records department page](https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/departments/medical-records/): (1) a Swellbox online portal for records created before September 9, 2024; (2) the MyChart "Sharing Hub" for records after that date; and (3) a downloadable PDF authorization form. The PDF form (`form-1.pdf`) was the only traditional document available for download and is the focus of this evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

BMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single PDF form — titled "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Patient Information" — is a generic ROI authorization designed to handle bidirectional record transfers between entities. While the phrase "I am requesting my records" appears, the form's structure treats the patient as a routing intermediary rather than the information recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no language explaining patient-specific rights beyond the standard no-conditioning clause. The online portals (Swellbox and MyChart) may provide a more patient-centric experience, but neither was evaluated as a downloadable form document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search led directly to the Medical Records page, where the PDF is clearly linked under "Option 2." No bot-blocking, JavaScript rendering, or deep navigation was required. The page helpfully contextualizes the PDF as one of three options, giving patients a clear choice. This is a strong findability result.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a single-page, digitally-created document — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print and handwrite. The layout follows a logical flow (demographics → delivery method → record types → entity information → authorization → signatures), but the authorization section is a dense block of nine "I understand" statements with no visual separation. The form includes some genuinely helpful plain-language disclosures ("once this information is disclosed by BMC, it will no longer be protected by BMC"), though the dual-direction design ("from the Entity... to be mailed to ___ at BMC" vs. "to be sent to Entity listed below") is confusing for a patient requesting their own records for personal use. Record type options are limited to five categories with no "all records" checkbox.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form states a 10-business-day processing time, well within HIPAA's 30-day window. It correctly includes a no-conditioning clause and a 180-day expiration. However, the fee disclosure is vague ("there may be a cost to copy the records") with no schedule or estimate. Most concerning is the email restriction: "Due to HIPAA regulations regarding security of electronic transmissions, we cannot email records to anyone but your personal email." This mischaracterizes HIPAA, which explicitly grants patients the right to direct records to a third party. The designated agent language is also narrowly scoped, covering only incapacitated patients rather than parents of minors or POA holders. Submission can be done by fax (303-449-9380) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple pathways**: The website clearly presents three options (Swellbox, MyChart, PDF), giving patients choices based on their record dates and preferences.
- **Single-page conciseness**: The form avoids the multi-page burden common at other organizations.
- **Plain-language disclosures**: Several authorization statements are unusually clear and honest.
- **Easy findability**: The form is prominently linked from a well-organized Medical Records page.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** despite being a digitally-created PDF — a missed opportunity.
- **No patient access differentiation**: The form treats all requests identically regardless of who is requesting and why.
- **Misleading HIPAA email restriction**: Incorrectly frames a policy choice as a legal requirement.
- **Stale form**: Revision date January 2019, uploaded November 2020, but a major system transition occurred in September 2024.

## Overall Assessment

Boulder Medical Center earns credit for making its form easy to find and for offering multiple request pathways including online portals. However, the PDF form itself is a generic, non-fillable ROI authorization that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The misleading email restriction and vague fee disclosure are compliance concerns. A patient can complete the process via fax or mail submission without visiting in person, which meets the baseline, but the lack of fillable fields and the form's dual-direction confusion reduce usability. The organization is adequate but not patient-centered in its PDF-based pathway.

# TriStar Centennial Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

TriStar Centennial Medical Center is an HCA Healthcare–affiliated community hospital in Nashville, TN. Three documents were retrieved: the primary English-language HCA authorization form (form-1), a Spanish translation (form-3), and a separate form for Centennial Medical Group, an affiliated physician practice in Elkridge, MD (form-2). The hospital's own forms (form-1 and form-3) are the relevant documents for assessing this facility's patient access experience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for authorization/release form terms immediately surfaced the hospital's medical records page, which is clearly organized under For Patients → Medical Records. Both English and Spanish PDF download links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or portal login was required. The HCA Digital Asset Management URLs worked with a standard download. This is about as easy as form retrieval gets.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

TriStar Centennial does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary document (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of PHI" designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release. The "Purpose of disclosure" field lists "At the request of the individual" as the first option, with "Other 3rd party recipient" as the alternative — but both flow through the same form, same fields, and same process. Patients must navigate Section B (marketing/sale of PHI disclosures) even when it doesn't apply, and the form's recipient fields are oriented toward third-party recipients rather than a simple "send me my records" workflow.

That said, the medical records page also offers a **Swellbox online portal** for digital submission and the **MyHealthONE patient portal** for direct record access, providing alternative pathways that may offer a more patient-centric experience. The existence of these portal options partially compensates for the generic form design.

## Form Document Quality

The primary HCA form (form-1) is technically excellent. It is a **digitally native, single-page PDF with 52 fillable fields** — covering every input from patient demographics to 16+ record-type checkboxes to delivery preferences. This is unusually thorough; many organizations provide flat, non-fillable PDFs that require printing and handwriting. The file is lean (170 KB, no embedded images, 9 fonts), confirming it was designed as a digital artifact rather than scanned from paper.

The form offers **four delivery format options** — paper copy, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email — which is above average. It includes a forward-looking **USCDI Release Request** option for structured health data exchange, though this feature is aimed at provider-to-provider use and would confuse most patients.

Layout is organized into three labeled sections (A: core authorization, B: marketing/sale disclosures, C: signatures), which provides logical structure. However, packing this much content into a single page means tight spacing and modest font sizes. The language is a mix of functional form labels and legal disclosures — the patient rights statements use reasonably plain first-person language ("I understand that…"), but passages like the unencrypted email risk disclaimer are dense.

The **Spanish translation** (form-3) is a full parallel version with identical structure and 52 fillable fields — not a scan or afterthought. A few staff-facing elements (footer text, "ID verified by" field) remain in English, but the patient-facing content is fully translated.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no significant barriers**. No notarization or witness is required. The SSN field is explicitly marked optional. The 180-day default expiration is reasonable with options for custom dates. Psychotherapy notes are properly separated per HIPAA requirements. Fee language references a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts — appropriate, though it gives patients no cost visibility.

Submission options include **fax (844-481-0298) and mail**, plus the Swellbox portal for fully digital submission. A patient can complete and submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual fillable PDFs**: Both English and Spanish versions with 52 interactive fields each, directly linked from the same page
- **USCDI release option**: Rare acknowledgment of interoperability standards on an ROI form
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Four options including encrypted email
- **Portal alternatives**: Swellbox and MyHealthONE provide digital-first pathways beyond the PDF
- **10-day turnaround** (on the CMG form) and clear contact information

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: The generic authorization form doesn't distinguish individual access rights from third-party release
- **Default to paper delivery**: If the delivery section is left blank, the patient gets paper — an electronic default would be more patient-friendly
- **Dense single page**: The amount of content compressed onto one page may challenge patients with limited literacy or visual impairments
- **Minor grammatical error**: "I may see and obtain a copy the information" is missing "of"

## Overall Assessment

TriStar Centennial earns a **B grade**. The technical quality of its forms is strong — fillable fields, bilingual availability, multiple delivery options, and a clean digital PDF. Retrieval is effortless. Compliance posture is solid with no unnecessary barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway: a patient requesting their own records navigates the same authorization form as an insurer or attorney, with no differentiation in process, language, or workflow. The availability of portal alternatives (Swellbox, MyHealthONE) partially mitigates this, but the core PDF experience doesn't center the patient as an individual exercising their right of access.

# Olmsted Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Olmsted Medical Center (OMC) is an independent nonprofit physician practice in Rochester, MN. Two forms were found on the organization's website: a primary "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (form-1) and a companion "Authorization for Allowing Verbal Communication of Protected Health Information" (form-2). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records; form-2 is limited to authorizing verbal discussions with a designated person and explicitly disclaims any written record release.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

OMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. The primary form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, employers, and others. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this generic form: they fill in OMC's address in the "Release Information From" field (pre-populated) and put their own name and address in the "Release Information To" field. The form includes a "Personal" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which at least provides a recognizable option, but there is no guidance text explaining how a patient should complete the form for self-access specifically. The form does not differentiate between individual access rights under § 164.524 and third-party authorization under § 164.508.

That said, the form does reference "CRF 164.524" (a typo for CFR) and includes a strong non-conditioning statement — both patient-protective elements that go beyond what many generic authorization forms include.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. OMC hosts a dedicated "Manage Your Health Information" page accessible through clear website navigation (Patients & Visitors > Your Care & Visit > Manage Your Health Information). Multiple search strategies — filetype:pdf queries, site-scoped searches, and direct navigation — all led to the form quickly. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot blocking, which prevented programmatic downloads via curl but would not affect a patient using a browser. The page also lists Spanish and Somali translations, MyChart proxy access forms, and the verbal communication authorization form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **62 interactive form fields** — a truly digital-first design, not a scan or print-only document. The layout uses a clean left-column label / right-column field structure with clearly delineated sections: patient demographics, release from/to, method of disclosure, date range, record type selection (a granular checkbox grid), reason for release, authorization/expiration, revocation rights, and signature. The language is mostly plain and functional, though the opening line — "This is a legal document" — may intimidate some patients. The authorization section includes standard but dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation.

Delivery options include mail, pick up, fax (marked "Urgent Only — limitations may apply"), and patient portal (also with "limitations may apply"). The inclusion of patient portal delivery is a positive signal, though the unexplained "limitations" qualifiers create uncertainty. Submission methods include any OMC location, postal mail, or fax (507.287.2777), with a phone number for questions. Fax availability means a patient can submit without visiting in person or relying on postal mail.

## Barriers and Compliance

OMC imposes no unusual barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no upfront fee disclosure. The one-year default authorization expiration is standard. Revocation rights are clearly stated and require written notice to the Health Information Department. The form explicitly references the patient's right to inspect or receive copies under CFR 164.524 and states that OMC will not condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility on signing the authorization — a strong compliance posture.

Minor issues include two typos ("CRF" for "CFR" and "provide" for "provided"), an inconsistent mailing address between form-1 and form-2, and the unexplained "limitations may apply" qualifiers on fax and portal delivery. The "File Only — No Records Needed at this time" option in the delivery section is an internal administrative option that may confuse patients.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in English, Spanish, and Somali — the Somali translation is notably community-responsive for Rochester, MN
- **62 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive digital form, uncommon in healthcare ROI
- **Patient portal delivery option** alongside traditional methods
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference** and non-conditioning statement — unusually transparent about patient rights
- **Clean single-page design** that fits comprehensive content without feeling cramped

## Overall Assessment

Olmsted Medical Center delivers a technically strong, well-organized, and accessible ROI form that is easy to find and free of significant barriers. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must use a generic third-party authorization form and figure out how to adapt it for their own purposes. Despite this, the form's quality, fillability, multilingual support, and compliance posture make it a solid option for patients. The organization earns a **B** grade: strong document quality and accessibility, held back by the generic-form-for-all-purposes approach to patient access.

# Adena Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Adena Regional Medical Center, a nonprofit community hospital in Chillicothe, Ohio and part of the Adena Health System, provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests. The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — patients requesting their own records must navigate the same form designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. Three documents were found on the organization's medical records request page: two versions of the same ROI authorization form (one current, one outdated) and a fee schedule.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf** (CLI.1777, Rev. 10/25), a one-page "Authorization: Release of Information Form" that serves as the current version. An older version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/02/2020) is also linked from the same page under "Option 3 – By Mail or Fax," creating confusion about which form to use. The fee schedule (form-3.pdf) is a supplementary document published as an image-only scan with no text layer.

Submission is available by mail or fax. Form-2 explicitly lists the fax number (740-779-7769) and mailing address; form-1 does not include a fax number, an oversight that may force patients to hunt for contact information. No online portal submission for records requests was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Adena does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both form versions use a three-way checkbox ("Obtain records from / Release records to / Exchange verbal information with") oriented toward third-party disclosure flows. A patient requesting their own records would need to check "Release records to" and enter their own name as recipient — a non-obvious workflow. The form includes "Personal" as a purpose-of-disclosure option, which is a helpful signal, but there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or any language distinguishing patient-access requests from third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search for the medical records release form surfaced the dedicated medical records request page at `/patients-and-visitors/patient-rights/medical-records-request` on the first attempt. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. All PDFs were directly downloadable. The page is logically located under "Patient Rights," reachable in approximately three clicks from the homepage.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created, text-based PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand (or use a third-party PDF annotation tool). The form fits on a single page, which is commendable for brevity, but the layout is cramped as a result. Sections flow logically (demographics → direction → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → rights → signature), though there are no formal section headers. The record type selection is comprehensive, offering 14 options including an "Abstract" bundle. Language is moderately legalistic, particularly in the "I understand the following" rights section. An "Administrative Use Only – Driver's license number" field at the very top may confuse patients into thinking it's required.

A notable positive: the form explicitly offers electronic delivery of records via email, putting it ahead of many peers. However, no encryption or secure delivery mechanism is mentioned.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is a **witness signature requirement** — HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient authorizations, and a patient filling out the form at home would need to find a witness, potentially discouraging submission. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which is common but not required by HIPAA and raises data security concerns.

Fee language is problematic: the form states charges "WILL" apply "in accordance with Ohio Law" without distinguishing patient-access requests (subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee cap) from third-party releases (subject to potentially higher state rates). The fee schedule is published proactively on the medical records page — a positive practice — but as an image-only scan it is inaccessible to screen readers, translation tools, and text search.

The psychotherapy notes checkbox requires "approval by psychotherapist," which is appropriate for third-party release but would constitute an impermissible barrier if applied to patient self-access requests.

## Overall Assessment

Adena Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and concise, with some thoughtful features like electronic delivery and comprehensive record type options. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party-oriented design, the witness signature requirement, and ambiguous fee language collectively create a process that works for patients who are persistent but was clearly not designed with patient self-access as a priority. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate but with meaningful room for improvement in both form design and patient-centeredness.

# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Three PDF forms were found for Carle BroMenn Medical Center, a community hospital in Normal, IL that is part of the Carle Health regional system:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary general ROI authorization form specific to the BroMenn/Normal campus (form code X3833-0820). One page. Covers Carle West Physician Group, Carle BroMenn Medical Center, and Carle Eureka Hospital.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A nearly identical system-level Carle Health ROI form for the Champaign campus (form code 174-0319). One page. Same structure but branded for the main Carle campus HIM department.
3. **form-3.pdf** — A behavioral health–specific authorization form for the BroMenn campus (form code X3852-0620). Two pages. Required separately for mental health records per Illinois law.

**Form-1 is the most relevant document** for a patient at Carle BroMenn Medical Center requesting their own general medical records. Form-2 serves the Champaign campus and would likely confuse a BroMenn patient. Form-3 is a companion form needed only for behavioral health records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Carle BroMenn does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" documents designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios. The form uses "To Send to" / "To Request from" framing, requiring patients to navigate a form designed for inter-provider transfers, legal disclosures, and insurance requests. There is no streamlined form or process specifically for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

That said, the form does include some patient-oriented elements: delivery via MyCarle Account (the patient portal), an explicit citation of CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access regulation), and a clear statement that signing is not required for treatment.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches surfaced direct PDF download links on carle.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or multi-step navigation was required. The carle.org medical records page links to the forms. All three were directly downloadable via curl. The only minor friction: a patient might encounter both form-1 (BroMenn-specific) and form-2 (Champaign-specific) without clear guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **digitally-authored but non-fillable PDF**. Despite being created digitally (not a scan), it has zero interactive form fields — every field must be filled by hand after printing. This is a significant missed opportunity. The form is well-organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of release → delivery method → record type selection → legal terms → signature. The granular record-type checkbox grid (30+ categories across hospitalization and clinic columns) gives patients meaningful control over scope. However, the single-page design makes the form cramped, with small font (estimated 8–9pt for legal text) and limited write-in space.

The language is a mix of clear and legalistic. Legal disclaimers are reasonably comprehensible but dense. The "ATTENTION: This is a legal document" warning is somewhat intimidating. There is no plain-language summary.

## Barriers

- **Purpose of disclosure required**: The form requires patients to state why they want their records — a requirement that is potentially non-compliant with HIPAA's Right of Access, which prohibits requiring a reason for patient self-access requests.
- **SSN field not marked optional**: Asks for last 4 digits of SSN without indicating it can be left blank.
- **Paper-only workflow**: No fillable fields, no fax number for submission, no email submission. A patient must print, handwrite, and mail the form or deliver it in person.
- **Behavioral health witness requirement**: Form-3 requires a witness signature for both the authorization and revocation — a barrier not required by HIPAA.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: States "there may be a charge" with no amounts. Form-3 mentions ScanStat as the third-party vendor processing requests.
- **No notarization required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — mail is an option.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyCarle Account electronic delivery** for records (30-day window) provides a digital delivery pathway even though the request itself is paper-based.
- **Explicit HIPAA citation** (CFR 164.524) — uncommon and commendable transparency about patient rights.
- **Granular record-type selection** gives patients fine-grained control over what is released.
- **Easy online findability** of forms with direct download links.
- **Appropriate behavioral health protections** including 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language and age-appropriate consent (12+ for mental health).

## Overall Assessment

Carle BroMenn Medical Center provides a functional but dated records request process. The forms are easy to find and reasonably well-organized, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of electronic submission options, and generic authorization design that doesn't differentiate patient self-access from third-party release hold it back. The purpose-of-disclosure requirement is a compliance concern for patient access requests. The organization earns credit for MyCarle Account delivery, explicit rights citations, and granular scope controls, but the fundamentally paper-based workflow and generic form design place it in the middle of the pack for patient-centeredness.

# Minnie Hamilton Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Minnie Hamilton Health System (MHHS) is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Grantsville, West Virginia, affiliated with Mon Health. The organization does not publish any downloadable ROI or patient access form on its website. Instead, it directs all medical records requests through ChartRequest, a third-party online portal. Two documents were downloaded during this evaluation: a patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) and a Mon Health Medical Center authorization form (form-2.pdf) from the affiliate system — neither is an MHHS-branded records request form.

## Access Pathway

MHHS routes patients to ChartRequest (https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville) for medical records requests. This is an online portal where the authorization form is embedded in the electronic workflow. While portal-based submission is inherently electronic and potentially convenient, ChartRequest requires account creation before a patient can even see the authorization form or understand the terms of the request. This creates opacity — patients cannot preview the form, understand fee structures, or assess what information they'll need to provide before committing to a third-party account.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ChartRequest portal appears to be a general records release platform, not a pathway specifically designed for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. There is no publicly visible indication that MHHS has a separate, streamlined process for patients requesting their own records.

MHHS also maintains an Athena Health patient portal for clinical messaging, but the only downloaded document about it (form-1.pdf) covers sending documents *to* providers — the opposite direction of a records request. Whether a patient could request records through a portal message is unclear; the website directs records requests exclusively through ChartRequest.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding records request information for MHHS was **hard**. An extensive search process — multiple query variations, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine CDX API queries, and direct website navigation — failed to surface any downloadable ROI form. The MHHS website has no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. The website does link to ChartRequest from the patients page, but there is no standalone form to evaluate. The Mon Health authorization form (form-2.pdf) was located only by broadening the search to the affiliate system and is branded exclusively for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — a separate facility approximately 150 miles away.

## Form Document Quality

Because MHHS does not publish a standalone form, there is no primary form to assess for document quality in the traditional sense. The ChartRequest portal workflow could not be evaluated without creating an account. The Mon Health form (form-2.pdf), while not applicable to MHHS, provides the closest reference point: it is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) with dense content, a 4.1 MB file size (extremely bloated with 40 embedded images and 107 fonts), and no instructions for patients. It is a generic third-party authorization form that includes "Personal Use" as one purpose option but is not designed around patient self-access.

The patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) is well-written with numbered steps and plain language, suggesting MHHS is capable of producing clear patient-facing materials — but this capability was not applied to the records request process.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The primary barrier is **gatekeeping behind account creation**. Patients must create a ChartRequest account before they can access the authorization form or learn anything about the records request process. For patients with limited internet access or digital literacy — a real concern in rural Grantsville, WV — this is a significant obstacle. There is no phone-based or paper-based alternative publicly documented on the website, though the medical records department phone number (304-354-9700, ext. 2521) is listed.

No fee information is publicly available. No response time commitment is published. No patient rights information is accessible before engaging with the ChartRequest platform. The lack of any publicly visible authorization terms means patients cannot make informed decisions about the process before entering it.

## Strengths

- **Electronic submission pathway**: The ChartRequest portal provides a fully digital workflow, eliminating the need for printing, faxing, or mailing paper forms.
- **Digital-first approach**: MHHS has adopted modern platforms (Athena Health portal, ChartRequest) rather than relying solely on paper-based processes.
- **Clear instructional writing**: The patient portal guide demonstrates an ability to produce accessible, well-structured patient materials.

## Overall Assessment

Minnie Hamilton Health System presents a paradox: it has adopted a modern electronic records request platform, but in doing so has made the process less transparent and less accessible than many organizations that simply post a PDF form. The complete absence of a publicly available authorization form, fee schedule, timeline, or patient rights information means that MHHS patients enter the records request process with no visibility into what to expect. The reliance on a third-party platform with mandatory account creation creates an unnecessary gatekeeping barrier, particularly problematic for a rural critical access hospital serving a population that may have limited internet access. While the ChartRequest workflow may be well-designed internally, the opaque exterior facing patients undermines what could otherwise be a modern, patient-friendly approach.

# Maury Regional Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Maury Regional Health, a nonprofit regional system based in Columbia, TN (encompassing Maury Regional Medical Center, Marshall Medical Center, Wayne Medical Center, and Maury Regional Medical Group), provides a reasonably accessible records request experience with several notable strengths — particularly multilingual availability and multiple delivery channels — but falls short of best-in-class by relying on a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms were found, both linked from the Medical Records page (`/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/`):

- **Form 1 (Form 131, 08/2018):** English-language "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a single-page, general-purpose ROI form.
- **Form 2 (Form 131S, 05/2017):** Spanish-language translation of the same form, though dated over a year earlier and containing content discrepancies.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, the medical records page also offers an **online request portal via Swellbox** and access through the **My Maury Health Patient Portal**, giving patients three distinct channels. Fax submission (931.380.4092) and phone contact (931.380.4089) are also listed.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Maury Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form serves all purposes — requesting your own records, releasing to an attorney, sending to an insurer, etc. However, the form does accommodate patient access by listing "Myself" as the first option in the recipient field and including "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox. A patient can use this form, but must navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios (specifying a recipient name/address, selecting among purposes that don't apply). The availability of the Swellbox online portal is a meaningful alternative that may provide a more streamlined patient experience, though the portal itself was not evaluated in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A site-scoped search immediately surfaced the medical records page. The page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Medical Records). PDFs are hosted on Cloudinary CDN and downloaded without authentication or bot blocking. The only minor difficulty was a 403 error from the web_fetch tool on the medical records page, requiring browser fallback — but the PDFs themselves downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (Form 131) is a clean, single-page, digitally-created PDF — not a scan. It has a proper text layer enabling screen reader access and text search. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring handwriting after printing. The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (demographics → direction of release → purpose → date range → record types → format → consent → signature) and uses reasonable visual hierarchy with checkboxes and section groupings. Language is a blend of plain English and necessary legal terminology — the consent bullets are clearly written, though the sensitive information disclosure section is dense.

The form offers an unusually good set of **four delivery format options**: paper copies, CD, USB flash drive, and encrypted email — with a thoughtful security disclosure about email risks.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required.**
- **No fees disclosed** — the form says nothing about costs.
- **Hold harmless clause** is a red flag: "The facility is hereby released and discharged of any liability, and I will hold the facility harmless for complying with this authorization." HIPAA does not permit conditioning access on signing a liability release.
- **90-day authorization expiration** is relatively short but within norms.
- **Photo ID verification** on the English form implies in-person submission, though the website lists fax as an option.
- **No response time commitment** stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — uncommon among community hospitals in this study.
- **Multiple request channels** (PDF, Swellbox portal, patient portal, fax, phone).
- **Encrypted email delivery** option with proactive security disclosure.
- **"Myself" listed first** in the recipient field — a subtle but meaningful patient-centric design choice.

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must use a generic authorization form.
- **Non-fillable PDF** — requires printing and handwriting.
- **Spanish form is outdated** (05/2017 vs. 08/2018 English) with missing content (no Social Security/Disability purpose, no Photo ID section).
- **Hold harmless clause** is potentially noncompliant for patient access requests.
- **Sensitive information limitation** is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to exercise it.

## Overall Assessment

Maury Regional Health provides an accessible, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process with commendable multilingual support and multiple submission channels. The main shortcomings are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, a non-fillable PDF form, and a potentially problematic liability waiver. The availability of the Swellbox online portal partially compensates for the PDF's limitations, and the overall experience is adequate — a patient can successfully request their own records without undue difficulty, though the process could be more patient-centric.

# Erlanger Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga, TN provides three distinct ROI-related documents: a general system-wide "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form-1), a behavioral health–specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" (form-3). The existence of form-3 — a purpose-built patient access request form — is the key differentiator for this organization and the focus of this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Erlanger is one of the organizations that clearly distinguishes between a patient exercising their right of access and a third-party release authorization. Form-3 is titled "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" and opens with the option to "give me a copy of my health information" — framing the interaction as a patient right rather than an authorization for disclosure. This is structurally separate from form-1, which serves as the general-purpose ROI authorization covering any release direction (to self, third party, insurer, attorney, etc.). The existence of this dedicated pathway shows deliberate organizational awareness that patient access and third-party release are different use cases with different legal frameworks.

However, the dedicated form originates from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital (EWCH) and it is unclear from the form itself whether it applies system-wide. The general ROI form (form-1) does include a "_________myself" option in the "Release Information To" field, providing an alternate pathway through the broader form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. All three were surfaced through a single web search, with no login walls, bot blocking, or broken links. The main erlanger.org site hosts a Medical Records page under patient tools. Form-3's URL is under a "murphy" path that may be associated with a specific facility building, making it less discoverable via direct site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the primary patient access form, is a single-page, digitally authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The layout is clean and logical, flowing from patient identification through facility selection, date range, record type checkboxes, format preference, delivery method, and signature. The language is notably plain and patient-friendly, using first-person phrasing: "I would like," "I want these parts of my record." The form provides granular record selection with 18 options across hospital and office/clinic categories, giving patients meaningful control over scope.

Form-1 (the general ROI) is also digitally authored with a text layer but no fillable fields (2 pages, 14+ record type options). Form-2 (behavioral health) is an image-only scan — inaccessible to screen readers and impossible to fill electronically.

## Submission Methods

Form-3 does not clearly state how to submit the completed form. An "EWCH Use Only" section with "ID Verified" checkboxes implies in-person submission may be expected. However, the broader Erlanger system accepts fax submissions — form-2's instruction page provides a fax number for the HIM department, and form-1 includes fax as a contact/delivery option. Mail is also available. No online portal or email submission option exists for the forms themselves, though secure email is offered as a records *delivery* method.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness requirements exist. The primary patient access form (form-3) is completely silent on fees — patients have no idea if they will be charged. Form-1 mentions "charges may apply" for CD and paper copies but does not specify amounts. Form-3 notes a 30-day turnaround, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Both form-1 and form-3 request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary when combined with name, DOB, and medical record number. Form-1 bundles sensitive-category consent (substance abuse, HIV, mental health) with no opt-out mechanism, which may raise 42 CFR Part 2 concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release — a meaningful structural choice
- **Plain-language, first-person framing** that is unusually patient-friendly
- **Granular record type selection** (18 options across hospital and clinic settings)
- **Secure email as a delivery option** for receiving records
- **Single-page simplicity** for the patient access form

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any form — all require print-and-handwrite workflow
- **No fee disclosure** on the patient access form
- **Unclear submission process** for form-3 (implies in-person with ID verification)
- **No patient rights statement** on the dedicated access form
- **Behavioral health form (form-2)** is an image-only scan with production errors (placeholder text left in)

## Overall Assessment

Erlanger demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form with plain language and granular record selection. The organizational awareness that patient access differs from third-party release is commendable. However, the complete absence of fillable fields, unclear submission instructions, and lack of fee transparency prevent the experience from being truly streamlined. The overall pathway earns a **B** — solid design intent held back by technical and process execution gaps.

# St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Phoenix, AZ, offers a notably differentiated approach to medical records access. The organization maintains separate forms for patient self-access (form-2.pdf) and third-party release (form-3.pdf), with its medical records webpage clearly distinguishing between the two pathways. This separation is a meaningful patient-centeredness achievement that many organizations fail to provide.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" (X-MR-4869, dated 02/22) — a 5-page dedicated patient access form linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" option. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
- **form-3.pdf**: A 2-page third-party authorization form (X-MR-4862, dated 03/13) — an image-only scan used for releasing records to physicians or other parties.
- **form-1.pdf**: A general Arizona Dignity Health authorization form found via web search but not linked from the St. Joseph's page. It references Mercy Gilbert Medical Center and appears to be from a different facility.

The medical records page also references an online Patient Center/Patient Portal as an alternative access channel (Section D of form-2).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating approximately 4–5 clicks through the Dignity Health website (Home → Arizona → St. Joseph's → Patients and Visitors → For Patients → Medical Records). The path is logical and well-structured, though it requires traversing the multi-facility health system hierarchy. The medical records page clearly separates patient self-request from third-party authorization — a helpful distinction that reduces confusion at the point of access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

St. Joseph's stands out for maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** that is clearly distinct from its third-party release authorization. Form-2 is explicitly titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and covers only patient self-access, while form-3 handles third-party disclosures. This organizational separation reflects genuine awareness of the difference between HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) and authorization for disclosure (§ 164.508).

However, the execution has some issues. The form's processing language states the hospital will "contact you with either denial or acceptance of the request" — framing patient access as discretionary rather than as a right that must be fulfilled within 30 days. Additionally, the employee verification block on page 4 (fields for "ID Presented" and staff verification) implies in-person presentation may be expected, even though email and fax submission are explicitly offered.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is digitally typeset with a clean text layer but contains **zero fillable form fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The form is organized into five lettered sections (A through E) with a logical progression: access type → delivery format → record types → patient portal → directing records to others. This structure is clear and well-conceived.

The form offers unusually comprehensive delivery options: USB drive, CD, secure email, unsecured email, and paper. Submission can be done via email (DignityHealth-AZ-ROI@DignityHealth.org) or fax (two numbers provided), eliminating the need for physical visits. Record type granularity is excellent, with 14+ specific categories plus a "Complete Health Record" option.

The main content design weaknesses are the routing complexity on page 1 — six different email addresses and three fax numbers for different departments, requiring patients to determine which contact handles their request — and the multi-state sensitive records sections (Arizona, California, and Nevada), which add confusion for patients at an Arizona facility. At 5 pages (4 patient-facing plus a facility-only denial page), the form is moderately long but justified by the breadth of options.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. Submission is available via email and fax, so no in-person visit is necessary. Fees are mentioned ("Fees may apply. See attached price list") but the referenced price list is not included in the PDF, leaving patients unable to assess costs upfront. No specific response time or turnaround commitment is stated. A Spanish version of the form is available, which is a positive accessibility feature for the Phoenix market.

## Overall Assessment

St. Joseph's earns credit for the structural decision to maintain a dedicated patient access form — a practice that most organizations do not follow. The form offers genuine patient choice in record types and delivery formats. However, the lack of fillable fields, complex routing instructions, discretionary "acceptance" language, and missing fee schedule prevent the experience from reaching its potential. The result is an organization that has the right framework but falls short in execution, landing at a **C grade (3.40)** that reflects adequate but improvable service to patients requesting their own records.

# Consensus Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Consensus Health operates as a decentralized network of independent physician practices in New Jersey. Four documents were retrieved, but none is a dedicated patient records request form. The most relevant document for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf**, a generic, unbranded one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN — not on any Consensus Health website. The remaining three documents are Consensus Health–branded intake paperwork from Skylands Medical Group (a member practice): a general consent/disclosure/authorization form (form-2), a HIPAA acknowledgment (form-3), and a seven-page Notice of Privacy Practices (form-4). None of these serves as a patient-initiated records request mechanism.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Consensus Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The only ROI-adjacent form (form-1) is framed entirely as a third-party disclosure authorization — its language ("authorize the disclosure of information from my health record" to a named "Person/Organization/Facility") assumes records are being sent to someone other than the patient. There is no form, process, or web page designed for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The organization appears to direct patients to the athenahealth patient portal or to contact the office by phone, but no documented ROI workflow exists through either channel.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any relevant form was **extremely difficult**. The main Consensus Health website has no patient forms section. Extensive searching — direct navigation, URL guessing across multiple paths, site-specific searches, and PDF filetype searches — produced nothing. The generic ROI form was only found through a general web search linking to a PatientPop-hosted PDF loosely associated with Consensus Health practices. The Consensus Health–branded documents were discovered on a member practice's WordPress site (Skylands Medical Group), not on any Consensus Health–owned domain. A patient visiting consensushealth.com would find no path to an ROI form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available ROI document, is a bare-bones single-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects approximately 11 fields (patient name, record number, address, DOB, free-text information requested, free-text purpose, recipient name/address/phone, and signature/date). The layout is plain and functional, and the language is reasonably clear. However, the form is critically incomplete: it provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or any indication of where to send the completed form. It carries no organizational branding, so a patient cannot confirm it belongs to their provider. A patient completing this form would have no idea what to do with it.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No submission pathway**: The form provides zero information about how to submit it — a functional barrier that effectively renders the form unusable without outside knowledge.
- **Missing HIPAA-required authorization elements**: The form lacks an expiration date, revocation language, and the name of the disclosing entity — elements required under 45 CFR § 164.508(c) for a valid authorization.
- **"Record Number" field**: The form asks for a medical record number without explaining where the patient would find this.
- **Vague fee language**: The NPP (form-4) mentions "reasonable fees" for copies but provides no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **"Proprietary & Confidential" marking** on the NPP — an odd designation for a document HIPAA requires to be publicly available.

## Notable Strengths

- The **Notice of Privacy Practices** (form-4) is substantive and current (Version 2.0, 2025), including reproductive health care protections reflecting the 2024 HIPAA Final Rule and explicit acknowledgment of patients' right to electronic access.
- The NPP states a **30-day response commitment** for records requests, aligning with HIPAA standards.
- The consent form (form-2) has a well-designed **authorized individuals section** with granular health/payment disclosure options and a detailed **contact preferences** section.

## Overall Assessment

Consensus Health presents a significant challenge for patients seeking their own medical records online. The organization has no centralized patient forms infrastructure, no dedicated records request form, and no documented electronic submission pathway. The only ROI-adjacent form found is an unbranded, non-fillable, third-party authorization template that lacks essential information for a patient to act on it. While the athenahealth patient portal may offer an alternative pathway, this is not documented or promoted as a records request mechanism. The decentralized practice model means patients at different member practices may have different (and equally opaque) experiences. This organization's approach to patient records access is best characterized as an afterthought — not hostile, but functionally absent from its public-facing digital presence.

# Mankato Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mankato Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Mankato, Minnesota. Two PDF forms were found — both versions of the same "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" document (form MC032). Form-1 (revised 02/23) is the current version; form-2 (revised 07/20) is a superseded version that remains publicly accessible. The clinic also offers an online medical record request tool and accepts submissions via fax, email, and DocuSign, providing patients with multiple channels beyond the PDF form itself.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Mankato Clinic does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. Both forms use a generic two-party structure — "Release my medical records from" (source) and "Share my medical records with" (destination) — requiring a patient who wants their own records to awkwardly list Mankato Clinic as the source and themselves as the destination. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no indication that patients have a legal right to obtain their records. The form is framed entirely as a release/disclosure authorization.

That said, the clinic does offer an **online medical record request tool** at a separate URL, which may provide a more streamlined patient self-access experience. The ROI page also notes that DocuSign is accepted, and patients can submit signed authorizations by fax (507-388-1878) or email (ROI@mankatoclinic.com). This gives patients practical electronic submission options even though the PDF form itself is print-oriented.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced direct PDF links and the dedicated Release of Information page at `mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/`. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The ROI page provides clear contact information and links to both the PDF form and the online request tool. One minor concern: both the current and superseded form versions remain live with no redirect or deprecation notice, which could confuse patients.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — page 1 is the authorization, page 2 is a full page of field-by-field instructions. Despite being natively digital, the form has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, handwrite, and return via fax or mail. The policy that "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized" reinforces the print-and-sign workflow.

The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → source → destination → record types → reason → signature. Section headers use bolded questions ("WHO HAS INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE RELEASED?") with sidebar labels, creating a clear visual hierarchy. The form-1 revision improved readability by replacing clinical labels ("Health Care Facility / Provider") with plain language ("Release my medical records from"). The 11 record-type checkboxes cover a reasonable range including sensitive categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health/substance abuse). The instruction page is a genuine bright spot — section-by-section guidance that is uncommon and practically useful.

The form is English-only. Field count is moderate (approximately 20 fields including patient demographics, source/destination addresses, checkboxes, and signature). The legal boilerplate is clear and reasonably concise.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **Fees**: Vaguely disclosed — "I understand there may be a charge" with no amounts or schedule. Patients cannot anticipate costs before submitting.
- **Turnaround**: 7–10 business days stated, well within HIPAA's 30-day window.
- **Witness line**: The older form-2 includes a "Witnessed by" line (removed in form-1), which could have been perceived as a barrier.
- **Delivery options**: The form lists physical delivery methods only (given, mailed, faxed, pick up). The older form-2 instructions explicitly state "Medical records are not able to be emailed." No electronic delivery option appears on either form.
- **Authorization expiration**: 12 months with written revocation — standard and compliant.
- **Treatment conditioning**: Properly disclosed with HIPAA-compliant exceptions.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated instruction page** with practical guidance ("We prioritize requests by appointment date")
- **Multiple ROI contact points** — three offices with dedicated phone/fax, plus email
- **Accepts any HIPAA-compliant form**, including the Minnesota Standard Consent Form
- **Online request tool** available as an alternative to the PDF form
- **Modernized plain-language labels** in the current form version

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable fields on a natively digital PDF — an unnecessary friction point
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release
- Vague fee disclosure with no specific amounts
- No mention of patient rights or HIPAA Right of Access
- Two versions of the same form hosted simultaneously without deprecation notice

## Overall Assessment

Mankato Clinic makes its ROI form easy to find and provides multiple submission channels (fax, email, online tool), which removes the most critical access barriers. The form itself is well-organized with an unusually helpful instruction page. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization framing (no patient access pathway differentiation), and vague fee disclosure keep it from excelling. The organization's practical accommodations — multiple contact points, alternative submission methods, acceptance of any HIPAA-compliant form — partially compensate for the form's design limitations.

# Hendrick Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hendrick Health, a nonprofit regional hospital system based in Abilene, TX, provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records requests — one for the hospital arm (Hendrick Medical Center, including South and Brownwood campuses) and one for the outpatient clinic arm (Hendrick Clinic). Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information, not dedicated patient self-access request forms. No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Hendrick Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting disclosure. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information (PHI)" and frame the transaction as a release between two named parties. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name in the "authorize" blank and again in the "who can receive" section — a workflow designed for attorneys, insurers, and other requestors, not for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The forms do include "Personal Use" as one of seven disclosure reasons, which accommodates patient self-access, but it is not highlighted or explained. There is no mention of the patient's Right of Access, no fee limitation language, and no stated response timeline.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Standard web searches immediately surfaced the Medical Records page (hendrickhealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/), which links directly to both PDFs with clear descriptions. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, login wall, or browser automation was required. The URLs are descriptive and stable. This is a findability bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1 (hospital)** is the stronger of the two forms and represents the best available pathway. It is a single-page flat PDF (zero fillable fields) with a text layer — digitally created from a Word document but exported without interactive form fields. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit via fax (325-670-6538), mail, email, or in-person pickup. The Hendrick Service Center address and contact information are pre-populated, reducing patient guesswork.

The form is organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → sensitive record initials → reason for disclosure → legal text → party identification → signatures. Record type granularity is a strength, with 16+ specific checkboxes plus an "all health information" option. However, the legal text in the lower third is dense, small-font legalese citing Texas Health & Safety Code § 181.154(c) and 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(1). No plain-language summary of patient rights is provided.

**Form-2 (clinic)** is structurally identical but notably weaker: it omits the email delivery option, lacks pre-filled contact information (leaving patients unsure where to submit), and omits a dates-of-service field. Patients who received care at both hospital and clinic entities would need to complete two separate forms with no cross-referencing guidance.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization, witness, or in-person submission is required — these are positive absences. Fees are not mentioned at all (neither disclosed nor waived). The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is unnecessary for HIPAA-compliant record identification but is a minor rather than severe barrier.

Both forms misspell "HIPAA" as "HIPPA" — a factual error that appears in the opening paragraph and undermines credibility. Form-2's PDF metadata exposes internal document management details ("Page 2__05.2022 MASTER-Authorization to Obtain or Release PHI- - Copy.docx"), suggesting careless export. The title of form-1 ("Authorization to Release Health Information") contradicts its subtitle ("Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information"), creating directional confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery** on the hospital form is uncommon and provides a digital delivery pathway
- **Pre-populated facility contact information** on form-1 reduces patient burden
- **Granular record selection** gives patients meaningful control over what is released
- **Single-page format** keeps the form manageable despite dense content

## Overall Assessment

Hendrick Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find and free of major barriers, but the organization channels all requestors — patients, attorneys, insurers — through the same generic authorization form without acknowledging that patient self-access is a distinct right with different rules. The flat, non-fillable PDFs represent a missed opportunity for digital-first design, and the split between hospital and clinic forms adds unnecessary complexity. A patient can get their records here without undue hardship, but the process was clearly not designed with them as the primary audience.

# UPMC Presbyterian — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

UPMC Presbyterian uses the system-wide UPMC "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (form-1.pdf), a two-page PDF hosted on UPMC's Digital Asset Management CDN. Two additional documents were found: an In-Home Urgent Care variant (form-2.pdf) for home-based care services, and an informational guide (form-3.pdf) that walks patients through completing the main form. The primary form relevant to a patient at UPMC Presbyterian requesting their own hospital records is form-1.pdf.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UPMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to physicians, insurers, attorneys, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form used for third-party release, selecting "Personal Use" as the purpose and listing themselves as the recipient. However, UPMC does include a notable inline annotation: **"Purpose is not required for patient access,"** a clear acknowledgment of HIPAA individual access rights that most organizations omit. This partially bridges the gap, but the form's structure — "I authorize UPMC to release information to: [Facility/Person to Receive Records]" — remains fundamentally oriented toward release to third parties. There is no separate patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a MyChart-based records request workflow in the materials reviewed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links on UPMC's CDN. The form is prominently linked from both the system-wide medical records page and the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page. No bot blocking, broken links, or login requirements were encountered. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a **born-digital but print-first PDF**. Despite being created digitally (22 embedded fonts, not a scan), it has essentially no fillable fields — only 1 unnamed interactive field was detected across the entire document. All data entry points use underscore-style blank lines and checkbox squares intended for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit it via mail or fax.

The form is **extremely dense**. Page 1 packs facility selection (14+ UPMC hospitals), patient demographics, recipient information, purpose, disclosure format, delivery method, record type selection (20+ specific document types), sensitive-information opt-outs, expiration terms, and signature blocks onto a single page. While the logical flow is sound (sections labeled A through C), the tight spacing and small text create a visually overwhelming experience. Page 2 contains patient rights and responsibilities disclosures.

The language mixes plain English with legal terminology. Instructions like "Parts 1 and 2 below must be completed" are clear, but fee language and re-disclosure warnings are dense. The 20+ record-type checkboxes offer impressive granularity but may overwhelm patients who simply want "all my records."

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Fee language is ambiguous for patient access.** The form states "charges may be associated with this request" citing Pennsylvania state law, without distinguishing patient access (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) from third-party requests. The phrase "records will be sent upon receipt of payment" could be read as conditioning access on pre-payment.
- **90-day default authorization expiration** is unusually short and may force resubmission if processing is slow, though patients can specify up to one year.
- **No fillable fields** despite born-digital creation is a missed opportunity that forces a paper workflow.
- **Fax delivery restricted to "Providers Only"** — patients cannot receive records by fax, though email and Direct Address are available as electronic delivery alternatives.

## Notable Strengths

- **Companion instruction guide** (form-3.pdf) is a rare patient-friendly resource that explains each section with plain-language examples (e.g., "Inpatient: Admitted for treatment or surgery with overnight stay in hospital").
- **"Purpose is not required for patient access"** — an unusually clear inline acknowledgment of HIPAA rights.
- **Email and Direct Address delivery options** demonstrate awareness of digital access preferences.
- **Anti-conditioning statement** explicitly states UPMC will not condition treatment on signing.
- **Oral authorization provision** for patients physically unable to sign, with two-witness requirements.

## Overall Assessment

UPMC Presbyterian provides an accessible, findable ROI form with some genuinely patient-friendly features — particularly the companion guide and the "purpose not required" note. However, the organization funnels all record requests through a single generic authorization form that was designed for third-party release, lacks interactive form fields despite being born-digital, and uses ambiguous fee language that doesn't clearly distinguish patient access rights. The result is a process that a motivated patient can navigate but that was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. For a major academic health system, the lack of any digital-first submission pathway (online portal, fillable PDF, or web form) is a notable gap.

# Garfield Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Garfield Medical Center (GMC), a for-profit community hospital in Monterey Park, CA, operated by AHMC Healthcare Inc., provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URL paths on the AHMC website. Neither form is specifically designed for patient self-access; both are general-purpose "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" documents that serve third-party release and personal use alike.

## Access Pathway

GMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient requesting their own records must use the same authorization form designed for release to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. The form includes "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox, and a patient could fill in their own name in the "Release To" field, but the framing is clearly oriented toward third-party disclosure ("I authorize Garfield Medical Center to Release Medical records to: Person/Organization"). There is no online portal, no digital request wizard, and no separate patient access request form.

That said, the form does include an "Inspect or Review Medical Record" option alongside copies, acknowledging the patient's right to review records in person — a positive touch that many facilities omit.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, login requirements, or browser workarounds needed. Both form versions were indexed and accessible via descriptive URLs. The only minor confusion is that two near-identical forms exist at different paths (`/gmc/documents/` and `/gmc/docs/`), both marked "Revised 9/21." A patient discovering both would have no clear way to determine which is authoritative.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — **not** a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand despite its digital origin. This is a significant missed opportunity: the form was clearly authored in a word processor but exported without interactive fields.

The layout is well-organized, following a logical flow: Patient Information → Release To → Purpose → Information to Be Released → Delivery Instructions → Notice of Rights → Term → Signature. Section headers are clear and distinct. The form offers impressive granularity in record type selection (12+ specific categories plus "ALL RECORDS") and provides multiple delivery options including email with a dedicated address field.

Language is generally accessible, using an "I understand that..." format for patient rights. However, legal references to California Health and Safety Code sections are included without plain-language explanation. The opening line — "Failure to provide all information may invalidate this authorization" — sets an intimidating tone, and it is unclear which fields are truly mandatory.

## Barriers & Concerns

- **CD liability waiver bundled into authorization:** All patients must waive liability for CD release as part of signing the form, even when not requesting imaging on CD. This is consent bundling.
- **Fees disclosed without amounts:** The form references California fee statutes but provides no specific costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate expenses.
- **Revocation limited to postal mail:** Revoking authorization requires a signed letter mailed to the Privacy Officer — no fax, email, or in-person option.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive absence.
- **Submission methods:** The form lists fax (626-307-2186), mail, email, pick-up, and hand delivery. Fax and email availability mean a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery option** with a dedicated field — uncommon among ROI forms.
- **"Inspect or Review" checkbox** alongside copies — acknowledges the HIPAA right to review.
- **Granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control.
- **Clear treatment non-conditionality statement** and 180-day expiration with patient override.

## Overall Assessment

Garfield Medical Center provides a reasonably well-structured authorization form that is easy to find and offers useful features like email delivery and record type granularity. However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form, lacking fillable fields, and bundling a CD liability waiver. The absence of a dedicated patient access pathway and the non-fillable PDF format are the most significant gaps. The facility meets the baseline for electronic submission (fax and email are available) but offers no modern digital workflow.

# UCSF Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UCSF Medical Center offers a single ROI form — the "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (756-020Zi, Rev. 04/22) — available in both English and Spanish. Two English PDF URLs exist (form-1 and form-2 contain identical text; form-2 at `/pdf/roi-authorization.pdf` is the current canonical version linked from the Medical Records page). The Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 05/22) is also directly linked. The UCSF Health Medical Records page (`ucsfhealth.org/medical-records`) additionally mentions MyChart as an alternative pathway for accessing records and discloses fees ($0.25/page paper, $25 electronic).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

UCSF does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. The authorization form is a general-purpose release designed for any disclosure — from continuity of care to billing to third-party requests. A patient wanting their own records must fill in both the "I authorize [source]" and "to release health information to [recipient]" fields, effectively authorizing release *to themselves*. While "At the request of the patient/patient representative" is available as a purpose checkbox, the form makes no distinction between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party requesting records. There is no mention of HIPAA's individual access right, no response-time commitment, and no EHI export option. MyChart provides a separate digital pathway, but the PDF form is the primary documented process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. The first web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link. The UCSF Health website has a clean, well-organized Medical Records page that links to both language versions, describes the process, and discloses fees. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-only rendering was encountered. The only minor wrinkle is two English URLs serving essentially identical PDFs, which could confuse a patient who finds the older link via search.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-crafted, digitally-authored 2-page PDF** with 39 fillable interactive fields. It is not a scan — it has a clean text layer, uses 14 fonts, and includes no embedded images. An accessibility note ("Made accessible 12/18" on form-1; "Made accessible 7/23" on form-3) confirms deliberate remediation for assistive technology. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → source/destination → purpose → record types → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Parenthetical examples for each record type (e.g., "Entire Hospital Record (e.g. History and physical, consult, operative report, discharge summary…)") help patients understand their options. The sensitive-information section correctly requires separate opt-in for substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing records, with California statute citations.

However, there are quality issues: a typo ("specifcally") appears in both English versions, and the Spanish version has three spelling errors ("fnalidad," "específca," "tratatmiento") plus a missing radiology request section that exists in the English versions — a meaningful content gap for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no excessive barriers**: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person submission mandate. Fees are disclosed on the website (not the form) at $0.25/page or $25 electronic — within HIPAA limits. The "Your Rights" section clearly states the authorization is voluntary, explains revocation rights, and notes the right to a copy.

The primary submission gap is that **general (non-radiology) requests must be mailed** to physical addresses in San Francisco or Oakland. Only radiology requests have fax and email submission options. The form itself provides no electronic submission path for general authorizations, creating a workflow disconnect: a patient can fill the form digitally but must then print and mail it.

## Overall Assessment

UCSF Medical Center earns credit for form findability, document quality, Spanish-language availability, and clean sensitive-information handling. The main weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients navigate a generic third-party release form), the mail-only submission requirement for general requests, and quality control gaps in the Spanish translation. The org demonstrates institutional attention to accessibility and transparency, but has not yet designed its records request process around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Providence St. Vincent Medical Center does not publish facility-specific ROI forms. All record request forms are managed at the parent system level by Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), a major nonprofit health system spanning seven states. Three overlapping forms were found on the Providence HIM page:

1. **Form-1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" (ORC 240A, rev. 03/20): A general-purpose ROI authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Includes a "Self" checkbox but is framed around disclosure to others.
2. **Form-2** — "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" (940507, dated 3/27/25): A dedicated patient access form with updated PSJH branding and R1RCM vendor contact info. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
3. **Form-3** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" (rev. 03/20): An older OR/MT-specific patient access form that form-2 appears to supersede, with outdated PH&S branding and contact information.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence meaningfully distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Form-2 is explicitly titled as a "Patient Request to Access" and defaults to disclosure "to Myself" as the first option. This is a genuine dedicated patient access form — not a generic authorization repurposed with a self-access checkbox. However, the general authorization (form-1) is more easily found via web search, meaning a patient may encounter the less appropriate form first. The HIM page does not clearly guide patients toward form-2 over form-1.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required pivoting from the facility name to the parent system. A search for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center" did not surface ROI forms directly — searchers had to navigate to the system-level HIM page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management`. Once found, this page is comprehensive, listing multiple forms with instructions. However, the presence of three overlapping forms with no clear guidance on which is current creates confusion. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2, the primary patient access form, is a well-constructed digital document. At 3 pages and 72 fillable fields, it is genuinely interactive — patients can complete nearly every field digitally before printing for signature. The layout uses clearly labeled sections (patient information, use and disclosure, record type selection, rights statement, signature) with capitalized headers. Record type options are helpfully tiered: "Pertinent information" (with an explanatory list of common record types) versus "All/Entire Medical Record," plus an "Other" field and "Last two years only" option.

The language is mostly clear, though the title uses the HIPAA term "Designated Record Set" rather than plain-language alternatives. The opening warning — "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — is somewhat intimidating without clarifying which fields are required versus optional.

Five delivery options are offered: MyChart, Paper (Mailed), CD (Mailed), FAX, and Email. Including MyChart is a notable patient-friendly touch. Submission can be made by mail, email (ROIHIMreception@r1rcm.com), or fax — no in-person visit is required.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable barrier is the wet-signature requirement on forms 1 and 3, though form-2 may accept electronic signatures (it lacks the explicit "Print form and sign by hand" instruction found on the others). Fees are disclosed vaguely — "there may be a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access.

A potential red flag appears in form-2's internal "HOSPITAL USE ONLY" section, which includes a physician approval/denial workflow for record release. Under HIPAA § 164.524, denial of patient access is permitted only in narrow circumstances; a blanket physician-approval gate could constitute an unreasonable barrier if applied broadly.

The continued publication of the outdated form-3 alongside form-2, with different contact information and organizational branding, risks sending patients to non-functional channels.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from general third-party authorization
- **72 fillable interactive fields** on the primary form — genuinely digital-first design
- **Five delivery format options** including MyChart and email
- **Multilingual language assistance notices** in English, Spanish, and Chinese
- **Multiple submission channels** (mail, email, fax) with no in-person requirement
- **Comprehensive HIM page** with centralized ROI processing

## Overall Assessment

Providence St. Vincent, through its parent system, provides an above-average patient record request experience. The existence of a dedicated patient access form with strong digital fillability and multiple delivery options demonstrates genuine attention to patient needs. The main weaknesses are findability (requiring navigation from facility to system-level resources), form proliferation without clear versioning guidance, vague fee disclosures, and the physician-approval gate embedded in form-2's workflow. A patient who finds form-2 will have a good experience; the challenge is ensuring they find it.

# University of Texas Medical Branch — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UTMB provides three downloaded documents, but the most important distinction is between two form types: **Form 7033** ("Patients Request for Medical Records," form-1.pdf, dated April 2023) is a dedicated patient self-request form, while **Form 7032** (form-2.pdf, revised May 2024) is a general HIPAA authorization for third-party release. A third document (form-3.pdf) is an outdated 2016 version of Form 7032 hosted by Champion Records Service, a third-party ROI vendor. For a patient requesting their own records, **Form 7033 is the relevant document**.

UTMB also offers an online portal through Datavant/Swellbox as a digital alternative to the paper forms, and the medical records page references this option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UTMB earns genuine credit for maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access versus third-party release** — a design choice that relatively few organizations make. Form 7033 omits irrelevant fields (purpose of request, representative documentation requirements) and adds patient-relevant features (MyChart delivery, email delivery, email encryption disclosure). Form 7032, by contrast, has only a "Signature of Authorized Personal Representative" line with no patient signature option, and requires documentation of authority to act on the patient's behalf. This structural separation demonstrates intentional consideration of the patient self-request use case.

However, the forms do not cross-reference each other. A patient who finds Form 7032 (whether on UTMB's site or the third-party copy) has no indication that the more appropriate Form 7033 exists.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy to moderate**. A single web search surfaced UTMB's medical records page at `utmb.edu/utmbhealth/online-services/medical-records`, which lists forms with download links under a logical "Online Services > Request Medical Records" navigation path. The complication is that PDFs are hosted on SharePoint (`liveutmb.sharepoint.com`), which requires browser-based download — programmatic access (curl) returns login pages. For a typical patient using a web browser, this is a non-issue.

## Form Document Quality

Form 7033 is a **single-page, text-based PDF** with a clean text layer (no OCR artifacts, not an image scan). It flows logically: patient identification → recipient/delivery method → record scope → expiration → signature → submission instructions. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all fields must be completed by hand after printing or via PDF annotation tools. This is the primary technical shortcoming.

The form offers **four delivery options** for records: mail, fax, email, and MyChart Patient Portal. It also provides **three submission methods** for the form itself: mail, fax, and email (himrio@utmb.edu). The email submission option is a notable convenience that eliminates the need for a printer or fax machine.

Language is generally clear and functional, though institutional rather than warm. The email encryption risk disclosure is a model of transparent, plain-language communication. The form asks for approximately 10–12 fields (name, address, DOB, phone, recipient info, record scope, dates, signature).

## Barriers and Gaps

- **No fillable fields**: Despite digital distribution, the form cannot be completed electronically in standard PDF readers.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. HIPAA limits patient access fees to a reasonable, cost-based amount, but patients have no idea what to expect.
- **No turnaround time stated**: No response timeline is communicated.
- **No patient rights statement**: The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access or explain patient rights.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records are authorized in a single blanket statement with no opt-out mechanism for individual categories.
- **No multilingual support**: Notable for a Galveston, TX institution serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — email, fax, and mail are all available.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-request form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **MyChart portal delivery option** on the authorization form itself — few organizations integrate portal delivery directly into their ROI form.
- **Email submission** of the completed form at himrio@utmb.edu — lowers the barrier significantly.
- **Transparent email encryption disclosure** — clearly written, appropriately informative without being alarming.
- **Datavant/Swellbox online portal** as a digital alternative pathway.

## Overall Assessment

UTMB demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its structural decision to maintain separate patient and third-party forms, and through the variety of delivery and submission options. The organization clearly thought about the patient self-access use case. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (undermining the digital workflow), absence of fee/rights/turnaround information, and no multilingual support. The availability of email submission and an online portal partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF. Overall, UTMB earns a **B grade** — meaningfully better than average, with room for improvement in document interactivity and patient education.

# Yale New Haven Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH), a major teaching hospital in New Haven, CT, is part of the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS). For medical records requests, YNHH uses a system-wide fillable PDF form titled "Authorization for Access/Release of Information" (Form F4918Eng, dated 07/19). A second form exists for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, another YNHHS facility, but it is not the primary form for YNHH patients. The assessment below focuses on Form 1 as the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records from Yale New Haven Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient-Friendly Features

YNHH does not offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from its third-party release authorization. The single system-wide form serves both purposes. However, the form makes notable accommodations for patient self-access: the title includes the word "Access" (not just "Release"), "Personal use" is listed as the first purpose option, and the form supports bidirectional requests (both "RELEASE information TO" and "OBTAIN information FROM"). Despite these touches, the underlying structure is a generic HIPAA authorization. A patient requesting their own records must designate themselves as the "recipient" — an awkward fit that reveals the form's third-party-release DNA. The form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or frame the request as an exercise of the patient's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search immediately surfaced it on the YNHHS parent system website, which hosts a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page with direct PDF download links. No login, account creation, or bot-blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on ynhhs.org (parent system) rather than ynhh.org (hospital), which is logical but could cause mild confusion for patients starting at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

Form 1 is an impressive digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 97 interactive form fields — one of the highest counts in the study. Every data-entry point appears to have an interactive field, enabling patients to complete the form entirely on-screen before printing for signature. The two-page layout follows a logical flow: patient identity → purpose → recipient → delivery method → facility/visit selection → date range → record types → sensitive information exclusions → legal disclosures → submission instructions → signature. Sections are clearly delineated and the form is dense but functional.

The language is mostly clear in the data-entry sections but shifts to dense legal prose in the "I understand that" statements on page 2. The minor consent paragraph is particularly complex, with nested age thresholds under Connecticut state law. The sensitive information section uses an opt-out model (all sensitive records released unless the patient initials specific exclusions), which is patient-friendly in intent but uses double-negative framing that could confuse.

## Submission and Delivery

The form offers robust submission options: mail (PO Box 9565, New Haven), fax (203-688-4645), and three email addresses differentiated by entity (Hospital, NEMG, Yale Medicine). This flexibility is a genuine strength — patients can submit electronically without visiting the facility.

For delivery, five options are available: MyChart portal (requiring an active account), mail, fax, secure email, and pick-up. MyChart delivery is a standout feature that most ROI forms lack, offering an end-to-end electronic pathway for records receipt.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The authorization is valid for one year, and revocation rights are clearly explained. The voluntariness statement is explicit: treatment is not conditioned on signing.

The main compliance gap is ambiguous fee language. "Reasonable cost-based fees apply" appears next to radiology images, while "There may be a charge for copies in accordance with Connecticut law" appears in the legal section. Neither amount is disclosed, and the form does not clarify whether the HIPAA cost-based fee ceiling applies when a patient requests their own records. The turnaround commitment of 10 business days is explicit and well within HIPAA's 30-day limit.

## Notable Strengths

- **97 fillable fields** — exceptionally high digital-first form design
- **MyChart delivery** — electronic records receipt via patient portal
- **Multiple submission channels** — three email addresses, fax, and mail
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific categories plus complete record option
- **10-business-day turnaround commitment** with a customer service phone number

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as third-party requesters
- **Wet signature required** — breaks the digital workflow (fill → print → sign → scan → email)
- **Fee language is ambiguous** — does not distinguish patient-access fees from third-party fees
- **Form last updated July 2019** — nearly seven years old, may not reflect current policies
- **No multilingual versions found**

## Overall Assessment

Yale New Haven Hospital provides a competent, digitally mature records request experience that falls short of true patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF, multiple submission/delivery options, and MyChart integration demonstrate genuine investment in accessibility. However, the organization has not taken the step of creating a distinct patient access pathway — patients must navigate a dual-purpose authorization form designed primarily for third-party release. The result is a solid B-level experience: functional and mostly friction-free, but not designed around the patient's perspective.

# Southeast Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Southeast Medical Group (SEMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Alpharetta, Georgia. SEMG does not publish its own standalone Release of Information form. Instead, it outsources the entire records-request process to **MediCopy**, a third-party health information management vendor. Four documents were retrieved during the evaluation: two versions of MediCopy's generic ROI authorization form (2023 and 2020), an SEMG patient portal proxy authorization form, and SEMG's multi-page patient registration packet. Only the MediCopy authorization forms are relevant to a patient requesting their own records.

## Pathways Available

The patient journey for requesting records begins at SEMG's website. The Resources section includes a "Medical Records" area with a "Request Records" link, which redirects through `semg.link/med-records` to **medicopy.net/patients** — a third-party site with no SEMG branding. From there, patients can either download a PDF authorization form or use MediCopy's HelloSign-based online authorization wizard. SEMG's FAQ also provides an email address (medicalrecords@southeastmedicalgroup.com) as a contact point for records requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SEMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The MediCopy authorization form is a generic instrument that treats every request identically — whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney is requesting them. "Personal Use" is listed among five purpose-of-disclosure options, but there is no separate pathway, form, or instructions for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The form asks patients to fill in both a source facility and a recipient, requiring a self-requesting patient to effectively provide their own contact information twice. No mention is made of patient-specific rights, fee limits, or the distinct legal framework that applies to individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. Direct searches for SEMG-specific ROI forms on the SEMG website and via Google yielded nothing — the forms page lists 10 patient forms but no ROI authorization. The FAQ answer for "How can I get a copy of my medical record?" is helpful, providing a direct link to MediCopy and an email address. However, a patient who bypasses the FAQ and navigates to the forms page would find no relevant document. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during retrieval. The redirect chain to a third-party site introduces an element of confusion — a patient clicking "Request Records" lands on a MediCopy page with no mention of SEMG.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (MediCopy 2023 authorization, form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. Despite being digitally authored, it has **zero fillable form fields** — patients must print and handwrite all information. The layout is well-organized, following a logical top-down flow: source facility → patient demographics → recipient → record types → purpose → delivery method → signature. Section headers use plain, conversational language ("Tell us about the patient," "How would you like the records sent?"), which is notably more approachable than typical ROI forms. The authorization paragraph is a single block of standard legal text covering validity, revocation, re-disclosure, and no-conditioning — dense but not unreasonably so.

The form offers good granularity for record-type selection (11 options including date ranges and "Other") and an opt-out exclusion model for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/STDs, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postal mail.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and creates unnecessary identity theft risk. **No submission instructions**: The form itself contains no address, fax number, email, or portal link for returning the completed authorization — a patient who downloads the PDF in isolation has no way to know where to send it. **Fee opacity**: The form notes "additional fee applies" for postal delivery but provides no dollar amounts for any delivery method. More concerning, SEMG's registration packet (form-4) discloses an Administrative Service Fee structure of $10–$150 per form, with "immunization records" listed as an example — this broad language could encompass patient access requests and would likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based fee limits.

## Notable Strengths

The plain-language section headers and sensitive-record exclusion options are genuine bright spots in form design. MediCopy's availability of an online HelloSign authorization provides a fully digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF. The FAQ's direct answer about records requests, including both a link and an email address, is more helpful than many practices' web presences. SEMG's registration form also includes modern patient-centered fields for preferred language and pronouns.

## Overall Assessment

SEMG provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records requests. The outsourcing to MediCopy means patients interact with a generic vendor form that was not designed around patient self-access. The form's content design is above average thanks to plain language and logical organization, but technical limitations (non-fillable PDF, missing submission instructions) and compliance gaps (SSN collection, fee ambiguity) weigh it down. The organization earns a middling assessment: records are obtainable, but the process was clearly not designed with the individual patient in mind.

# Natividad Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Natividad Medical Center, a government-owned community hospital in Salinas, CA, hosts two ROI authorization forms on its medical records page at `https://www.natividad.com/medical-records/`:

- **Form 1** (2019): A 1-page "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — an image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields. Despite being the newer version, it is a grayscale scan at 200 DPI that cannot be read by screen readers or completed digitally.
- **Form 2** (2007): A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" created from Microsoft Word. It has a text layer but is copy-protected (RC4 encryption) and also lacks fillable fields. It requests Social Security Number and contains a garbled legal citation.

Both forms serve the same general purpose — authorizing release of health information — and both remain linked from the website with no guidance on which is current or preferred.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. However, Form 1 does include explicit patient access language: "If you are the patient requesting your own records, you may choose between printed copies or CD." It also includes a "Patient" checkbox among requester roles. Form 2 has a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose but is structurally oriented toward third-party release, requiring the patient to name a "release to" recipient — awkward when requesting one's own records.

The organization does not differentiate individual access from third-party authorization through separate forms, sections, or pathways. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. A general web search for medical records release forms surfaced both PDFs, and a site-specific search confirmed the medical records page. The presence of two overlapping forms with unclear currency creates confusion — a patient finding both would not know which to use. The filename "Auth_ROI_e.pdf" for Form 2 is cryptic and unhelpful. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form is fillable — both require printing and completion by hand. Form 1's image-only format makes it completely inaccessible to assistive technology, likely violating Section 508 and WCAG standards for a government facility. Form 2's text layer is an improvement but copy-protection prevents text selection. Both forms use underscore-line blanks for data entry.

Form 1 packs substantial content onto a single page with cramped layout. Section headings exist but are not strongly differentiated from body text in the scanned format. Form 2 is better organized with clear section headers (USE AND DISCLOSURE, PURPOSE, EXPIRATION, MY RIGHTS, SIGNATURE) and logical flow across two pages, though footnotes descend into dense legal prose.

Language is generally plain in both forms, though both include legal phrasing that may challenge patients with limited health literacy. Neither form provides clear instructions for completion.

## Barriers

- **No electronic submission pathway documented**: Neither form specifies how to submit — no fax number, email address, or portal is mentioned. The forms only address what information to release, not how to submit the request.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate charges.
- **Outdated delivery options**: Form 1 states "Natividad policy is to provide all electronic records on a CD" — CDs are increasingly obsolete, and this may functionally limit patients' right to receive records electronically.
- **SSN collection** (Form 2): Requesting Social Security Number is unnecessary for HIPAA requests and creates identity-theft risk.
- **Blank revocation address** (Form 2): The form instructs patients to submit revocations "to the following address" but leaves the address blank.

## Bright Spots

- Form 1 explicitly addresses patients requesting their own records and offers format choices.
- Form 1's opt-out exclusion model (defaulting to full disclosure with options to exclude HIV, substance abuse, mental health records) is patient-friendly.
- Form 1 dropped the SSN requirement present in Form 2, showing incremental improvement.
- Both forms include patient rights language covering refusal, no-retaliation, revocation, and right to a copy.

## Overall Assessment

Natividad Medical Center provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly maintained patient access experience. The organization relies on generic third-party authorization forms rather than a dedicated patient access pathway. The newer form (2019) is paradoxically less accessible than the older one (2007) due to its image-only scan format — a regression in digital accessibility. Neither form is fillable, no electronic submission method is documented, and the dual-form situation with no guidance creates unnecessary confusion. For a government-owned facility, the accessibility failures are particularly concerning. The org earns a **C grade**, reflecting a process that technically exists but was not designed with patient self-access in mind.

# WakeMed Health & Hospitals — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

WakeMed Health & Hospitals provides a single ROI authorization form ("Authorization to Release Medical Information," N-935, revised 11/25) available in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf, N-935S). These are the same form translated — not separate documents for different purposes. Both are linked from the Health Information Management (HIM) page under Patients and Visitors → Medical Records. There is no online portal, no web-based request wizard, and no dedicated patient-access form. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it by hand, and submitting via email (HIMROI@Wakemed.org), fax (919-350-1720), or mail.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

WakeMed does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization that covers both releasing and obtaining PHI. A patient requesting their own records selects "Personal" from a list of five purposes (Billing/Insurance, Patient Care, Personal, Legal, Other) and must fill in a "Recipient" field — a concept that doesn't map cleanly when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form asks for the name of the "Person, Organization, or Facility you want us to release your PHI to," which creates an awkward fit for a simple "send me my records" request. This is a generic_hipaa_auth pathway, not a patient-centric design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A web search for WakeMed's ROI authorization immediately surfaced the correct page. The only friction was that an older URL (/assets/documents/...) was stale and returned HTML, requiring navigation to the HIM page to locate the current PDF links under /sites/default/files/pdf/. Once there, both language versions are clearly labeled and downloadable without bot blocking or access restrictions. Difficulty: moderate — easy via search, but required one redirect.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. Checkboxes are rendered as the letter "o" in text, and blanks are underscores — a purely print-and-handwrite design. The form has a text layer (not an image scan), so the content is readable on screen, but a patient cannot complete it digitally without third-party annotation tools.

Layout and organization are strong points. The 2-page form flows logically: patient/recipient information → record types and date ranges → format and delivery preferences (page 1), then understanding/consent → authorization/signature → revocation → contact information (page 2). Section headers are bold and uppercase. Record type selection is granular, with specific options for office visits, hospital admissions, ED visits, imaging studies, and sub-components like discharge summaries and lab reports. The date-of-visit field is flexibly worded ("Specify the date, date range, or other specific description of your visit").

Language is reasonably plain, though the UNDERSTANDING section on page 2 leans toward legal formality with a series of "I understand..." statements. These are necessary disclosures (re-disclosure risk, revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment) but add density.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No unnecessary barriers**: No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission. Multiple electronic submission channels (email and fax). Identity verification is mentioned but framed permissively ("proof of my identity... may be requested").

**Fee disclosure is vague**: The form warns that "any and/or all" requests and large-volume requests are processed by WakeMed's copy service and "a fee will be charged," but provides no schedule, estimate, or reference to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based standard. A patient cannot predict costs before submitting.

**Notable bright spots**: (1) A Spanish-language version exists — uncommon in this study — though it has translation gaps, with key field labels ("Address where you want your PHI sent to," "Email address") remaining in English. (2) Six delivery methods are offered: mail, fax, pick up, onsite review, MyChart (for records after 2/1/2015), and email with encrypted delivery as the default. (3) Email submission of the form itself removes a significant access barrier. (4) The form was recently revised (11/25), suggesting active maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

WakeMed provides a competent, well-organized ROI form with multiple submission and delivery channels, a Spanish translation, and no major procedural barriers. Its primary weakness is the lack of a patient-centric access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization form designed for all disclosure purposes, and the non-fillable PDF format forces a print-and-handwrite workflow. The form is adequate for its purpose but falls short of best practice in digital accessibility and patient-centeredness. Grade: **B** (3.50).

# Valleywise Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valleywise Health Medical Center, a government-owned independent community hospital in Phoenix, AZ, provides a notably patient-centered approach to medical records access. The organization maintains two distinct PDF forms: a general third-party authorization (Form 43439) and a dedicated patient access request form (Form 45643). This two-form architecture is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement, clearly separating patient self-access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Valleywise Health is among the organizations that get this right. Form 45643 — "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — is explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It does not require the patient to name a third-party recipient, does not include a purpose/reason field, and does not carry an expiration clause — all appropriate design choices for a one-time patient access request. Meanwhile, Form 43439 handles third-party disclosures with the appropriate authorization infrastructure (recipient designation, purpose selection, expiration, revocation rights). The organizational intent to differentiate is clear and well-executed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` returned direct PDF URLs. The organization's patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` also links to the forms. Both PDFs were publicly accessible from a standard WordPress media directory with no bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication. The descriptive filenames (e.g., `Form-45643-Patient-Request-For-Access-To-Protected-Health-Information_ENG_SPA.pdf`) make it clear which form is which.

## Form Document Quality

Form 45643 is a 2-page bilingual PDF (English page 1, full Spanish translation page 2). The layout is clean with a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection → date range → delivery format → recipient information → processing details → signature. The form offers an impressively granular record type selection with 16+ specific categories (discharge summary, H&P, nursing notes, operative reports, pathology, radiology, etc.) plus an "All Records" option. Delivery options include MyChart patient portal, paper copy, CD, USB, email, and fax.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a digitally-authored document. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the form's clean layout would translate well to interactive PDF fields. Submission is available via fax (602-655-9017) and email (ROI@valleywisehealth.org), providing adequate electronic pathways, but the print-and-handwrite step creates friction in an otherwise well-designed process.

The language is plain and accessible throughout, with clear instructions ("Please check (✔) the appropriate box(es) (❑) and fill in the blank(s) as needed") and a patient-friendly tone ("We appreciate your patience while we process your request").

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization, witness, or in-person requirements exist. The form states a HIPAA-compliant 30-day response timeline with a possible 30-day extension. Fee disclosure is vague — "Valleywise Health may charge a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing a fee schedule, though the language about "actual cost of the portable media" aligns with HIPAA's cost-based limits.

Two concerns stand out. First, the form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient access requests and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed or emailed. Second, the Spanish translation references "documento 43780" instead of the correct Form 43439, potentially sending Spanish-speaking patients searching for a nonexistent form.

## Notable Strengths

The standout features are the **full bilingual (English/Spanish) form** — not a summary but a complete parallel translation, appropriate for Phoenix's demographics — the **dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release, and the **granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control over their request scope. The email encryption transparency, defaulting to encryption with an informed opt-out, is a thoughtful touch.

## Overall Assessment

Valleywise Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its medical records access process. The dedicated patient access form, bilingual design, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options reflect genuine attention to the patient experience. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a paper-first completion workflow despite otherwise modern design sensibilities. The SSN field and Spanish-version cross-reference error are notable but secondary concerns. This is a well-designed system with room for straightforward technical improvements.

# Riverside Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Riverside Community Hospital, an HCA Healthcare facility in Riverside, CA, provides three downloadable authorization forms for medical records release. **Form-2** (English, 1 page, 52 fillable fields) is the current official document, linked directly from the hospital's [medical records page](https://www.riversidecommunityhospital.com/patient-resources/medical-records). **Form-3** is a Spanish-language equivalent with identical structure and field count. **Form-1** is an older, 5-page non-fillable version hosted by a third-party ROI vendor (Legal Image) that is no longer linked from the hospital's website. The retrieval notes also mention a MyHealthONE patient portal and a Swellbox-based online request wizard, though the PDF forms remain the primary documented pathway.

## Patient Self-Access vs. Third-Party Release

Riverside Community Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization for Release of PHI" documents designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-2 does include a checkbox distinguishing "At the request of the individual" from "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form's overall structure still centers on designating a separate "Recipient" — a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own name and address as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 (right of access), no mention of the 30-day response deadline for patient access requests, and no distinction in fee treatment between patient access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HCA corporate template (HCA-840-00434), not something designed with the patient self-request experience in mind.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy** — the medical records page is accessible within 1-2 clicks from the main website under Patient Resources. Both English and Spanish forms are directly linked as downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that form-1 is served over HTTP (not HTTPS) by the third-party vendor, but this is not the primary form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is technically strong. It is a genuinely digital-first, fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields — checkboxes, radio buttons, and text fields — all on a single page. A patient can complete the form on-screen without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (A: authorization details, B: marketing/PHI sale, C: signatures), with 16 granular record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. The language is formal and clinical but generally comprehensible. However, the single-page format makes the form quite dense, and there are no standalone instructions or guidance text on the form itself (unlike form-1's two-page instruction set). The USCDI release request option is a rare and forward-looking inclusion, though the technical jargon ("Requires Direct Address or National Provider Identifier") would be meaningless to most patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. No notarization or witness signature is required. Submission can be made by mail (to HCA's Nashville, TN processing center) or by fax, satisfying the baseline for electronic submission. The SSN field is present but marked optional. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("a reasonable copy fee") without specifying amounts or distinguishing patient access from third-party release. No response time commitment is stated. The centralized Nashville mailing address means local submission is not mentioned on the current form, though a patient could potentially submit in person at the hospital's HIM department.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language parity**: Form-3 is a fully equivalent Spanish version with the same 52 fillable fields — genuine language access for Riverside's majority-Hispanic community.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare among ROI forms and signals awareness of interoperability standards.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure).
- **52 fillable fields**: Among the most technically complete fillable forms observed.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Patients are funneled through the same generic authorization form used for insurance companies and attorneys.
- **No right-of-access language**: The form never informs patients of their HIPAA right to access their own records or the associated protections (fee limits, 30-day timeline).
- **Centralized processing**: All requests route to Nashville, TN — no local submission address on the current form.
- **Grammar error persists**: "obtain a copy the information" (missing "of") appears across all form versions.

## Overall Assessment

Riverside Community Hospital delivers a technically competent but patient-generic records request experience. The fillable PDF, Spanish-language version, and multiple delivery options represent genuine strengths. However, the organization treats patient self-access as just another type of third-party release, missing an opportunity to provide a streamlined, patient-centered pathway. A patient can get their records through this process, but they receive no guidance tailored to their situation and may not understand their rights. The overall experience earns a **B** — solid technical execution held back by a one-size-fits-all approach to records access.

# Nevada Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Nevada Health Centers (NHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Carson City, NV. The organization publishes three ROI-related forms on a well-organized patient forms page. All three are bilingual English/Spanish PDFs created in Adobe Illustrator, and none have fillable fields or an extractable text layer. The primary form for patient self-access is a general-purpose "Release of Medical Information" authorization — there is no dedicated patient access request form.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved from the forms page at `nevadahealthcenters.org/forms/`:

1. **Form-1** — "Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). This is the primary general-purpose release form, covering both patient-initiated requests and third-party releases via a "To/From" checkbox. It is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.
2. **Form-2** — "Authorization to Share Information" (2 pages, bilingual EN/ES). This is a proxy access designation form allowing patients to authorize family or friends to access information on their behalf. It does *not* serve patient self-access.
3. **Form-3** — "WIC Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). A WIC program-specific variant of Form-1, listing seven WIC clinic locations. Structurally identical to Form-1 with added clinic details.

The organization directs completed forms to its Support Services Department in Las Vegas. Fax numbers appear on the forms (and specifically on Form-3's clinic listings), and a mailing address is provided on Form-1. No online portal, email submission, or patient portal-based records request was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NHC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Form-1 uses a single "To or From" directional checkbox to handle both scenarios. A patient requesting their own records would check "To" (themselves) and provide their own contact information in the recipient fields — but the form's language and structure are oriented toward third-party release, asking for a recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524, the Right of Access, or any patient rights language beyond revocation rights. The form requires a "Reason for Request" (with options including "Personal"), which HIPAA does not require for patient self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **relatively easy**. A site-scoped search (`site:nevadahealthcenters.org`) identified the forms page within 2–3 steps. The page is well-organized by category (General Forms, Dental Forms, Mammovan Forms, etc.) with clearly labeled PDF links. However, generic web searches did not surface NHC-specific forms — results returned other Nevada healthcare organizations instead. A patient would need to navigate directly to the NHC website to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a clean, single-page design that packs bilingual content, multiple checkbox sections, and a signature block into a reasonably organized layout. The top-to-bottom flow is logical: patient identification → direction of release → record types → date range → confidential information → reason → signature.

However, significant technical and design issues undermine usability:

- **No fillable fields and no text layer**: All three PDFs were created in Adobe Illustrator with text rendered as vector paths. They have zero extractable text, zero embedded fonts, and zero interactive fields. Screen readers cannot read them, text cannot be copied or searched, and every field must be hand-filled after printing. This is an especially unfortunate choice because the documents are born-digital (not scans) — a word processor or PDF form tool would have preserved accessibility.
- **No "All Records" checkbox**: The form offers six specific record categories plus "Other" but lacks an option to request a complete record. A patient exercising their Right of Access to their full designated record set must check every box and potentially write additional categories.
- **Ambiguous witness line**: The signature block includes a "Witness" field without indicating whether it is required or optional, potentially creating a perceived barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **Inline bilingual compression**: English and Spanish share space on a single page, which keeps things concise but subordinates the Spanish text and reduces whitespace.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers**: No notarization is required. No fees are mentioned (neither disclosed nor explicitly waived). The 120-day default expiration is reasonable but on the shorter side. The witness field ambiguity is a minor concern. The primary barriers are technical: the completely non-digital workflow (print, handwrite, fax/mail) and the inaccessible PDF format.

**Bright spots**: The bilingual English/Spanish design across all three forms is a genuine strength for this FQHC's patient population. The granular confidential information opt-in/opt-out section (AIDS/HIV, behavioral health, alcohol/drug, social services) gives patients meaningful control over sensitive categories. The single-page form length is appropriately concise.

## Overall Assessment

Nevada Health Centers provides a findable, bilingual, concisely designed release form that a patient *can* use to request their own records — but the process was not designed with patient self-access in mind. The generic authorization form, the print-only workflow, and the complete lack of digital accessibility represent a paper-era approach that creates unnecessary friction. The organization earns credit for easy findability and inclusive bilingual design, but loses ground on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness. Overall grade: **C**.

# Pocahontas Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Pocahontas Memorial Hospital (PMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Buckeye, West Virginia. Two PDF forms were found on the hospital's Medical Records page: a general-purpose **Authorization for Release of Medical Information** (form-1, 2 pages) and a narrowly scoped **COVID-19 Testing Authorization** (form-2, 1 page). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own records; form-2 is a pandemic-era authorization for releasing COVID test results to employers or schools.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Form

PMH does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole route for a patient requesting their own records is the generic HIPAA authorization form (form-1), which is designed to handle all release scenarios — personal use, insurance, attorneys, and other third parties. The form does include "Personal use" as the first option under Purpose of Disclosure, and a patient can name themselves as the recipient, but the overall structure (recipient fields, entity authorization, third-party delivery options) is oriented toward release to others. There is no separate patient access request form, online portal, or patient portal–based request workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A general web search for PMH authorization forms returned generic template sites rather than the hospital's own link. A site-scoped search (`site:pmhwv.org`) succeeded, and the form is linked from a logical location: Patients and Visitors > Medical Records. Bot protection on the website blocked direct programmatic (curl) downloads, requiring a browser-based workaround. A patient navigating the website directly would find the form in 2–3 clicks, which is reasonable for a small facility.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring the patient to print and handwrite. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, record type selection (about 10 checkbox options), date range, sensitive information opt-outs, purpose of disclosure, recipient information, and delivery preferences. The logical flow is sensible: patient info → what to release → purpose → recipient → delivery → authorization → signature.

Layout is functional but minimal. There are no bold section headers, boxed regions, or strong visual hierarchy beyond the document title and some capitalized labels. The sensitive information opt-out section is a dense paragraph with inline initial-lines that could be difficult to parse. Language is a mix of plain phrasing and standard legal boilerplate; the authorization paragraph on page 2 is a single dense block. A notable text encoding defect drops the "ti" ligature throughout the PDF (rendering "Patient" as "Pa ent," "authorization" as "authoriza on," etc.), which breaks screen readers and text search — a significant accessibility flaw.

## Submission Methods & Delivery Options

The form offers multiple submission and delivery options: in-person pickup (self or authorized representative), US Mail, fax (304-799-2276), and email. Format options explicitly include Paper and Electronic (email, USB, CD, Portal, other). This is a notably comprehensive set of electronic delivery options for a small critical access hospital. Since fax is available, a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Compliance

**No notarization required** — only a patient signature. The form includes a clear **non-conditioning statement** ("may not condition its providing of health care on whether copies... are released"), an unusual and commendable inclusion for a small rural facility. A **30-day response time** is stated, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Revocation and re-disclosure language are present and standard.

However, the form states **"Photo ID is required"** as a blanket requirement without clarifying whether this applies only to in-person pickup or also to mailed/faxed requests — a potential barrier for remote patients. **Fee disclosure is vague**: "All other requestors are charged as state and federal laws allow" provides no specific amounts, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. These are not dealbreakers but reflect areas where the form could better serve patients.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Electronic format options explicitly listed (email, USB, CD, Portal); multiple delivery methods; non-conditioning statement included; 30-day response time stated; logical form flow.

**Red flags**: Zero fillable fields despite being digitally created; blanket photo ID requirement; vague fee disclosure; systematic text encoding defect affecting accessibility; "Snowshoe Mountain Clinic" listed as a record type alongside clinical categories (confusing).

## Overall Assessment

PMH provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of a small independent critical access hospital. The form is findable, logically organized, and offers commendable delivery flexibility. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, zero fillable fields, and several barrier concerns prevent it from rising above average. The form adequately serves a patient who knows what they need, but it wasn't designed with the patient self-access use case as a priority.

# Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola is a community hospital in the Florida panhandle, part of the Ascension health system — one of the largest nonprofit Catholic health systems in the United States. The facility uses Ascension's market-specific forms for the Florida panhandle region rather than purely facility-level documents. Two PDF forms were found during retrieval, along with references to a Swellbox-powered online records request portal and an Ascension patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Most Relevant Form

Three pathways exist for patients requesting their own records:

1. **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary): The facility's medical records page directs patients to a Swellbox-powered online request wizard — a third-party vendor platform purpose-built for patient record requests. This is the org's preferred channel.
2. **PDF authorization form (form-1.pdf)**: A traditional single-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Information From Ascension Sacred Heart," form number FFM99-8700-010-00 (rev 8/20). This is the general-purpose ROI form covering four Ascension Sacred Heart facilities in the Florida panhandle.
3. **Ascension patient portal**: The medical records page also references the patient portal for direct record access.

A second PDF (form-2.pdf) was found but is irrelevant for patient self-access — it is a department-specific inbound records release for the Radiation Oncology department, designed for transferring records *from* other providers *to* Sacred Heart. It uses outdated "Sacred Heart Health System" branding, contains multiple typos, and dates from 2016.

**Form-1 is the most relevant downloadable document** for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does not offer a dedicated patient-access PDF form distinct from third-party authorization. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed to cover all release scenarios — patients, insurers, attorneys, and other third parties all use the same document. A patient requesting their own records must check the "Patient Named Above" box to indicate they are both the patient and recipient, and select "At the request of the patient" as the purpose. This works but requires the patient to navigate a form designed for a broader audience.

However, the Swellbox online portal serves as a de facto dedicated patient access pathway. Online records request wizards are specifically designed for patient-initiated requests, providing a more guided experience than the generic PDF form. The existence of this portal partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient-access PDF.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. The primary PDF was discovered on the first web search using standard ROI-related keywords and downloaded without any bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or browser fallback requirements. The form is hosted on Ascension's content delivery system at a stable, descriptive URL. However, a patient navigating the website organically would be directed to the Swellbox portal rather than the PDF — the downloadable form is available but not prominently linked from the website's navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

**Technical format**: The PDF has a text layer (not a scan) but zero fillable/interactive fields. All blanks are underscores — patients must print and handwrite. Despite being digitally authored with 7 embedded fonts, it was designed entirely for a print-and-fill workflow.

**Layout and organization**: The single-page form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient information → purpose → format preference → report type checkboxes → facility/date selection → sensitive information authorization → legal disclosures → signature. The checkbox layout for report types and facility selection is clean and practical.

**Language**: The upper portion uses reasonably plain language. The lower third shifts to dense legal text — the sensitive information authorization bundles HIV, AIDS, psychiatric conditions, substance abuse, sickle cell anemia, STDs, and hepatitis into a single all-or-nothing binary decision in one long sentence. The revocation rights section runs together without paragraph breaks.

**Instructions**: Minimal. There are no instructions for how or where to submit the completed form. A note warns: "If you fail to specify which records you desire, you will only receive a copy of the discharge summary" — defaulting to minimal disclosure when patients don't navigate the checkbox list correctly.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number as a standard field — unnecessary for patient access and creates identity theft risk.
- **Purpose marked "REQUIRED"**: HIPAA does not require patients to state a reason for accessing their own records, though the pre-printed "At the request of the patient" option reduces the practical burden.
- **Default to minimal records**: The discharge-summary-only default if record types aren't specified may result in patients receiving less than they're entitled to.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. Patients have no advance notice of potential fees.
- **Internal EHR navigation paths visible**: Staff-facing filing instructions appear in the form footer, suggesting the document wasn't reviewed for patient-facing use.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox online portal as primary pathway**: Directing patients to a dedicated digital request wizard is a significant positive.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: One form covers four Ascension Sacred Heart locations — patients with care across facilities don't need separate forms.
- **Electronic format option**: The form offers a choice between electronic and paper delivery, though "electronic" is undefined.
- **Concise single-page design**: All content fits on one page without excessive cramming.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola provides a **mixed but functional** experience. The organization's strength lies in offering a Swellbox online portal as the primary pathway — a genuinely patient-centered digital option. However, the fallback PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, unnecessary SSN collection, and no submission instructions. The form is easy to find but was clearly designed for institutional workflow rather than patient self-service. A patient who uses the Swellbox portal will likely have a reasonable experience; one who downloads the PDF will face a traditional print-and-mail workflow with some compliance concerns.
