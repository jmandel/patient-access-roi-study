# Document Quality Deep Dive — Batch 4

## Fillability: The Digital Divide

Of 190 organizations analyzed, only **50 (26%)** provide fillable/interactive PDFs with working form fields. The remaining **140 (74%)** offer flat, non-fillable documents — born-digital PDFs that nonetheless require patients to print and handwrite their responses, or use clunky PDF annotation workarounds. Within the non-fillable group, roughly **17 (9%)** are scanned paper forms or image-heavy documents with degraded text layers, and **5 orgs (3%)** had no retrievable ROI form at all, yielding 0-page documents with 0 fields.

Teaching hospitals lead in fillability at **40%** (12/30), while critical access hospitals trail badly at **10%** (3/29). Community hospitals (29%), physician practices (23%), and FQHCs (24%) cluster in the middle. The pattern is clear: larger, better-resourced institutions invest in interactive form fields; smaller rural facilities do not.

## Page Counts and Field Counts

The typical ROI form is remarkably compact. **98 orgs (53%)** use a single-page form; **75 (41%)** use two pages. The mean page count is **1.7 pages**. Only 5 orgs exceed 3 pages, and the extremes tell a story: **El Rio Health** (FQHC, Tucson) has a 16-page HIPAA compliance booklet that is *not actually a request form* — it describes the right to access records without providing any mechanism to exercise it. **People's Health Centers** (FQHC, St. Louis) similarly offers a 10-page Notice of Privacy Practices with no actionable form.

Field counts range from **7 to 103**, with a mean of **26.5 fields**. The distribution is right-skewed: 104 orgs (55%) have 11–20 fields, representing the generic authorization template with patient demographics, recipient, record type, and signature. At the high end, **NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital** leads with 103 fillable fields across 2 pages — covering 11 campus locations, 16+ record-type checkboxes, and granular sensitive-information consent. **Texas Oncology** (95 fields, 3 pages) and **A.O. Fox Hospital** (83 fields, 2 pages) round out the top three.

## Digital-First vs. Scanned Paper

Most forms (roughly 89%) are born-digital PDFs — created in word processors or design tools with intact text layers. However, "born-digital" does not mean "digitally usable." Canton-Potsdam Hospital's form is digitally produced but has severely garbled font encoding, making it inaccessible to screen readers and unsearchable. Many flat PDFs were clearly designed for printing: signature lines rendered as underscores, checkbox squares drawn as graphics rather than interactive elements.

True scanned paper forms are relatively rare (~9%) but concentrated among smaller facilities. Notable scan-quality problems appear at **Aaron E. Henry CHC** (Clarksdale, MS) and **Franklin Primary Health Center** (Mobile, AL) — both FQHCs where no usable form could even be retrieved. **La Clínica de la Raza** (Oakland, CA) presents a different problem: the forms retrieved were from a *different organization* with a similar name, yielding an 8-page document that doesn't belong to the facility at all.

## Layout, Typography, and Visual Design

**165 of 190 orgs (87%)** have forms with clear, logical layouts — typically a numbered section flow through patient demographics, record types, recipient information, and signatures. However, only **91 (48%)** use plain language accessible to a general audience. The gap between "organized" and "readable" is filled with dense legal paragraphs, nested parentheticals, and 100+ word sentences.

**Flowers Hospital** (Dothan, AL) stands out as the single A-graded organization: a one-page form with 66 fillable fields created in Adobe InDesign, bilingual (English/Spanish), with clear instructions — demonstrating that excellent document quality is achievable even for a mid-size community hospital. **OrthoCarolina** illustrates the opposite problem: a single-page form with reasonable content but "dense cramped layout, garbled text in the delivery section due to overlapping text boxes, and run-on legal paragraphs."

## Instructions and Multilingual Support

**82 orgs (43%)** include instructions of some kind, but quality varies enormously. Fillable forms are more likely to include instructions (64%) than non-fillable ones (36%). Huntington Hospital (Northwell Health) provides a companion instruction document with annotated visual examples and sample entries ("Jane Patient," "Dr. Jane Jones at 300 Northwell Drive") — a genuine accessibility aid that is rare across the study.

**63 orgs (33%)** offer multilingual forms. Spanish is near-universal as the second language (all 63 multilingual orgs include it). Beyond Spanish, only scattered offerings appear: Haitian Creole (3 orgs, including Broward Health and Memorial Healthcare System in South Florida), Portuguese (2), Chinese (2, including NewYork-Presbyterian), Somali (2), and Hmong (1 — Prevea Health in Green Bay, WI, reflecting its local Hmong community). FQHCs lead multilingual availability at **48%**, consistent with their mission to serve underserved and diverse populations. Critical access hospitals are the least multilingual at **10%**.

## Standout Examples

**Best craftsmanship**: Flowers Hospital — 66 fillable fields on one page, bilingual, clear instructions, professionally designed. NewYork-Presbyterian — 103 fields, trilingual (English/Spanish/Chinese), comprehensive record-type granularity. Prevea Health — single-page form in four languages (English/Hmong/Somali/Spanish), reflecting genuine community responsiveness.

**Worst craftsmanship**: Aaron E. Henry CHC and People's Health Centers — no usable form found at all. El Rio Health — a 16-page HIPAA booklet masquerading as a records access pathway. Canton-Potsdam Hospital — garbled font encoding rendering the document functionally inaccessible despite being born-digital.
