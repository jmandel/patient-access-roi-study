You are analyzing the technical and design quality of ROI form documents for a
study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city). Use this to contextualize your findings.

Your task: focus specifically on the FORM DOCUMENTS as technical artifacts. For this batch:
- How many forms are fillable/interactive PDFs vs. flat (print-and-fill) PDFs vs. image-only scans?
- What's the range of page counts and field counts?
- How many are clearly digital-first vs. scanned paper forms?
- What's the state of layout, typography, and visual design?
- Are instructions included? Are they clear?
- How common is multilingual support?
- Any notable examples of exceptionally good or bad document craftsmanship?

Tally counts where possible. Cite specific orgs for notable examples.
Write your findings to "output.md". Keep to 500-1000 words.

# Montefiore Nyack Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Montefiore Nyack Hospital (part of Montefiore Health System) publishes a single "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available in two versions. The current version (form-1.pdf, Rev. 01/2022) is a 3-page fillable PDF linked from the hospital's [Medical Records page](https://www.montefiorenyack.org/manage-my-care/medical-records). An older version (form-2.pdf, Rev. 10/2021) remains accessible at its original URL but is no longer linked from the website. Both forms are facility-branded rather than system-wide Montefiore Health System forms.

The hospital provides three submission channels: fax (845-348-8433), email (ROI@montefiorenyack.org), and phone (845-348-2527), with a physical mailing address also listed. Electronic delivery of records via email is explicitly offered — a notable positive.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Montefiore Nyack does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA release serving patients, attorneys, and "other individuals/companies" as parallel options under a single "RELEASE THE REQUESTED RECORDS TO" section. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or any framing that acknowledges patients have a legal right to their records. The transaction is characterized entirely as an "authorization to release" — a third-party authorization framework applied to patient self-access. A patient can select "PATIENT" as the recipient, but must navigate a form that equally serves attorneys and other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL, and the form is one click from the Medical Records page. The only friction was technical: the site's CDN/WAF blocks automated downloads (curl requests return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. This bot-blocking is likely unintentional but could affect patients using download managers or assistive tools.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a meaningful improvement over its predecessor. It includes 39 interactive fillable fields, allowing patients to complete it digitally rather than printing and handwriting. The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient designation → record type selection → sensitive information consent → legal disclosures → signature → contact information. Section headers are bold and labeled, and record type checkboxes (ER, inpatient, outpatient, images, billing) offer useful granularity.

However, several quality issues undercut the form. All 39 fillable fields lack accessible names, creating a significant screen-reader accessibility gap. The form has inflated to 3 pages and 353 KB (with 210 embedded images) compared to the older single-page version covering identical content in 70 KB. The revocation paragraph contains a grammatical error ("affect" instead of "effect") and switches between first and second person mid-sentence, suggesting poorly merged source text. Despite a header instructing patients to "SPECIFY THE DATES OF SERVICE," no field exists for entering dates. The distinction between an "abstract" and a full medical record is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to request the full record.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no witness signature, no in-person submission requirement. Fees are not mentioned at all — neither disclosed nor waived. Revocation rights and re-disclosure warnings are clearly stated. Sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug, mental health, HIV) are appropriately separated per New York State law. The electronic delivery option requires a somewhat confusing two-step process (provide email on the form and send a confirmation email to ROI@montefiorenyack.org), adding unnecessary friction.

## Overall Assessment

Montefiore Nyack Hospital provides a functional, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process. The fillable PDF, multiple submission channels, and electronic delivery option are genuine strengths that place it above many peers. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — funneling self-access requests through a generic third-party authorization form — is the most significant gap. The form's technical quality is further diminished by unnamed fillable fields, grammatical errors, and confusing instructions around dates of service and electronic delivery. The hospital earns a solid **B grade**: accessible and usable, but not designed around the patient self-access use case.

# Arizona Community Physicians — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Arizona Community Physicians (ACP) is an independent, for-profit physician practice group in Tucson, Arizona. The organization maintains a well-organized patient forms page at azacp.com/forms/ with seven downloadable PDFs covering general records release, practice-specific release, imaging-specific release, adult/minor access designation, a Spanish minor access form, and a HIPAA amendment request. Critically, ACP also offers an online electronic records self-request wizard through Swellbox (swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html), providing a modern digital pathway alongside the paper forms.

## Relevant Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1.pdf** — the general "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (Form 100, revised 08/26/2024). However, ACP also provides the **Swellbox online wizard**, which is the superior pathway for a patient who wants to submit a request electronically without printing, hand-filling, and physically delivering a paper form. The forms page links to both options, giving patients a choice.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

ACP does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release, with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields that frame the transaction as a provider-to-provider or provider-to-entity transfer. The "TO" field is labeled "Name of Physician/Organization," implying the recipient should be another provider rather than the patient. A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name and address in that field, but the form provides no guidance for this use case. The purpose checkboxes include "At request of Patient," which at least acknowledges patient-initiated requests, but the form structure does not differentiate the legal framework (HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524 vs. authorization under § 164.508).

The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, may offer a more patient-centric experience as an electronic self-request tool, though its exact workflow was not evaluated as a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding ACP's forms was **easy**. The Patient Forms page is linked from the main website navigation, and multiple search strategies (web search, site-specific search, direct navigation) all returned direct PDF URLs. No login, bot blocking, or browser fallback was needed. The forms page is clearly organized and lists all seven documents. The Swellbox wizard link is also present on the forms page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF** with a native text layer. Despite being revised in August 2024, it has zero fillable fields — all blanks are underscore placeholders requiring printing and handwriting. The layout is clean and logically organized with capitalized section headers (PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM/TO, PURPOSE, TYPE OF INFORMATION). The language is generally plain and accessible, though the fee disclosure is confusingly placed as a footnote under the "Other" purpose checkbox rather than in its own section. The form collects a reasonable set of fields (~12-15 blanks) without requesting a Social Security Number — a positive privacy practice. It includes a "Former Name" field, which is a thoughtful inclusion.

The form offers three delivery format options (paper, disc/PDF, email), though email is restricted to "medical records processed by CIOX" without explaining what that means. The two-tier record type structure appropriately separates general records from protected records (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse) with distinct consent checkboxes.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness requirements.** Fees are disclosed at $0.07/page and $6.50/disc — both modest and within HIPAA limits — though "additional charges for shipping and handling" are mentioned without quantification. The one-year authorization expiration is standard. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated.

The most significant barrier is the **absence of submission instructions** on form-1 itself — no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal URL. A patient who downloads and prints the form has no idea where to send it. This is a functional defect. By contrast, form-7 (amendment request) includes explicit mail, fax, and in-person delivery instructions. The Swellbox wizard partially mitigates this by offering an entirely separate electronic pathway, but form-1 doesn't reference it.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox electronic self-request wizard** provides a modern digital alternative to the paper form ecosystem
- **Comprehensive form suite** — seven distinct documents covering diverse patient needs, including imaging-specific and amendment request forms
- **Spanish-language minor access form** (form-6) demonstrates language access awareness appropriate for Tucson's ~42% Hispanic population
- **No SSN collection** on the primary ROI form
- **Protected records separation** with distinct checkboxes for HIV, behavioral health, and substance abuse
- **HIPAA amendment request form** published online — uncommon among practices

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient self-access form** — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization
- **No fillable fields on any form** — all seven PDFs are flat, print-and-fill documents
- **No Spanish version of the primary ROI form** (form-1), despite Spanish availability for the minor access form
- **Missing submission instructions** on the primary ROI form
- **Fee disclosure placement** is confusing (buried under "Other" purpose checkbox)
- **1-year default records limitation** may surprise patients seeking complete history

## Overall Assessment

ACP demonstrates above-average organizational effort in making patient forms accessible online, with a well-organized forms page, a comprehensive suite of documents, and — crucially — a Swellbox electronic self-request option that elevates the patient experience beyond the paper-form baseline. However, the primary ROI form itself is a generic third-party authorization that doesn't distinguish patient self-access, lacks fillable fields, and omits submission instructions. The availability of the Swellbox pathway is the key differentiator that lifts ACP's overall assessment, though the paper form ecosystem could benefit from modernization and better patient-access-specific design.

# Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital is a critical access hospital in Miller, SD, part of the Avera Health regional nonprofit system. The facility does not publish its own ROI form; instead, patients use Avera Health's system-wide "Authorization – Release Of Medical Records Information" form (Form 8691-04). Only one form was found applicable to this facility.

## Pathway Assessment: Generic Third-Party Authorization

The sole available form is a **general-purpose HIPAA authorization** designed for disclosure of records between any two parties. It does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third party (attorney, insurer, other provider) requesting records with patient authorization. The form's structure — with separate "Provider (Who is releasing information?)" and "Disclose Information to (Where is information to be sent?)" sections — frames the transaction as a release between entities, not as a patient exercising individual access rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524).

There is no dedicated patient access form, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no simplified workflow for self-access. A patient wanting their own records must complete the same authorization form as a third-party requester, filling in themselves as the recipient. The form does reference 45 CFR 164.524 in its authorization block, acknowledging the right to inspect or obtain copies, but this is buried in legal boilerplate rather than presented as a primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The Hand County facility profile page on avera.org does not link directly to any medical records form. A patient would need to navigate to Avera Health's system-level "Request Medical Records" page or perform a web search. Additionally, Avera's website **blocks automated downloads** (curl/wget return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. The form URL is descriptively named, which is a minor positive.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally generated PDF** with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, making it a print-and-handwrite document. Patients must print, fill by hand, and submit via fax or mail. The layout uses labeled left-margin sections (Patient Identification, Provider, Disclose Information to, etc.) which provide reasonable navigation, but fitting all content onto one page results in a visually dense, cramped document. The language mixes moderately plain English with regulatory references (42 CFR Part 2, 45 CFR 164.524) and HIV/AIDS disclosure warnings — functional but not optimized for patient readability.

The form asks for approximately 15–18 discrete fields including patient demographics, provider information, recipient information, record type checkboxes, date ranges, format preferences, purpose, expiration date, and signature. This is a moderate field count for an authorization form, though several fields (provider address, recipient fax) add complexity that a patient self-access form would not need.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and may deter privacy-conscious patients.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" field is present without clarification of whether it is required or optional. If interpreted as mandatory, this creates an unnecessary barrier.
- **No submission instructions on form**: The form does not print a mailing address or designate the fax number as a submission destination; the Avera fax number (605-322-8200) appears only in the context of "questions about disclosure."
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Charges may apply" for entire record requests with no fee schedule or amounts provided.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: The form offers paper, fax, flash drive, CD-ROM, and email — with encryption by default and an explicit opt-out for unencrypted delivery. This is a notably comprehensive set of format choices.
- **45 CFR 164.524 citation**: Explicit reference to the HIPAA Right of Access provision signals regulatory awareness.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Covering all required elements on one page reduces printing burden.

## Overall Assessment

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital provides a functional but **generic, third-party-oriented** pathway for records access. The form is adequate for its purpose as a system-wide authorization but does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, SSN collection, and ambiguous witness requirement create friction. The strong delivery format options and 45 CFR 164.524 reference are bright spots, but the overall experience reflects an organization that has not optimized for patient-initiated access requests.

# Cherokee Health Systems (River Valley Health) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cherokee Health Systems, now rebranded as **River Valley Health**, is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The organization provides a well-organized suite of four PDF documents for medical records requests, available on a dedicated Medical Records page at rvh.org. The suite consists of the primary English ROI authorization form, a Spanish translation, and color-coded instructional guides in both languages — a standout accessibility feature that few organizations match.

## Forms and Pathways

All four documents are variants of a single general-purpose **"Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Health Records"** form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form distinct from the third-party release authorization. The form is bidirectional — it can be used to request records from an external provider or to authorize River Valley Health to send records elsewhere. A "Personal Use" checkbox is included among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Record Requested to be Sent From" and "Record to be Sent To" facility sections) assumes an inter-facility transfer model. A patient wanting a copy of their own records must awkwardly fit themselves into the "Record to be Sent To" facility section.

Submission is available via **email** (registration@rvh.org) or **in person**. No fax number for submission is listed on the forms or in the notes, though the form collects fax numbers for the sending/receiving facilities. The email pathway means patients can submit without a physical visit, which is a meaningful accessibility advantage.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which is also accessible via the main website navigation (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records). All four PDFs are prominently linked with clear labels and descriptive filenames. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot protection blocking direct programmatic downloads — a hosting infrastructure issue, not an intentional barrier. The page includes contextual submission instructions alongside the download links.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — despite being born-digital and recently updated (December 2025), the form was designed for print-and-handwrite completion. A patient must print, fill by hand, scan or photograph, and email the result. This is a meaningful accessibility gap for a 2025-era document.

The layout is logically organized with clear section headers: patient information, sending facility, receiving facility, record type checkboxes, purpose checkboxes, and a signature block. The upper portion is clean and self-explanatory. The lower portion contains two dense legal paragraphs — a sensitive information disclosure notice (appropriately citing 42 C.F.R. Part 2 and HIPAA) and a certification block that packs six signer categories into a single run-on sentence. The certification text is challenging for a typical patient to parse.

The **color-coded instructional guides** (forms 3 and 4) are a genuine bright spot. They overlay plain-language annotations explaining each section ("Enter your personal information in this section," "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider"), effectively translating bureaucratic form headers into understandable instructions. This paired approach — plain form plus annotated guide — is uncommon and genuinely helpful.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no fee disclosure (meaning no upfront fee barrier, though patients are also not informed of costs). The authorization expires after 12 months, and revocation rights are clearly stated.

The form does **not** reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), does not include a patient rights statement, and does not state a response timeframe. These are missed opportunities but not violations.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: The bilingual form suite with instructional companions is exceptional. Providing annotated guides in both English and Spanish demonstrates genuine commitment to patient comprehension and language accessibility — this goes well beyond the typical approach of offering a bare authorization form. The forms are recently updated (December 2025), indicating active maintenance. Email submission availability removes the in-person barrier.

**Weaknesses**: The absence of fillable fields in a born-digital 2025 PDF is a notable gap. The form's generic ROI authorization design does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a bidirectional facility-routing model when they simply want their own records. The Spanish version contains minor translation errors (CRF vs. CFR, missing closing parenthesis).

## Overall Assessment

Cherokee Health Systems earns a **B grade** overall. The organization clearly invested in patient communication — the bilingual instructional guides are a model other organizations should emulate. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the form wasn't designed with that use case front-of-mind.

# Broward Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Broward Health, a government-owned regional health system in Fort Lauderdale, FL, offers a single general-purpose ROI authorization form ("Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Information") in four languages: English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese. The organization also provides an online records request wizard via Swellbox, a third-party vendor. The system operates multiple facilities (Medical Center, North, Coral Springs, Imperial Point, East Imaging Center, Weston), all sharing the same form and process.

## Access Pathway

Broward Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ROI form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both purposes, with a "MYSELF" checkbox alongside an "OTHER" option for third-party recipients. While this checkbox makes it possible for patients to request their own records, the form was not designed around the patient access use case — it requires a purpose statement (not required under HIPAA § 164.524 for patient access), applies minimum necessary language to all requests (which should not apply to individual access under 45 CFR § 164.502(b)(2)(v)), and includes a witness signature line that creates unnecessary procedural friction.

The Swellbox online wizard at `swellbox.com/broward-health-wizard.html` offers a potentially better digital pathway, though the PDF form appears to be the primary resource offered on the Medical Records Request page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The Medical Records Request page is reachable in approximately 3 clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Information Request → Medical Records Request) and is well-organized, listing all four language versions with direct download links plus the Swellbox option. However, **Cloudflare bot protection** blocked all direct `curl` download attempts, requiring browser-based retrieval. The English form URL was also case-sensitive, with the lowercase variant linked on the page failing — a subtle but real broken link.

## Form Document Quality

The form quality is a mixed picture. On the positive side, the form is a concise single page with a logical section flow: sensitive record classification, patient demographics, authorization and recipient designation, delivery method, purpose, date range, detailed record type checklist (~15 categories with date ranges for lab and radiology), patient rights disclosures, and signatures.

On the negative side, the **English version (form-1.pdf) is an image-only scan** — a grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no screen reader accessibility. This is the primary language version yet the worst quality artifact. The Spanish, Creole, and Portuguese versions are digitally created PDFs with text layers, but they too have **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The Spanish and Portuguese versions also have garbled text from font encoding errors in their expiration clauses. The form's footer references "ADDRESSOGRAPH" and carbon-copy routing ("WHITE - MEDICAL RECORD / CANARY - PATIENTS"), confirming its origin as a physical paper form from 2014 that has never been modernized.

Delivery options are limited to paper or **encrypted CD** — an anachronistic option in 2026 with no email, portal, or electronic transfer available through the form itself.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form includes a **witness signature line**, which is not required by HIPAA for patient access requests and could prevent patients from completing the form at home. A Broward Health authorized signature line is also present, suggesting the form may have been designed for in-person processing. No notarization is required. Fees are referenced vaguely ("reasonable charge" per CFR 164.524) without specific amounts. The website notes approximately 3 business days for processing. Fax submission is available at facility-specific numbers, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Exceptional multilingual support**: Offering the ROI form in four languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese) reflects genuine attention to South Florida's linguistic diversity and is rare among U.S. healthcare organizations.
- **Swellbox online portal**: Provides a fully digital alternative pathway for patients who cannot or prefer not to use the PDF.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 citation**: References the HIPAA Right of Access regulation directly in patient rights disclosures.
- **Granular record type selection**: The detailed checklist with date-range filtering gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.

## Overall Assessment

Broward Health demonstrates genuine effort in accessibility through multilingual forms and an online portal alternative, but the underlying form infrastructure is outdated and not patient-access-oriented. The 2014-era generic ROI authorization, image-only English scan, lack of fillable fields, witness requirement, and inappropriate application of minimum necessary language to patient requests all reflect an organization that has not modernized its records request process to match the spirit of HIPAA's individual access rights. The Swellbox portal partially redeems the experience, but the PDF pathway — which remains prominently offered — falls short of modern standards. **Grade: C.**

# Grady Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's major public safety-net hospital operating under Grady Health System, provides patients with a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Three PDF documents were found: a current authorization form (form-1, revised 2/22), an older superseded version (form-2, revised 5/15), and a combined instructions-plus-form package (form-3, bundling the older form with a COVID-era cover page). None of these forms are tailored specifically for patient self-access — all are structured as "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information," framing the process as a release between two parties rather than an individual exercising their right of access.

## Access Pathway

Grady does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting someone else's records. All requesters use the same authorization form with identical "Request Information From" / "Release Information To" fields. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively addressing the form to themselves. The form does include "Personal" as a purpose option, and the documentation requirements section on page 2 distinguishes "Patients Requesting Their Own Medical Records" from third-party requests — but this distinction lives in the supporting text, not in the form design itself. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the main authorization form and the medical records page at gradyhealth.org/medical-records/. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without login, bot blocking, or broken links. The medical records page provides clear context for the forms. This earns high marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the current primary form, is a 2-page digitally-created PDF with a text layer and clean layout. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. For a digitally-created document with 12 embedded fonts, this is a missed opportunity. The form is logically organized (demographics → from/to parties → date range → record types → purpose → format/method → legal notices → signature) with clear section delineation. The record type selection offers approximately 25 checkboxes across three categories (Hospital Visits, Office Visits, Diagnostic Imaging), giving patients granular control.

The language is mostly accessible, with the opening instruction plainly stating what the form does. However, the legal sections contain dense language including a broad liability waiver: "I will not hold Grady... responsible for anything that may happen from the use or release of my PHI." The completeness warning — "If any selection is incomplete, this form may be considered invalid" — could discourage submission if patients are uncertain about any field.

## Submission & Delivery

Critically, **submission options are limited to in-person drop-off and postal mail only**. The form-3 cover page explicitly lists only these two options for submitting the completed form. No fax number is provided for form submission, no email submission is available, and no online portal exists. This means a patient cannot complete the entire process without either physically visiting the hospital or waiting for postal mail.

For *receiving* records, options are better: the current form-1 offers encrypted email delivery, paper, CD, mail, pick-up, and fax (continuing care only). Form-3's cover page also references electronic delivery through CIOX Health (now Datavant), with 2-business-day processing for electronic and 7–10 days for mail.

## Barriers & Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The broad liability waiver bundled into the authorization is the most significant concern — patients should not be asked to waive accountability as a condition of records access. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which exceeds what's needed when photo ID is also required. Mandatory government-issued photo ID may burden patients of a safety-net hospital who lack such documentation.

**Bright spots**: The encrypted email delivery option on form-1 is genuinely uncommon and valuable. The form-3 cover page provides excellent operational guidance — processing timelines, fee disclosure ($6.50 max), and the note that continuing care requests are free. Multiple delivery format options (paper, CD, email) give patients real choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

Grady Memorial Hospital makes its forms easy to find and offers some progressive delivery options, but falls short on two critical dimensions: the forms are entirely paper-based (non-fillable, print-and-handwrite only) and submission requires physical delivery. The generic authorization form does not center patient self-access, and the liability waiver raises compliance concerns. For a major public hospital, the absence of any digital submission pathway and the reliance on a third-party release form for patient access represent meaningful barriers. **Grade: C.**

# Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital (Richmond, VA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital is part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system and uses system-wide forms for its Richmond-area facilities. Two PDF forms were found: an English-language "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" (form-1.pdf, BSR-MR-50, rev. 1/21) and a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2.pdf, BSR-MR-50SPN, rev. 11/17). Both are single-page, non-fillable PDFs linked directly from the system's medical records page. Beyond the PDF forms, Bon Secours also offers an online request pathway via Ciox/Swellbox and MyChart patient portal access, giving patients three distinct channels to request records.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

The PDF form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for third-party disclosure — the structure asks the patient to authorize a facility "TO DISCLOSE" information to a named recipient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly name themselves as both authorizer and recipient, navigating a form whose conceptual framework doesn't match their use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form.

That said, the form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an "eDelivery by Ciox (for patient's only)" delivery option specifically marked as patient-exclusive. These suggest some awareness of the patient self-access use case, but the form itself was not redesigned around it. The availability of Ciox/Swellbox as an online portal likely represents a more patient-centered pathway, though it was not evaluated in detail as it is a web-based tool rather than a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately surfaced the Bon Secours medical records page at `bonsecours.com/patient-resources/request-medical-records`, where both PDF forms are directly linked alongside information about online and MyChart options. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The URL path (`roi-form-2017.ashx`) is somewhat opaque but the page itself is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (form-1.pdf) is a digitally-authored, single-page PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. The layout is compact and logically ordered: demographics → record types → recipient → delivery format → purpose → legal terms → signature. The top half uses clear, short labels; the bottom half shifts to dense legal language across four numbered paragraphs. Twelve record-type checkboxes plus two "Other" fields provide good scope granularity. Five delivery format options (US Mail, CD/DVD, Radiology Film/CD, MyChart, Ciox eDelivery) are notably generous.

The Spanish version mirrors the English form but lags by over three years (November 2017 vs. January 2021), contains several untranslated English field labels ("Anesthesia Record," "Radiology Film/CD"), and has a minor typographical error (double closing parenthesis). While the existence of a Spanish form is commendable, the version discrepancy raises concerns about whether Spanish-speaking patients receive equivalent information.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees are vaguely stated**: "copying charges will be applied, according to the hospital policy" — with no specific amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) and third-party release fees. This is a compliance concern.
- **No response time stated** on the form.
- **Fax submission is available** (fax number listed in notes: 804-673-9561), so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multilingual availability**: English and Spanish forms linked from the same page — better than most organizations.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Five options including MyChart and Ciox eDelivery with email, going well beyond the typical mail-or-fax binary.
- **Multiple request channels**: PDF form, Ciox/Swellbox online portal, and MyChart portal give patients real choice.
- **Single-page efficiency**: All necessary content on one page reduces patient burden.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference**: The form cites the HIPAA Right of Access provision, which is uncommon and helpful.

## Weaknesses

- **Generic disclosure form, not patient-access form**: The form is conceptually designed for third-party release, forcing patients to adapt.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form lacks any interactive fields — a missed opportunity.
- **Vague fee language**: No fee schedule, no patient-access fee distinction.
- **Spanish version outdated**: Three-year lag behind English version with untranslated fields.

## Overall Assessment

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The form is easy to find, compact, and offers unusually good delivery options including electronic delivery for patients. The multilingual availability and multiple request channels (PDF, Swellbox, MyChart) are genuine strengths. However, the core PDF form remains a generic third-party authorization that doesn't center the patient self-access use case, it lacks fillable fields, and its fee language falls short of HIPAA transparency standards. The overall experience is adequate but not exemplary — a patient can get their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary user.

# Brattleboro Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, an independent nonprofit community hospital in Brattleboro, Vermont, publishes three ROI-related forms on its website. All three are general-purpose HIPAA disclosure authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to or from third parties. None is a dedicated patient access request form. The most current version — form-1.pdf, dated January 2025 — serves as the primary pathway for any patient requesting their own records, though patients must navigate a third-party-oriented workflow to do so.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three forms use a FROM/TO structure designed for transfers between parties. A patient requesting their own records would need to select the "Personal Records" purpose checkbox (available only on form-1 and form-3, not form-2) and enter their own name in the "TO" field — a workable but unintuitive approach. There is no online portal, patient portal integration, or web-based request wizard. The hospital's HIM Department lists a phone number (802-257-8258) and fax number (802-257-8881) on the form header, providing fax as an electronic submission channel, though the form itself never explicitly states how to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Standard web searches immediately returned direct PDF links hosted on the hospital's WordPress site. No login, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. However, the three overlapping forms are published without any landing page, version guidance, or indication of which is current. A patient who finds form-2 (older, shorter, with a witness line and 6-month default expiration) gets a materially different experience than one who finds form-1 (updated, more comprehensive, 12-month expiration, no witness line).

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1.pdf** (the best available) is a 2-page flat PDF. Despite retrieval notes suggesting fillable fields, metadata confirms zero interactive form fields — all blanks are underscore lines and text-rendered checkbox characters. Patients must print, handwrite, and submit via fax or physical delivery. The two-page structure is logical (instructions/rights on page 1, data entry on page 2), and required fields are marked with an asterisk convention. However, page 2 is densely packed with FROM/TO fields, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, verbal communication designees, date ranges, and signature blocks. Some checkbox labels are misaligned across columns. The language mixes plain statements with ALL CAPS instructions and bureaucratic phrasing — Instruction 4, which conditions processing on internal record completeness, is particularly confusing for patients.

The form offers approximately 15 fields for patient completion, a reasonable scope. Record-type checkboxes are comprehensive, covering standard categories plus sensitive information (psychiatric, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, hepatitis) and notably progressive categories (reproductive health care, gender affirming care). Delivery options are limited to "Pick Up" and "Send Out" with no electronic delivery mentioned.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on form-1 (though form-2 includes a witness line that may create perceived barriers). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "in accordance with state and federal law" — without specific amounts or a fee schedule. No response time commitment is stated. The form does not require in-person submission, and fax is available as an electronic submission pathway.

## Notable Strengths

- **Progressive sensitive-information categories**: The January 2025 revision includes Reproductive Health Care and Gender Affirming Care checkboxes — unusually inclusive for a community hospital.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to receive health services" directly addresses a common patient concern.
- **Verbal communication designees**: A dedicated section for authorizing up to three individuals for verbal communication with the hospital goes beyond typical ROI forms.
- **Easy online availability**: Forms are publicly accessible without any barriers to download.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: All forms funnel patients through a generic third-party disclosure workflow.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: The primary form cannot be completed digitally despite its digitally-authored appearance.
- **Multiple unversioned forms**: Three overlapping documents with no guidance creates confusion.
- **No electronic delivery options**: Only physical pickup or mail for receiving records.
- **No explicit submission instructions**: Fax and phone numbers are listed but the form never tells patients how to submit it.

## Overall Assessment

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The forms are easy to find and free of egregious barriers, and the January 2025 update shows thoughtfulness around sensitive health categories. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, non-fillable form format, and absence of electronic delivery options place the hospital behind peers who have modernized their records request processes. The overall experience earns a **C grade** — functional but not patient-centered.

# NorthLakes Community Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NorthLakes Community Clinic is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Ashland, Wisconsin. The organization publishes two Release of Information forms on its website, both generic HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 authorization forms that serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party transfers, legal, disability, and more. There is no dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization.

## Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms are publicly available from the medical records page (https://nlccwi.org/for-our-patients/medical-records/):

- **form-1.pdf** ("Release of Information," 12/2023): The newer, current form. One page, numbered sections (1–6), with clear "Release FROM" / "Release TO" fields, granular record-type checkboxes, and explicit fax submission instructions (715-318-5644). However, it has **zero fillable fields** — a patient must print and hand-fill it. It does offer an encrypted email delivery option for receiving records.

- **form-2.pdf** ("Health Information Release," 4/2022): The older form with **54 fillable PDF fields**, intentionally designed for digital completion (the filename includes "Fillable"). But it lacks any submission instructions — no fax number, no mailing address, no email. A patient who fills it out digitally has no idea where to send it.

Both share the same internal registration number (REG-002), suggesting form-1 was meant to supersede form-2, yet both remain available with no guidance on which to use. The organization appears to have regressed in digital accessibility: the newer form removed fillable fields while adding better submission instructions and an encrypted email delivery option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NorthLakes does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Release FROM" / "Release TO" structure designed for inter-organizational transfers. A patient requesting their own records must place NorthLakes in the "FROM" field and themselves in the "TO" field — workable but not intuitive. Positively, both forms include a "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox, explicitly acknowledging patient-directed requests as a valid use case. Neither form references HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) by name.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A simple web search immediately returned both PDF URLs. The organization's website hosts them as direct links under a clearly labeled medical records section. No bot blocking, login, or JavaScript rendering was required. Retrieval difficulty: **Easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Assessed using the high-watermark principle across both forms:

- **Fillability**: The older form-2 is genuinely fillable with 54 interactive fields. The current form-1 is not. A patient aware of both could use form-2 for digital completion, but the org steers toward form-1.
- **Layout**: Both forms use numbered sections with reasonable logical flow (patient info → directionality → purpose → record types → consent/signature). However, both cram everything onto a single dense page. Form-2's purpose and record-type sections are visually interleaved in a confusing two-column layout.
- **Language**: Consent paragraphs lean toward dense legalese, particularly on form-2 where a long unbroken paragraph covers treatment conditioning, re-disclosure, 42 CFR Part 2, Wisconsin DHS regulations, and revocation rights with no visual breaks. Form-1 improves on this with bulleted "I understand that..." statements.
- **Record selection**: Unusually granular. Both forms separate Mental Health, Substance Use Treatment, and Psychiatry records into distinct categories with individual checkboxes — giving patients fine-grained control over sensitive disclosures.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness required. No in-person submission requirement. Fax submission is explicitly available (form-1). No fees are mentioned — neither disclosed as free nor quantified. No response time is stated, though form-1 provides an urgent fax line for requests "requiring a response within a week." The confusing citation of "Federal Privacy Law (42 CFR Part 2) (HIPAA)" incorrectly implies 42 CFR Part 2 is part of HIPAA, which could mislead patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Encrypted email delivery option for records (form-1)
- "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox on both forms
- Granular behavioral health record type selection
- Verbal revocation explicitly acknowledged (form-2)
- Clear treatment non-conditioning language
- Fillable PDF exists (form-2), showing digital investment capability

## Overall Assessment

NorthLakes Community Clinic provides a functional but unrefined patient access experience. The forms are easy to find, free of major barriers, and offer good record-type granularity. However, the organization funnels all patients through a generic ROI authorization designed for third-party transfers, with no dedicated patient access pathway. The regression from a fillable to a non-fillable primary form is a notable step backward. A patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience. **Grade: C (3.35/5.0).**

# Shannon Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Shannon Health, a nonprofit regional health system in San Angelo, TX, provides a single Authorization for Release of Information (ROI) form for all records requests. The form is available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful accommodation for the area's large Hispanic population. While the form is easy to find and includes several patient-friendly features, it follows the common pattern of routing patient self-access requests through a generic third-party release authorization rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Forms & Pathways

Shannon Health offers two downloaded documents, but they are functionally one form in two languages:

- **form-1.pdf** (English): "Authorization for Release of Information," revised 06/2024
- **form-2.pdf** (Spanish): "Autorización para la Divulgación de Información," identical structure

The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-1.pdf (English). The form includes a "Self" checkbox under the recipient field and "Personal Use" among purpose options, acknowledging patient access as a use case. However, the form's structure — with fields for recipient organization, address, phone, fax, and relationship — assumes a third-party release scenario. A patient requesting their own records must navigate these irrelevant fields, with no guidance on how to handle them when "Self" is selected.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal for record requests, and no separate streamlined process for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The website's navigation path — **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** — leads directly to a page with clearly labeled download links for both language versions. This is a 2-click path from the homepage. One minor friction point: web search results initially returned outdated URLs (`medical-record-authorization.pdf`) that produced 404 errors. The filenames were updated for 2025 without redirects, creating link rot. Navigating the website directly resolved this.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores for handwriting; no checkboxes are interactive. For a form dated 2025, this is a significant missed opportunity. Patients must print the PDF, hand-fill all fields, then scan or photograph it for electronic submission.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → substance use disorder options → format → legal terms → signature → return instructions. The flow is intuitive, and the form uses reasonably clear language, though page 2's legal disclosures are denser. The form provides granular control over record scope with approximately 15 record type checkboxes, a date range field, and hospital/clinic selection. The three-option handling of substance use disorder records (include all, exclude all, select specific) is well-designed.

Approximately 25 fields require completion, which is proportionate for a general-purpose ROI form but more than a dedicated patient access form would need.

## Barriers

**Fees**: The form states fees "may" be charged and requires the patient to "agree to pay accordingly" — without disclosing amounts or referencing applicable fee limits. This vague blanket acceptance is the most significant concern; a patient has no idea what they're agreeing to.

**No notarization or witness** required. **No in-person submission** required — email is explicitly listed as the "Preferred Method" via `ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org`. Mail and in-person delivery are also available. No fax submission is listed, but email more than compensates.

**Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) linked side-by-side on the records page — appropriate for San Angelo's demographics (~45% Hispanic)
- **Email as the preferred submission method** — unusually patient-friendly; most orgs default to fax or mail
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: MyChart portal access and encrypted email via ShareFile, in addition to paper, CD, pick-up, and mail
- **Non-conditioning disclosure**: Explicitly states Shannon cannot condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on signing the authorization — an important HIPAA protection many forms omit
- **Substance use disorder records handling**: Three clear options giving patients granular control over sensitive information

## Overall Assessment

Shannon Health delivers an above-average but not exceptional patient experience. The form is easy to find, reasonably well-designed, and submitted through a patient-friendly email channel. The bilingual offering and electronic delivery options are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (funneling patients through a generic third-party authorization), the absence of fillable fields in a 2025-edition form, and the vague fee disclosure prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process wasn't designed with that use case as the primary concern.

# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Anchorage, Alaska. Two documents were retrieved from its publicly accessible forms page: a primary ROI authorization form ("Advanced Authorization for Release of Information," Rev. 08/2025) and a standing PHI Disclosure Agreement (Rev. 8/4/23). Of these, form-1 is the relevant document for a patient requesting copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

ANHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary ROI form (form-1) is a dual-purpose generic HIPAA authorization covering both "obtain information from" an external source and "release information to" a third party. A patient wanting their own records must check "Release Information to" and fill in their own name and address as the recipient — functional, but not intuitive. The form's instructions frame it around sending records elsewhere, not around the patient's individual Right of Access. There is no separate, simplified pathway for patients who just want their own records.

That said, the form does include a notably strong patient-rights statement: it explicitly cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and tells patients they are "NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information." This is uncommon and commendable, partially compensating for the generic form structure.

The retrieval notes also mention a text-based ROI request option (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which could be a more accessible alternative channel, though its scope and workflow aren't detailed on the forms page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped search surfaced the ANHC forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms), which is well-organized with clear section headings including a "Request a Release of Information" section with direct PDF links. No bot blocking, captchas, or authentication barriers were encountered. The form was also available in Spanish, which is a notable accessibility feature for an FQHC. Difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally composed document — not a scan — with a clean text layer and reasonable file size (164 KB). However, despite being revised as recently as August 2025, it has **zero fillable PDF fields**. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and return it via fax or in person. This is a significant missed opportunity for a document that is clearly digitally designed.

The form collects approximately 15 fields: patient name, DOB, last four SSN digits, two phone numbers, full address, recipient information, record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization, date range, and signature. Requesting SSN digits is unnecessary for a records request and adds friction. The form fits everything on one page, which is efficient but dense. Layout is adequate with clear section divisions, though the volume of content compressed onto a single page limits whitespace.

Language is generally accessible. The introductory "PLEASE READ" paragraph is clear and plain-language. The legal disclosure section is denser but not impenetrable, covering authorization voluntariness, expiration, revocation rights, and redisclosure prohibitions. There is a typo ("heath care" instead of "health care") and a malformed HIPAA citation in the legal text.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Fees**: The form discloses that ANHC charges for copies, with an exception for facility-to-facility transfers. It does not clarify that patient self-access requests are subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee limits, which could discourage patients.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting the last four SSN digits is unnecessary and creates friction.
- **No notarization** required — positive.
- **Submission**: Fax (907-743-7255) is available as an electronic submission method. The form also lists the physical address. No email or portal submission option exists for the ROI form itself, though ANHC does use MyChart (referenced in form-2).
- **Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit HIPAA Right of Access citation** (45 CFR § 164.524) with clear patient-empowering language
- **Spanish-language version** of the ROI form available
- **Text-message alternative** for initiating ROI requests
- **Recently revised** (08/2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Adolescent privacy protections** on form-2 (MyChart proxy access controls for minors 12–17)

## Overall Assessment

ANHC presents a mixed picture. The forms are easy to find, the website is well-organized, and several bright spots — Spanish availability, text-message option, explicit HIPAA rights language — show genuine attention to patient access. However, the core pathway funnels patients through a generic third-party authorization form rather than offering a dedicated patient self-access route, the primary PDF has no fillable fields despite recent revision, and the fee language could discourage patients from exercising their rights. For an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations, the lack of a fillable digital form is a notable gap. The organization earns credit for accessibility features and rights transparency, but falls short on digital form quality and access pathway differentiation.

# Synthesis: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center

## Forms and Pathways

OSU Wexner Medical Center publishes two PDF forms on its [Medical Records page](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records), both titled "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (form ID MC040184, revised 11/2019). Form-1 is a single-page image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields — essentially a digitized paper artifact. Form-2 is a two-page digitally authored PDF that bundles numbered instructions (page 1) with the same authorization form (page 2). Form-2 has a full text layer and 25 embedded fonts but, despite being created in Adobe Acrobat Pro, still has zero fillable fields. Both forms use the same layout and legal text. Form-2 is clearly the better document and serves as the basis for this assessment.

The organization does not appear to offer a patient portal-based records request, an online submission wizard (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), or any other digital request pathway. Submission instructions list three physical mailing addresses and phone numbers for the Medical Information Management offices. No fax number or email address is listed for submitting the completed form. The form does accept eSignatures ("e.g., Adobe") with a date and time stamp, which opens the possibility that a patient could fill the form digitally using annotation tools and email or fax it — but no such submission channel is explicitly provided on the form itself.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

OSU Wexner does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same "Authorization to Release Medical Information" form is used whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney, insurer, or other third party is requesting them. The form's "Release Information To" section uses a sender-recipient model without any acknowledgment that a patient requesting their own records has distinct rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). There is no mention of the Right of Access anywhere on either form. Patients must complete the same "Purpose of Disclosure" field (with no guidance that they are not legally required to state a purpose for their own records), select facilities, and navigate the same legal text as any third-party requester.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned direct download links on the first attempt, and the forms are clearly linked from the organization's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor friction is the presence of two versions of the same form without guidance on which to use — a patient might download the image-only scan (form-1) and have a worse experience.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2's instructions page is a genuine bright spot: seven numbered items correspond to form sections, with practical guidance like "If uncertain about the location, select all box locations." The form itself offers granular record-type checkboxes (11 categories including Emergency Dept, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, Radiology, Pathology, etc.), multi-facility selection across 8 OSU locations, and reasonable purpose-of-disclosure options. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the form page is quite dense — it packs all fields, checkboxes, four paragraphs of legal text, signature lines, and three submission address blocks onto a single page, resulting in small font sizes and cramped spacing. The language mixes accessible instructions with HIPAA-derived terms ("designated record set," "re-disclosed by the recipient") that may confuse patients. Critically, despite being authored in Acrobat Pro, the form has no fillable fields — patients must print and handwrite.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is fee opacity. The form states "a fee may be charged" and directs all billing questions to CIOX Health (1-800-367-1500), a third-party ROI vendor, without any fee schedule or distinction between patient-access and third-party fees. For patient self-access, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts; the lack of transparency here raises concerns. The instructions require "all sections must be completed in their entirety," which means patients must state a purpose — not required by HIPAA for individual access. No notarization is required, and the witness signature is optional, which is positive. The form has not been updated since November 2019, predating the 2021 information blocking rules and 2024 42 CFR Part 2 revisions.

## Bright Spots

- Dedicated, well-structured instructions page with numbered items
- Granular record-type selection (11 categories)
- Multi-facility selection with practical guidance for uncertain patients
- eSignature acceptance (Adobe)
- Correct substance use disorder and psychotherapy notes disclosures

## Overall Assessment

OSU Wexner Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably organized ROI form with useful instructions, but falls short on digital accessibility (no fillable fields, no electronic submission channel), patient-centeredness (no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release), and fee transparency. The process is fundamentally a print-and-mail paper workflow dressed in a PDF wrapper.

# Wayne County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Monticello, Kentucky. The facility provides a single one-page form for patients requesting their own medical records, along with a parallel web-based HTML form that captures equivalent information online. For a small rural hospital, the availability of dual pathways — PDF and online — is notably progressive.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Only one downloadable PDF was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." This is a patient-access-oriented form, not a generic third-party authorization. The title and structure center on patient self-access, with "self" listed first among record-ownership options (self, child, other). The hospital also offers a web-based HTML form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` that collects equivalent information and allows electronic submission — a genuinely useful alternative to the print-and-deliver workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Wayne County Hospital does a better-than-average job distinguishing patient self-access from third-party release. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" rather than "Authorization for Release of Information," and the patient is addressed directly as the expected user. However, the same single form is used for all requesters — self, child, or other — with no separate instructions or additional authorization requirements for third-party requests. There is no dedicated third-party release form, which means the form functions as a blended instrument, though its default orientation is clearly toward patient access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted web search. The form lives at `/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf` — a media library path that is not linked from any navigable page on the hospital website. The HIM department page provides a phone number but no form download link. There is no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. A patient browsing the website would likely not discover the PDF without calling HIM or using a search engine. The web-based form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` may be more discoverable through site navigation, though this was not confirmed. Retrieval difficulty is moderate — not hard, but requiring search engine assistance rather than intuitive site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable single page. It has a text layer (not a scan) and uses only three fonts, but all fields are represented as underscore blanks — a print-and-handwrite design. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → request type and delivery method → record ownership → dates of service → specific records requested (10 checkboxes) → reason for request → identification presented → signatures. The language is plain and accessible with no legalese. One page is an appropriate length for this type of request.

Delivery options are strong: fax, email, mail, and pick-up. Email as a delivery option is uncommon at critical access hospitals and reduces barriers for rural patients who may live far from the facility.

## Barriers & Compliance Concerns

**Witness requirement:** The form includes a separate "Witness" signature line. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access requests, and this creates a meaningful barrier — a patient filling out the form at home must find a witness before submitting. This is particularly burdensome for rural and isolated patients.

**Reason for request:** The form asks patients to check a reason (Continuity of Care, Personal Interest, Insurance Claims Processing, Legal Claims Processing, Other) without indicating this is optional. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not justify their request.

**Submission method not specified on PDF:** The form itself does not state where or how to return it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is printed on the document. However, the existence of the web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` provides a clear electronic submission pathway.

**Fee transparency:** The form prominently states "Based on KRS 422.317 a first copy of a patient's record will be provided free, subsequent copies may be charged." This Kentucky-law-based disclosure of free first copies is unusually transparent for a facility of this size.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dual pathway (PDF + web form):** Offering both a downloadable PDF and an online web form is exceptional for a 25-bed critical access hospital.
- **Free-copy disclosure on the form itself:** Citing KRS 422.317 about free first copies directly on the form is a bright spot few larger organizations match.
- **Email delivery option:** Including email alongside fax, mail, and pick-up is forward-thinking.
- **One-page brevity:** No unnecessary legal boilerplate — approachable and quick to complete.

## Overall Assessment

Wayne County Hospital demonstrates a patient-centered approach that exceeds expectations for its size and setting. The form is clearly designed for patient self-access, the language is plain, and the availability of an online web form and email delivery are genuine differentiators. The main weaknesses are the witness signature requirement (a real barrier with no legal basis for patient access requests), the unfindability of the PDF on the website, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF. Despite these issues, the overall pathway is solid — a patient can submit their request electronically via the web form, receive records by email, and pay nothing for a first copy.

# Good Samaritan Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Good Samaritan Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in West Palm Beach, FL, operated under the Palm Beach Health Network (PBHN), itself part of Tenet Healthcare. The facility offers two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records release — an older facility-specific version (form-1, dated 2014) and a newer network-wide version (form-2, dated 2020). Records requests are processed through Datavant, a third-party ROI vendor, with email submission available. The parent system's medical records page also offers the form in Spanish and Haitian Creole.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

Good Samaritan does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — standard third-party disclosure authorization forms. A patient requesting their own records must name themselves as the "RECIPIENT" (the field asks for "person(s) to whom [the facility] may disclose my health information") and check "Personal Use" under the PURPOSE section. This is functional but unintuitive; the form was clearly designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties, not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. Neither form references the right of access, offers format options for records delivery, or distinguishes self-access from third-party release in any meaningful way.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately surfaced a direct link to form-1 on the hospital's website, and the parent PBHN medical records page linked to form-2 along with Spanish and Haitian Creole versions. However, Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic download, requiring browser-based workarounds. For a typical patient using a browser, this would not be an issue. One source of confusion: both the older facility form and the newer network form are published simultaneously with no guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2, the 2020 network version) is a 2-page print-and-fill PDF with **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring handwriting. The form follows a logical structure — facility selection, demographics, record type checkboxes (20 categories), recipient, term, purpose, super-confidential categories — but is visually dense with small fonts. Notably, form-2 exposes raw mail-merge placeholders in the sidebar (`«PatientNumber»`, `«PatientName»`, `«BirthDate»`, etc.) that are meaningless to patients and appear unprofessional. The form also references a Privacy Office address "listed below" that does not actually appear anywhere on the document — a broken internal reference that prevents patients from exercising their right to revoke authorization.

The language is moderately legalistic. The legal paragraphs on redisclosure, revocation, and treatment conditioning are standard healthcare boilerplate but lack plain-language explanation. The form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for HIPAA identity verification and creates data security risk on a form transmitted via fax or mail.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit via fax (561-650-6467, listed on form-1), email to Datavant (SM-Tenetgoodsamaritan@Datavant.com, per retrieval notes), mail, or in-person pickup. The availability of fax and email means patients are not forced to physically visit the facility, which meets the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers:** SSN collection is unnecessary and potentially deterrent. No fees are disclosed — patients have no visibility into costs before submitting. The form's lack of fillable fields means the entire completion process is paper-based. Form-2 is missing Privacy Office contact information, and its omission of the remuneration disclosure present in form-1 raises compliance questions given Datavant's involvement.

**Bright spots:** Multilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is a genuine strength for the Palm Beach community. The 20+ record-type checkboxes give patients granular control over what is disclosed. Flexible authorization term options (specific date, until fulfilled, until event, until withdrawn) are well-designed. The super-confidential information section on page 2 properly handles Florida state law and 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for sensitive health information categories.

## Overall Assessment

Good Samaritan Medical Center provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all requestors — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access. The forms lack digital fillability, contain confusing internal system artifacts, and collect unnecessary personal information. While multilingual availability and granular record selection are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects a process designed around institutional workflow rather than patient needs. Grade: **C**.

# Western Washington Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Everett, WA. Three ROI-related documents were retrieved: a primary organization-wide fillable authorization form (form-1), a GI department-specific non-fillable release form (form-2), and a generic unbranded authorization hosted on PatientPop (form-3). Form-1 is clearly the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records and is the basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WWMG does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Western Washington Medical Group to RELEASE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION" — a standard third-party release authorization. Patients requesting their own records use the same form as those authorizing release to an attorney, insurer, or another provider. "Personal (to patient)" appears as one of several purpose checkboxes, annotated with "*service fee may apply." There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal option for record requests. The form does not reference the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish individual access rights from third-party authorization. A patient must navigate a form designed around sending records to someone else and adapt it for self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search returned direct PDF links, and WWMG maintains a dedicated Medical Records Request page (wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/) that links to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or portal requirements were encountered. The URL is descriptive and the form is also listed on the Patient Intake and Registration Forms page. The only complication is the existence of three forms — a patient could potentially encounter the inferior GI-specific (form-2) or orphaned PatientPop form (form-3) instead of the primary one, though the website clearly surfaces form-1.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a single-page fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — well above average for healthcare ROI forms. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → record scope → sensitive information exclusions → purpose → expiration → signature. The language is relatively plain, with direct instructions like "PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE." The scope options are strong, offering four ways to define what records are released (all within 3 years, specific condition, specific dates, or mutual exchange). The sensitive information exclusion section gives patients granular control over HIV, STD, psychiatric, and substance abuse records using an opt-out model with required initials.

The form is not a scan — it was designed digitally with clean text, multiple fonts, and embedded branding. At 143 KB for a single page, it is appropriately sized. WWMG's address is pre-filled, reducing patient burden.

## Submission and Delivery

The form directs patients to "visit wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request and refer to the contact info on the chart" for submission instructions, rather than listing submission options directly on the form. The "OFFICE USE ONLY" section indicates records can be faxed, mailed, or emailed — confirming electronic submission pathways exist. This indirect approach adds a step but avoids restricting patients to in-person delivery. Fax availability means patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or witness signature is required. However, two issues stand out:

1. **Vague fee language**: The "*service fee may apply" note next to "Personal (to patient)" is concerning. HIPAA limits fees for patient access to reasonable, cost-based amounts, and this language provides no specifics, potentially discouraging patients or leading to overcharging.

2. **Misleading "ALL" scope**: The "ALL healthcare information" option is silently limited to the last 3 years. A patient seeking their complete history must use the "Specific DATES" option, but this limitation is not explained. The word "ALL" is misleading.

The 90-day default authorization expiration is adequate for patient access requests (HIPAA requires fulfillment within 30 days with one extension) but creates unnecessary re-authorization burden for ongoing provider exchanges. A conflicting 1-year expiration for the "mutual exchange" option adds confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — genuinely digital-first design
- Single-page format that fits all necessary elements concisely
- Strong scope options with granular sensitive-information exclusion controls
- Multi-clinic awareness field routing requests to the correct WWMG location
- Easy-to-find forms with a dedicated Medical Records Request page

## Overall Assessment

WWMG provides a technically competent, well-designed authorization form that is easy to find and fill out digitally. However, it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — patients must navigate a generic authorization form and select the "Personal" purpose checkbox. The vague fee language for patient access is a compliance concern. The form's document quality and digital-first design are above average, but the lack of a patient-centered access pathway keeps this from being an exemplary practice.

# Sea Mar Community Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Sea Mar Community Health Centers is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Seattle, WA. The organization publishes a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — that serves as the only downloadable pathway for patients requesting their own records. Sea Mar also offers a patient portal (MyChart) at seamar.org/ohr/index.php, though this was not evaluated as part of the form retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Sea Mar does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios — transfer of care, third-party release, and patient-initiated requests alike. The "Purpose of the release" section includes "At my request" as one option alongside "Transfer of Care" and "Verbal Disclosure," but there is no separate patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no mention of the specific protections that apply to individual access requests (fee limits, format choice, 30-day timeline). A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form that treats their legally-distinct right as just another checkbox on a general authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned a direct link to the PDF on the first attempt, and a site-scoped search confirmed no other ROI forms exist. There was no bot blocking, login wall, or CAPTCHA. The URL (`seamar.org/dl/ROI%20COPY%202022%20PDF.pdf`) uses the acronym "ROI" which patients are unlikely to recognize, but the form was immediately discoverable through search engines. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations make their forms far harder to find.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page PDF with a text layer (not a scanned image), but it has **zero fillable fields**. All entries use underscores and blank lines designed for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and return it — there are no interactive checkboxes, text inputs, or digital signature fields. The form cannot be completed digitally without third-party PDF annotation tools.

The layout is structured with labeled sections on the left side (Patient Information, From, To, Information to be released, etc.) following a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the single-page compression creates density issues with minimal whitespace. The language mixes plain directions with legal terminology — the reference to "Title 42 of the United States code" is imprecise (it should cite 42 CFR Part 2 specifically) and provides no actionable information to patients.

The instruction "Please initial one section" under record types is confusing — there are actually six initialing options, some of which patients might logically want to combine. The "All records" option excludes sensitive information without clearly cross-referencing the separate sensitive information section below, creating a two-step requirement that patients could easily miss.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is the **apparent requirement for in-person submission**. The form lists delivery methods for receiving records (In-Clinic, Verbal, CD, Paper, Fax) but provides no mailing address, fax number, or email address for submitting the completed form. The "Staff Use Only" section — with checkboxes for "Verified all sections are complete" and staff initials — strongly implies the form is designed to be completed in-clinic, in front of staff. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeline is stated. The 90-day default expiration is reasonable for a third-party authorization but conceptually irrelevant for a patient access request, since the right of access is ongoing.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular record type options**: The "Recent summary of care" itemizes specific components (Medication List, Problem List, Progress Notes, Imaging, Immunizations, screening results), giving patients a clear picture of what they'll receive.
- **Minor consent section**: A well-structured section for minors ages 13–17 to authorize release of sensitive information, with age thresholds aligned to Washington State's mature minor doctrine.
- **Easy discoverability**: The form was found on the first search attempt with no access barriers.
- **Patient rights statement**: Present, though generic — covers revocation right and no-conditioning, but does not reference individual access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Sea Mar provides a functional but paper-centric, undifferentiated pathway for patient record access. The form is easy to find online but impossible to complete digitally, and the apparent in-person submission requirement creates a meaningful barrier. The conflation of patient self-access with third-party authorization means patients receive no information about their specific rights under HIPAA's Right of Access. For an FQHC serving diverse communities, the absence of a Spanish-language version and the lack of any digital workflow are notable gaps.

# Cordova Community Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cordova Community Medical Center (CCMC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Cordova, Alaska. It offers a single Release of Information form for all medical records requests — a one-page, general-purpose HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

CCMC provides one pathway for records requests: a downloadable PDF authorization form linked from the Medical Records page at `https://www.cdvcmc.com/for-patients/medical-records/`. The form can be printed, completed by hand, and faxed to Medical Records at (907) 424-8406 or the Clinic Nurse at (907) 424-8202. No online submission portal, email submission option, or patient portal alternative exists. The website's Medical Records page reportedly discusses format options for receiving records (paper, email, CD, or fax), but the form itself does not capture a delivery format preference.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

CCMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured around "Release my information to [NAME]" — a third-party release frame. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in the recipient field and select "Personal reasons" as the purpose, which is unintuitive. The purpose checkboxes ("Continuation of care," "Insurance purposes," "Employer requirement," "Legal review") are overwhelmingly third-party scenarios. While technically usable for patient self-access, the form was clearly designed around the third-party authorization model, not individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The Medical Records page is intuitively located under "For Patients" and links directly to the form download. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, authentication, or portal login was encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a flat (non-fillable) PDF — digitally authored with a proper text layer, but with zero interactive fields. Patients must print and handwrite all entries. At one page and approximately 15 fields (patient name, DOB, MR#, recipient name/address/phone, purpose checkboxes, record type checkboxes, date range, sensitive information initial, signature, and date), the scope is reasonable. The layout uses a numbered section structure (1–7) that flows logically from authorization through scope, limitations, revocation, rights, and signature. However, the dense legal text in sections 3–7 and the redisclosure notice create a visually cramped single page. Three fonts provide some typographic hierarchy. The language shifts from accessible in the early sections to regulatory legalese in the later sections, particularly around revocation and redisclosure.

Section 2 offers excellent record-type granularity — twelve specific categories plus "Other" and date-range fields — giving patients meaningful control over what is released. Section 7's acceptance of photocopies as originals is a practical accommodation.

## Barriers

No notarization is required. Photo ID "may be required" — stated as a possibility, not an absolute mandate. No fees are mentioned on the form. The form expires three months from signature, which is short but sufficient for a single access request. There is no stated turnaround time on the form itself.

A notable concern is Section 3's all-or-nothing handling of sensitive information: alcohol/drug abuse, HIV-AIDS, mental health, and psychiatric treatment are bundled into a single initial, with an undefined "qualify above" alternative. This is problematic given the form's own citation of 42 CFR Part 2 protections for substance abuse records, which require specific consent for each disclosure.

The form's 45 CFR 164.524 citation is misapplied — used in the redisclosure context rather than to inform patients of their access rights. The form was last updated in 2016, making it nearly a decade old.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:** Excellent findability; compact single-page design; comprehensive record-type selection; photocopies accepted; fax submission available (adequate electronic pathway).

**Weaknesses:** Not fillable; does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release; sensitive information bundling; stale document (2016); delivery format not captured on form; legal language in later sections.

## Overall Assessment

CCMC provides a functional but dated records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it was designed for third-party release rather than patient self-access. The non-fillable format and print-fax workflow reflect a paper-first mindset. For a small, remote critical access hospital, the form is adequate but falls short of patient-centered design. A patient can navigate the process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary user.

# Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, a ScionHealth-affiliated for-profit community hospital in Hartsville, SC, offers two publicly available ROI forms: an English "Release of Information Authorization / Requisition Form" (form-1.pdf) and an identical Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are hosted on ScionHealth's CMS infrastructure and linked directly from the hospital's medical records page at cprmc.com/medical-records. No additional patient access forms, online portals, or digital request wizards were found. The hospital uses MRO Corp as its third-party ROI vendor for processing requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms structured around a "disclosing provider → recipient" model. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the "Name of Recipient" section with their own information — a workflow designed for third-party disclosure, not individual access. The form references 45 CFR 160 and 164 only in the context of redisclosure risk and never mentions HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524). There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no simplified self-request form, and no portal-based alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-specific web search immediately surfaced both PDF URLs, and the medical records page provides direct links alongside submission instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, or multi-click navigation was encountered. File names are descriptive (`Authorization_Update_(English).pdf`). This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — but with **zero fillable fields**. Every field must be completed by printing and handwriting. The layout is organized into two sections: Section A for patient and recipient demographics plus record type selection, and Section B for seven legal statements with a signature block. The 15-category record type checklist (face sheet, H&P, labs, imaging, etc.) with an "All Records" option provides good granularity. However, the single-page format forces dense layout with limited whitespace, and the legal statements use moderately complex language referencing CFR provisions. The form lacks instructions beyond section labels, provides no guidance on how patients will receive their records, and includes a "purpose/reason for this request" field without noting that HIPAA does not require patients to justify self-access requests.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable red flags emerge. First, Statement 6 states that patients "may need to have my physician authorize" the use or disclosure of sensitive information in their records — language that could function as an illegitimate barrier to patient access under HIPAA's Right of Access. Second, the "For Office Use Only" section includes a Social Security number field, creating unnecessary data exposure risk. The form discloses no fees, states no response timeline, and does not mention the MRO Corp third-party vendor relationship. On the positive side, no notarization is required, and submission channels include fax and email in addition to in-person delivery — adequate electronic submission options.

## Notable Strengths

The availability of a professionally translated Spanish-language form is a genuine bright spot, particularly for a community hospital. Both language versions are equally accessible from the medical records page. The granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control over their request scope. The easy online findability — direct links, descriptive URLs, no access barriers — represents a model for form availability.

## Overall Assessment

Carolina Pines provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and submit, and the Spanish translation is commendable. However, the lack of any patient self-access differentiation, zero fillable fields, concerning physician-gating language for sensitive records, and absence of fee or timeline transparency place this organization squarely in the middle tier. A patient can navigate this process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Tioga Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Tioga Medical Center, a small independent critical access hospital in Tioga, North Dakota, offers a single ROI form: an "Authorization for Release of Medical/Confidential Information" available from its Health Information Management (HIM) page at https://www.tiogahealth.org/him. The form is provided in both PDF and Word (.docx) formats. No patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form exists. The only submission options apparent from the form are fax (701-664-2646) and mail (P.O. Box 159, Tioga, ND 58852).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Tioga Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form uses a "Release From" / "Release To" structure that assumes records are moving between facilities or to a third party — not to the patient themselves. A patient requesting their own records would need to awkwardly list themselves in the "Release To" field, navigating a paradigm that was never designed for them. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no dedicated patient access pathway, and no guidance on how patients requesting their own records should complete the form. This is a textbook example of the "wrong form" problem: the organization funnels all requesters through a generic authorization form built for inter-institutional disclosure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the HIM page, and the form is directly linked with no login required. For a small critical access hospital, this represents reasonable discoverability. The only minor issue is that the download URL is a Wix-generated hash path that gives no indication of the document's content, and the HIM page provides little context about when or why a patient would use this form.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is an **image-only scan** — a CCITT fax-encoded grayscale image at 200 DPI with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers and fails basic digital accessibility standards. A patient must print the form and fill it out by hand. The availability of a Word (.docx) version partially mitigates this: a patient with Microsoft Word could type into the document, but this depends on having compatible software and the initiative to seek out the alternative format.

The form itself is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, release-from/to facility information, date range, purpose checkboxes (6 options), record type checkboxes (12 categories), sensitive records authorization, and signature lines. The 12 checkbox categories for record types — from emergency room records to clinic notes — provide genuinely useful granularity. However, a dense legal paragraph at the bottom covers revocation rights, insurance implications, and re-disclosure warnings in a single unbroken block with no visual emphasis on key patient rights.

## Barriers and Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — while not explicitly marked as required, its presence as a structured field implies it is expected. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests, and this could deter patients who lack someone available to witness. The form mentions no fees, states no response timeline, and provides no delivery format options (electronic, CD, mail). An internal tracking sidebar ("Records given □ / Number of Pages / Initials") sits unlabeled among patient-facing fields, creating potential confusion.

## Strengths

Despite its limitations, the form has some positive elements: a clear voluntariness statement ("I can refuse to sign this authorization. I need not sign this form in order to assure treatment"), explicit revocation rights, a reasonable six-month authorization window, and granular record-type selection. The dual-format availability (PDF + Word) shows some awareness of accessibility needs, even if the execution is lacking.

## Overall Assessment

Tioga Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request process that reflects the resource constraints typical of small independent critical access hospitals. The form is easy to find and covers the basics, but it is technically primitive (image-only scan), not designed for patient self-access, and includes a potentially unnecessary witness requirement. A patient could navigate this process, but they would need to print the form, handwrite their information, figure out that they belong in the "Release To" field, and fax or mail it back. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate findability cannot fully compensate for poor technical accessibility and a form paradigm that treats patient self-access as an afterthought.

# Valley Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valley Medical Group (VMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice with offices in Amherst, Easthampton, Greenfield, and Northampton, Massachusetts. For medical records requests, VMG fully delegates to **MediCopy**, a third-party Health Information Management vendor. The practice does not publish its own ROI form — instead, its website (vmgma.com) features a prominent "REQUEST RECORDS" link that redirects patients to MediCopy's patient portal at medicopy.net.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Two PDF authorization forms were found, both hosted on MediCopy's website:

- **form-1.pdf** — MediCopy's generic English-language authorization for release of medical records
- **form-2.pdf** — Spanish-language version of the same MediCopy form

MediCopy also offers an online HelloSign-based authorization (https://app.hellosign.com/s/01LCH5zj), providing a fully digital alternative to the PDF. The English PDF (form-1.pdf) is the most relevant document for assessing the patient experience, as it is the standard-language version of the form VMG patients are directed to use.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

VMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic MediCopy release-of-information authorizations designed for sending records to a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own information twice — once as the patient and again as the recipient — and select "Personal Use" from the purpose options. While "Personal Use" is listed, the form's structure (with separate "patient" and "recipient" sections) is clearly oriented toward disclosure to others. There is no dedicated patient access form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no streamlined self-request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form requires **moderate effort**. The "REQUEST RECORDS" link on vmgma.com is visible in the header and footer, which is helpful. However, clicking it sends the patient to medicopy.net — a third-party domain that may feel unfamiliar or untrustworthy. From there, the patient must navigate to MediCopy's ROI landing page to find the downloadable PDF, a 3-click cross-domain journey. A web search for "Valley Medical Group medical records request" would not surface the MediCopy form, since it contains no VMG branding whatsoever. The "Facility Name" field is blank — patients must know what to write.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (7 fonts, proper text extraction), it functions as a print-and-fill document. The layout is clean and uses conversational section headers phrased as questions ("Tell us about the patient," "What would you like released?"), which is more approachable than typical legal-heavy forms. Record type selection offers 11 checkboxes plus exclusion options for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postage.

However, the form has **no submission instructions** — no address, fax number, or email for returning the completed authorization. A patient who downloads this PDF in isolation would have no idea where to send it. The file is also disproportionately large (1.39 MB for one page).

## Barriers and Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required** — positive
- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for a records release and creates a privacy risk
- **Fee disclosure**: The English form mentions an "additional fee" for postage but provides no fee schedule; the Spanish form references 45 CFR 164.524 and mentions a "reasonable fee" but discloses no amounts
- **No response time commitment** stated
- **Default release of sensitive records**: The opt-out framing means substance abuse, HIV, and psychiatric records are released unless the patient affirmatively checks exclusion boxes

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — meaningful for a small independent practice
- **Online HelloSign alternative** exists alongside the PDF, providing a digital submission pathway
- **Email delivery option** for receiving records
- **Sensitive-information exclusion checkboxes** give patients granular control
- **Conversational, plain-language headers** make the form approachable

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No VMG branding or customization** — completely generic MediCopy form
- **No fillable fields** on the PDF despite digital creation
- **No submission instructions** on the form itself
- **SSN collection** is unnecessary and risky
- **No patient rights statement** regarding Right of Access or fee limitations
- **Poor Spanish translation** with mistranslations ("lanzado" for "released") and grammatical errors

## Overall Assessment

Valley Medical Group provides a functional but generic pathway for records requests through its MediCopy partnership. The "REQUEST RECORDS" link on the homepage is a reasonable starting point, and the availability of both a PDF form and an online HelloSign option gives patients choices. However, the complete lack of VMG customization, the absence of fillable PDF fields, missing submission instructions, and the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release all indicate a process that was outsourced without much thought given to the patient experience. The form serves its administrative purpose but does not center the patient.

# Springhill Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms & Pathways

Springhill Medical Center provides two downloadable documents from its Medical Records page: a single-page "Request for Release of Health Information" authorization form (form-1.pdf) and a generic ONC patient rights infographic (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is an actionable authorization form. The organization's Medical Records page also links to a **Zoho-based online ROI request portal** operated by MedRecs Management, and mentions a patient portal. The HIM department accepts fax submissions at 251.410.4014.

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

Springhill does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole authorization form uses a generic structure — "I hereby authorize ___ to release the following information to ___" — designed for third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in the hospital as the source and themselves as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that individual access requests have different legal requirements than third-party authorizations. The Zoho portal may offer a more tailored digital workflow, but the downloadable form funnels all requesters through a single generic pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A simple web search returned the PDF directly, and the organization's Medical Records page clearly links to both the form and the Zoho portal. No bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. However, the form URL embeds "2011-Version-1" in the filename, raising immediate questions about currency.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** — no interactive fields, no clickable checkboxes, just underscore blanks and bracket-style checkboxes requiring print-and-handwrite completion. At one page, the length is reasonable, and the logical flow (demographics → authorization → record types → delivery method → legal language → signature) is sound. However, the form is visually dated and dense, cramming all content onto a single page with small text. The language is a mix of functional and legal — mostly accessible but with a dense legal block at the bottom covering revocability, sensitive information categories, and redisclosure warnings.

The form requests approximately 20–25 fields including patient demographics, record type selections, delivery method details, and signatures. Notably, it asks for the patient's **Social Security Number**, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates a significant privacy risk.

## Barriers & Concerns

Several barriers stand out:

- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers for a medical records request creates unnecessary privacy risk, especially for forms submitted via fax or email.
- **Witness signature line**: The form includes a "Signature of Witness" field, implying a witness may be required — an unnecessary barrier with no HIPAA basis for patient-initiated requests.
- **Sensitive information bundling**: Substance abuse, psychiatric, STD, and HIV/AIDS records are bundled into the general authorization without separate opt-in, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2.
- **Outdated references**: The form still uses the legacy name "Springhill Memorial Hospital" and references "UB-92" (replaced by UB-04 in 2007), signaling a form that has not been updated in over a decade.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods**: The 2011-era form offers five delivery options — pick-up, mail, fax, patient portal, and email — which was forward-looking for its time.
- **Online portal availability**: The Zoho-based electronic request portal provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.
- **Patient rights education**: Hosting the ONC patient rights infographic shows awareness of patient access rights, even if the resource is generic.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: The form explicitly states that treatment and payment cannot be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Springhill Medical Center provides a functional but dated pathway for records access. The form is easy to find and offers multiple submission methods including fax and email, but the authorization form itself is a 15-year-old, non-fillable generic release form that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party disclosure. The SSN requirement and witness signature line create unnecessary barriers. The existence of a Zoho-based online portal is a meaningful positive, offering patients a digital alternative — though the downloadable form itself reflects a process that has not been meaningfully updated since 2011. A patient can get their records through this organization, but the experience requires navigating a form not designed for them.

# Community Health Centers of Burlington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Community Health Centers of Burlington (CHCB) provides two downloadable PDF forms for health information disclosure. **Form-1** ("Authorization to Send Health Information," revised November 2023) is the primary ROI form — a one-page, fillable PDF covering medical, mental health/psychiatric, and dental records. **Form-2** ("Authorization for Verbal Communication (Only)") is a companion form limited to verbal disclosures; it explicitly states "No paper records will be sent" and is not relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own records.

No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or web-based form wizard was identified. The primary pathway for a patient requesting records is to download form-1, complete it, and submit it — though submission instructions are notably absent from the form itself.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

CHCB does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization/disclosure form designed to serve all release purposes. However, it includes a "Patient copy" checkbox under "Reason for Release" alongside options like "Coordination of care," "Transfer care," and "Legal purposes." This checkbox normalizes patient self-access as a legitimate use case, even though the form's structure — with "Information REQUESTED FROM" and "Information RELEASED TO" blocks — is oriented toward third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate sender/recipient fields that don't map intuitively to a self-access request, creating potential confusion.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), nor does it include plain-language statements about patient rights to access their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required a site-scoped web search (`site:chcb.org`), which immediately returned a direct link to the PDF in a WordPress uploads directory. The organization's own forms page (`chcb.org/forms/`) did not render content — likely due to JavaScript rendering — meaning a patient navigating the website directly would have difficulty finding the form without resorting to a search engine. No bot-blocking or download difficulties were encountered. Findability is moderate: easily searchable but not prominently surfaced through the site's own navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-executed digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 36 interactive form fields, a clean text layer, and a modest 164 KB file size. The one-page design is impressively compact, covering three record categories (medical, mental health, dental) with date ranges, legal disclosures, and a revocation section. The layout is dense but readable, using bold headers, checkboxes, and horizontal rules to organize content.

Language is a mix of accessible plain English in the record-selection sections and standard legal boilerplate in the disclosure paragraph. The record type options are well-designed — patients can choose complete records or specify particular items, with date ranges available for medical and mental health categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

**No submission instructions.** The most significant gap is the absence of any guidance on how to submit the completed form. The header lists a fax number and email for receiving records *at* CHCB, but there is no explicit instruction for returning the completed authorization. A patient would likely have to call the office to ask. **No fees are mentioned** — neither disclosed nor waived. **No notarization** is required, and the form explicitly states that photocopies and facsimiles are valid, removing a common barrier. The conditioning-of-treatment language is legally accurate but could intimidate patients. A line about verbal communication, apparently carried over from the verbal-only companion form, creates minor confusion about what the form authorizes.

## Notable Strengths

- **"Patient copy" checkbox** explicitly normalizes patient self-access as a standard reason for release
- **One-page fillable PDF** with 36 interactive fields enables complete digital form-filling
- **Photocopy/facsimile acceptance** explicitly stated, removing an access barrier
- **Granular record selection** with date ranges gives patients control over scope
- **Revocation section** clearly states the right to revoke consent at any time

## Overall Assessment

CHCB provides a technically competent, concise authorization form that a patient *can* use to request their own records, but the experience is not designed around patient self-access. The generic disclosure framing, absence of submission instructions, lack of patient rights language, and sender/recipient confusion when used for self-access all point to a form built for provider-to-provider information exchange that accommodates patients as a secondary use case. The fillable design and compact layout are genuine strengths, but the missing submission pathway is a meaningful gap in the patient experience.

# CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital is a critical access hospital in Long Prairie, MN, part of the CentraCare regional health system based in St. Cloud. Long Prairie does not maintain its own facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it uses CentraCare's system-wide "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available from a centralized medical records release page at centracare.com. Three documents were found: the main ROI authorization form, a companion instruction sheet, and a separate substance use disorder consent form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

CentraCare does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for all releases of information — to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the "Release Information From" and "Release Information To" fields, placing themselves in the "To" field — an unintuitive workflow for someone who simply wants a copy of their own chart. There is no separate patient access request form, no dedicated section for individual access, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

That said, the form does include a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which normalizes patient self-requests and helps HIM staff route them appropriately. The companion instruction document (form-2) provides clear, section-by-section guidance written in second person, explaining not just *what* to fill in but *why* each field matters — an unusual and helpful touch.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. Web searches converged on CentraCare's centralized patient resources page, which logically organizes the forms. However, a patient searching specifically for "Long Prairie Hospital medical records form" must recognize that Long Prairie uses system-wide CentraCare forms and navigate accordingly. Direct download via automated tools (`curl`) was blocked by bot protection, requiring browser-based retrieval — a concern for assistive technologies and non-standard browsers.

## Form Document Quality

The main authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, despite its digital origins, it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand, or use third-party PDF annotation tools. This is a significant gap for a regional health system. The form has approximately 15–20 fields across patient demographics, release from/to addresses, record type checkboxes, delivery method, reason for release, and signature/date.

The layout is clean and logically structured: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Information to be Released → Special Disclosure → Preferred Method → Reason → Authorization → Revocation. Page 2 provides a comprehensive directory of all CentraCare HIM offices organized by region with fax numbers, phone, mail addresses, and a shared email. The language is mostly accessible, though the revocation paragraph contains dense legalese that may confuse patients.

## Submission and Delivery

CentraCare offers strong submission and delivery options. Completed forms can be submitted by **email** (CCHROI@CentraCare.com), **fax**, or **mail** — email submission is prominently featured and works for all locations. Records can be delivered via paper, CD, encrypted email, or MyChart portal. This is a genuinely patient-friendly set of options, particularly the encrypted email and MyChart delivery channels.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person submission requirement. No fee information is disclosed on either the form or the instructions, though the instructions reference "who may be responsible for the cost of records" without specifying amounts. No response time commitment is stated. The anti-re-release clause ("I do not authorize re-release of this information to anyone") is embedded as non-optional boilerplate rather than a patient choice. The form-3 SUD consent is an image-only scan with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers — but this is a supplementary document, not the primary pathway.

## Overall Assessment

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital provides a **functional but not patient-centered** records request process. The strong points are the multiple electronic submission channels (especially email), diverse delivery options (MyChart, encrypted email), the "Personal Use" reason checkbox, and the unusually helpful instruction document. The weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable form requiring print-and-handwrite, the absence of fee disclosure, and the lack of any patient rights information. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was designed for third-party release and the patient must adapt to it. Grade: **B**.

# OrthoCarolina — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

OrthoCarolina, an independent for-profit orthopedic practice in Charlotte, NC, offers a single generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests — whether the patient is requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party. Three versions of this form (dated 2017, 2020, and 2023) remain simultaneously available at different URLs on the organization's website. The most current version (form-1, revised 04/2023) is the primary form linked from the medical records resource page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

OrthoCarolina does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All requests flow through the same "Authorization for Access/Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under Purpose of Release, which at least signals that patient self-requests are a recognized use case. However, the mandatory recipient section ("This information is to be disclosed to the following individual or entity (MUST BE COMPLETED)") forces patients requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as the disclosure target — a design that treats self-access as just another flavor of third-party release rather than a distinct right under HIPAA § 164.524.

The form makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access, does not explain patient rights to receive records within 30 days, and does not distinguish the fee structure for patient access (which must be reasonable and cost-based) from third-party release fees.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned both the direct PDF link and OrthoCarolina's medical records resource page. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or browser fallback was needed — forms downloaded cleanly via direct URL. The main findability concern is version confusion: three nearly identical forms exist at three different public URLs with no version indicators in the filenames, no redirects from old URLs, and different fax numbers across versions (the 2017 form lists a different fax number). A patient who finds form-2 via a search engine could submit to the wrong fax number.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised as recently as April 2023, it uses underscored blank lines throughout, requiring patients to print and handwrite. A patient determined to complete it digitally would need third-party PDF annotation tools — a workaround, not a designed workflow.

The layout is dense but follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → records requested → radiology images → recipient → purpose → fee notice → delivery method → sensitive information consent → signature. However, the single-page constraint leads to cramped formatting, and the delivery method section has a known layout defect where authorization expiration language overlaps with delivery checkboxes, producing garbled text in the PDF's text layer (problematic for screen readers).

The language is mostly plain, though the sensitive-information consent and revocation clauses run together in a single dense paragraph. The newer form-1 dropped the prominent "YOU MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION" notice that appeared in both older versions — a regression in patient-rights transparency.

## Submission & Delivery

OrthoCarolina offers notably comprehensive submission and delivery options. The form can be submitted via mail, email (OrthoCarolinaMedRec@orthocarolina.com), fax, or patient portal upload. For record delivery, seven options are available: patient portal upload, email (for both records and radiology images), fax, paper mail, CD mail, and in-person pickup. This breadth — particularly the inclusion of email submission and patient portal delivery — is a genuine strength for a physician practice.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness is required. In-person delivery is not mandated. Fees are mentioned but not quantified: "Medical record copy fees are determined by both the nature/purpose of your request and the format/method of delivery." This vagueness, combined with no distinction between patient-access and third-party-release fee structures, creates a risk of overcharging for Right of Access requests. The form also includes a broad liability waiver releasing OrthoCarolina from "any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure" — standard boilerplate but potentially intimidating.

## Overall Assessment

OrthoCarolina earns credit for easy form findability, multiple submission/delivery channels (including email and portal), and a reasonably organized single-page form. However, the lack of any dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields in a 2023-vintage PDF, vague fee language, and the liability waiver embedded in a records request form collectively pull the assessment down. The organization treats patient self-access as undifferentiated from third-party release, missing an opportunity to acknowledge and streamline the exercise of a fundamental HIPAA right. The result is a serviceable but uninspired experience that a patient can navigate — but that was not designed with them in mind.

# WellSpan York Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

WellSpan York Hospital is part of WellSpan Health, a regional nonprofit health system in Pennsylvania. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms at the system level on wellspan.org. **Form-1.pdf** ("Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information," Form #2606, Rev. 08/25) is the primary system-wide form applicable to York Hospital and all other WellSpan facilities. **Form-2.pdf** ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information") is scoped exclusively to three WellSpan neighborhood hospitals (Newberry, Shrewsbury, Carlisle) and does not apply to York Hospital. The assessment below focuses on form-1.pdf as the relevant patient pathway.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WellSpan does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form or pathway distinct from third-party release. Form-1.pdf is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization with a bidirectional "Obtain from" / "Disclose to" structure designed for third-party transfers. However, the form does include a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an unusually clear statement of the right to self-access: *"I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."* This language partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated pathway, but a patient must still navigate a form framed around releasing records to another party and figure out how to adapt it for self-access (e.g., writing their own name in the "Disclose to" field).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A straightforward web search immediately returned a direct PDF link on wellspan.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. Multiple search strategies all converged on the same document. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1.pdf is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a complete text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally created, all fields are blank underscored lines, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient identification flows into record source/destination, then record type selection, purpose, delivery format, sensitive-records disclosure, legal terms, signatures, and submission instructions. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records paragraph on page 1 is a dense run-on sentence that could benefit from formatting improvements.

Record type options are well structured with five top-level categories (Abstract with detailed sub-list, Diagnostic Test Results, Imaging, Billing, and Complete record). Delivery format options are a standout feature: patients can choose Paper, CD, Fax, or Email, where the email option delivers records through a secure portal as PDFs available for 30 days.

## Barriers & Compliance

The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's SSN — an unnecessary data collection practice that introduces privacy risk without being required for patient identification. A witness signature line on page 2 creates ambiguity about whether a witness is routinely required or only for specific circumstances. Fees are mentioned as "regulated by state and federal law" but no specific amounts are disclosed. Notably, form processing is handled by MRO Corporation, a third-party ROI vendor, meaning patients interact with MRO rather than WellSpan directly.

On the positive side: the form explicitly accepts copies in lieu of originals, does not require notarization, and clearly states that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing. The 12-month authorization window is reasonable.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit the completed form via **fax** (717-812-8119), **email** (PatientRequests@wellspan.org), or **mail** to the York, PA HIM office. The availability of fax and email means patients are not required to physically visit the facility or rely solely on postal mail.

## Overall Assessment

WellSpan York Hospital provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed authorization form with modern delivery options (secure portal) and explicit right-to-self language. However, the absence of fillable fields in a born-digital PDF, the generic third-party authorization structure, the SSN collection, and witness ambiguity prevent it from reaching the top tier. The organization serves patients adequately but has clear room for improvement in both digital accessibility and patient-centered design.

# Rhode Island Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rhode Island Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Providence, RI, is part of the Brown University Health system (formerly Lifespan). Two PDF forms were retrieved: a system-wide "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" form (form-1, updated October 2024) and a department-specific imaging-records release form (form-2, Lifespan Medical Imaging, revised February 2023). Form-1 is the primary form relevant to a patient requesting their own records from Rhode Island Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Rhode Island Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both retrieved forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. The primary form (form-1) frames the workflow around disclosing records *to* a named recipient ("To release to:"), which is the structure of a third-party authorization — not a patient self-access request. While the form does include "Patient Request" as a purpose checkbox (Section 4), a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in their own name as both the patient and the recipient. There is no separate form, section, or process that recognizes individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 as distinct from authorized disclosure to third parties.

The hospital does maintain a dedicated medical records request webpage at `brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records` with contact information, which is a helpful navigation aid. However, this page directs patients to the same generic authorization form rather than offering a simplified patient-access workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the primary form, and a site-specific search confirmed the URL and identified the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or other access barriers were encountered. The PDF was directly downloadable from a public URL. This is a strong point — many organizations make form discovery far more difficult.

## Form Document Quality

**Fillability**: The primary form is a born-digital PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being a recently updated document (October 2024), patients must print it and complete all fields by hand. This is a missed opportunity given the form's digital origin — adding interactive fields would be trivial.

**Layout and organization**: Form-1 uses a logical 11-section numbered structure covering facility selection, recipient, dates, purpose, format, record types, exclusions, and legal terms — all compressed onto a single page. The structure is clear, but the density is high, with legal boilerplate competing for space with patient-facing fields.

**Language**: The legal sections (8–11) use standard but dense regulatory language. No plain-language summary, explanatory guidance, or patient-friendly instructions are provided. A patient without familiarity with HIPAA authorization forms would likely find the legal sections intimidating.

**Record format options**: Limited to "paper" or "CD disc" — no electronic delivery option (email, portal, secure link) is offered. This is notable for a 2024 form, especially given HIPAA's requirement to provide records in the electronic format requested if readily producible.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Broad liability waiver**: Section 9 requires patients to "release Brown University Health, its employees and my physicians from all liability arising from this disclosure of my health information." Bundling a blanket liability release into a records authorization is aggressive and may discourage patients from exercising their access rights.
- **Vague fee language**: The form notes "There may be a fee associated with this request" without specifying amounts, providing a fee schedule, or distinguishing between patient-access fees (HIPAA-capped) and third-party release fees.
- **No electronic delivery**: Offering only paper and CD in 2024 creates a barrier for patients seeking digital access.
- **Out-of-state contact numbers**: Status inquiry numbers route to Massachusetts and California area codes, suggesting outsourced ROI processing — potentially confusing for Providence-based patients.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record-type selection**: ~10 specific record categories plus a behavioral health subsection, with a helpful "Abstract" definition footnote, give patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.
- **Sensitive information protections**: Five categories of sensitive information (sexual abuse, mental health, STIs, substance use, HIV) can be excluded, respecting both 42 CFR Part 2 and Rhode Island state law.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: A single form covers all Brown University Health facilities with clear checkboxes, avoiding the need to locate separate forms.
- **Easy findability**: Forms are prominently available online with no access barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Rhode Island Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and logically organized, but it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual access rights — through a generic third-party authorization workflow. The absence of fillable fields, electronic delivery options, and a patient-access-specific pathway places it squarely in the middle of the pack. The embedded liability waiver and vague fee language are concerning, though the granular record-type options and sensitive-information protections are commendable. A patient can successfully request records, but the process was clearly designed for institutional disclosure workflows rather than patient self-service.

# Lincoln Hospital (Davenport, WA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lincoln Hospital, a small government-owned critical access hospital in rural eastern Washington, publishes two ROI forms on its Health Records page: a **clinics version** (form-1.pdf) for records held at North Basin Medical Clinics and a **hospital version** (form-2.pdf) for hospital records. Both are titled "Authorization for Release of Health Care Information and Records" and share nearly identical structure and legal boilerplate. The forms are reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Health Records), making them reasonably easy to find.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information — the page 1 structure asks patients to specify a recipient for records, with fields for the recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. Page 2 of each form includes an "ACCESS REQUEST" section that acknowledges the patient's right to inspect and obtain copies of their own records, making the forms technically dual-purpose. However, a patient requesting their own records receives no clear guidance on how to fill out the third-party-oriented page 1 — should they list themselves as the recipient? The form doesn't say. The "At the request of the Patient" purpose checkbox and "Given to Patient" delivery option exist but are not prominently featured as a distinct pathway.

## Form Document Quality

The hospital form (form-2.pdf) is the technically superior document: it has a full text layer (7,364 characters extractable), making it screen-reader accessible and searchable. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. The clinics form (form-1.pdf) is worse: a scanned image of a paper document with no extractable text whatsoever, rendering it completely inaccessible to assistive technology.

Both forms are 2 pages and reasonably organized. Page 1 uses labeled sections (Types of Information, Purpose, Revocation, Re-Disclosure, No Conditions, Time Frame, Consent of Minor) with clear visual hierarchy. The language mixes plain English with necessary legal terminology; sections like the "No Conditions" statement are clear, while the sensitive-information preamble is dense legalese. The hospital form's "OFFICE USE" section appears near patient-facing fields without clear labeling, potentially confusing patients about what they need to fill out.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were found through web search and confirmed on the hospital website. The Health Records page returned a 403 error to automated fetch tools (likely bot blocking), requiring browser access, but loaded normally in a standard browser. One alternate URL for the clinics form returned HTTP 400, suggesting stale links. Overall findability was good — a patient navigating the website would locate these forms without difficulty.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant concern is the **fee structure**. The clinics form cites Washington's WAC 246-08-400 fee schedule ($26.00 search/base fee, $1.17/page for first 30 pages, $0.88/page thereafter plus tax) — fees designed for third-party record duplication that likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests. Worse, this fee schedule references dates of September 2017 through June 2019, making it nearly seven years expired. The hospital form takes a different approach: its fee field reads "$______ per page" with the amount left blank — unhelpful for patients trying to anticipate costs.

The clinics form requires patients to attach a copy of photo identification, which goes beyond HIPAA requirements and creates an additional burden. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both forms correctly state a 30-day response time (60 days for off-site records) with one possible 30-day extension, aligning with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

The clinics form offers electronic delivery options — "MyChart Secure Patient Portal, CD, USB Flash Drive (provided by patient)" — a notably progressive feature for a small rural critical access hospital. The "Most recent two (2) years" date range shortcut with specific clinical examples (colonoscopy, mammogram, DEXA, diabetic exams) is patient-friendly. Both forms include an explicit "No Conditions" statement and detailed minor consent provisions aligned with Washington State law.

## Overall Assessment

Lincoln Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and include some thoughtful patient-facing features (electronic delivery options, clinical shortcuts), but fundamental issues undermine the experience: no fillable fields on either form, a generic third-party authorization structure that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, potentially excessive fees, and one form that is an image-only scan. The organization deserves credit for acknowledging patient access rights on page 2 of each form but falls short of providing a clear, patient-centric access pathway.

# Colquitt Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Colquitt Regional Medical Center (Moultrie, GA) is an independent, government-owned community hospital. The organization offers a single downloadable PDF form for medical records requests, found on its Health Records & Patient Portal page. No online portal, patient portal integration, or alternative digital pathway was identified for requesting records.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was retrieved: an "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for releasing records to third parties. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a patient portal–based records request workflow. The sole pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — though the form itself provides no submission instructions (no fax number, mailing address, or email).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as an authorization for disclosure to a named recipient (item 5 asks for recipient "Name" and "Address"). While item 6 includes a "my personal records" purpose checkbox — a helpful nod toward self-access — the form does not explain what a patient should enter as the recipient when requesting their own records. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of patient access rights, and no separate pathway or instructions for patients who simply want their own medical records. A patient must navigate a form designed for third-party release and adapt it to their self-access needs.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped search quickly identified the Health Records & Patient Portal page, and the form was linked with a clearly labeled "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button — approximately two clicks from the homepage. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy**, and no bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page scanned image** with no meaningful text layer (only 11 characters of noise extracted) and zero fillable fields. It was created in 2021 using scanning software ("Transform Foundation Server"), confirming it is a digitized paper form rather than a digitally authored document. The form is completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology, cannot be filled digitally, and must be printed and completed by hand.

Despite the poor technical quality, the content design is adequate. The 10-item numbered list provides a logical flow: patient identification → who may disclose → record types → sensitive information acknowledgment → recipient → purpose → legal terms → signatures. Twelve record-type checkboxes offer useful granularity. The language mixes plain English with some legal phrasing — mostly readable but occasionally dense (e.g., the revocation paragraph). There are no section headers, boxes, or visual groupings to aid navigation, but the single-page length keeps complexity manageable.

## Barriers

- **No submission instructions**: The form contains no fax number, mailing address, email, or department name. A patient downloading the form has no guidance on how to return it. The website's Health Records page may provide this information, but it is absent from the form itself.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" line is present, which may lead patients to believe a witness is required — HIPAA does not require this for patient access requests.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form makes no mention of fees or costs for records.
- **No date range field**: Patients cannot specify a time period for the records they want.
- **No delivery format options**: No choices for electronic vs. paper delivery.

## Bright Spots

- **Easy findability**: The form was prominently linked from a clearly labeled page.
- **Voluntariness statement**: Item 10 explicitly states that signing is voluntary and will not affect treatment.
- **Patient-controlled expiration**: Item 8 lets the patient set their own authorization expiration date.
- **"My personal records" purpose checkbox**: While the form is generic, this option at least acknowledges that patients may be requesting their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Colquitt Regional Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request pathway. The form is easy to find, but it is a scanned image that cannot be filled digitally, lacks submission instructions, and does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The technical quality is poor — an image-only scan with no fillable fields and no accessibility support. A patient attempting to request their own records faces a form not designed for their use case, must print and handwrite their responses, and receives no guidance on how to submit the completed form. The organization earns credit for findability and a few patient-friendly touches (voluntariness statement, patient-controlled expiration), but the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# Heartland Community Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Heartland Community Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Lawrence, Kansas, serving patients across three locations. The organization provides a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" — for all records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party release.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page PDF titled "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" (form-1.pdf), hosted in the organization's WordPress uploads directory. This form serves all release purposes — patient access, provider-to-provider transfers, insurance disputes, and referrals. A "Patient's Request" checkbox appears among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Records From" and "Records To" fields) is oriented around third-party transfer rather than individual access. A patient requesting records for personal use would find it unclear how to complete the "Records To" section.

Submission options are reasonable: email (medrecords@heartlandhealth.org), fax (785-856-0375), and mail. A phone line for questions (785-842-4477, Option 5) is also provided. These multiple channels meet the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was not discoverable through generic web searches but was found via a site-scoped search (`site:heartlandhealth.org`). The URL is descriptive and the download was straightforward once located. The form is not prominently linked from obvious patient-facing pages — it lives in a WordPress uploads directory, suggesting it may be embedded on an interior page but is not surfaced in primary navigation or a patient resources section.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally-created, single-page PDF with a full text layer — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it functions as a print-and-handwrite document. The layout is logically ordered (demographics → record types → delivery method → from/to → purpose → legal disclosures → signature → return instructions) and fits everything onto a single page, though the density is high with 16 fonts and tight spacing.

The form uses approximately 20+ data entry points (name, DOB, address, phones, date ranges, multiple checkbox groups, records from/to blocks, signature lines). The opening line — "To treat you effectively, your provider needs to review your past medical records" — is patient-friendly, though it subtly frames the form around incoming records transfer rather than patient-initiated access.

One notable design feature is the pre-bundled "Record Set" option, which offers a thoughtfully curated default bundle (last 3 visit notes, recent labs, medication list, immunization records, screening reports, and specialist list). This reduces decision burden for patients who want comprehensive records.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Witness requirement**: A "Witness" signature line is present but never explicitly stated as required. Its inclusion may deter patients or create confusion about whether a witness is actually needed.

**Mental health records**: These require a completely separate form and cannot be combined with other record types on the same submission, creating an additional barrier for patients seeking comprehensive records.

**Email liability disclaimers**: Two separate liability waivers for email delivery appear on the form, which may discourage patients from choosing this convenient option.

**Fees**: No fees are mentioned anywhere on the form — neither disclosed nor waived.

**Compliance language**: The form properly addresses revocation rights, 12-month expiration, treatment non-conditioning, and re-disclosure warnings. However, it does not reference the patient's Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Overall Assessment

Heartland Community Health Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The form is accessible online (with some searching), offers multiple submission channels, and includes some patient-friendly elements like the pre-bundled record set and plain-language opening. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party release framing, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of any dedicated patient access pathway all work against patient-centeredness. The form is adequate for its purpose but was not designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. For an FQHC serving a population that may face literacy or technology barriers, the non-fillable format and dense layout represent meaningful obstacles.

# Baptist Health Lexington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Baptist Health Lexington is a community hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, part of the Baptist Health (Kentucky) system. It does not maintain facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it relies on system-wide forms published by the parent system at baptisthealth.com. Three documents were retrieved, all system-level.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found:

1. **Form 1 (Primary):** "Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — the current system-wide authorization form, revised February 2026. A 3-page, dual-purpose document covering both patient self-access ("Myself" checkbox) and third-party release ("Other person/organization" checkbox). Includes delivery method options (paper, fax, email, CD, MyChart), record type packages, sensitive information consent, and a helpful "Tips" page. Submission is via fax or mail to a centralized Release of Information office in Louisville.

2. **Form 2:** "Request for Medical Records" — a simpler, 1-page patient-access-specific form hosted on the MyChart portal (mychart.baptist-health.org). Explicitly framed for patients requesting their own records. Dated July 2019, making it nearly seven years old. Notably, it contains no submission instructions — no address, fax number, or email.

3. **Form 3:** An older, undated version of the same system-wide authorization (Form 1). Two pages, still publicly accessible alongside the 2026 version at a non-versioned URL, creating potential patient confusion.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Baptist Health demonstrates partial differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (Form 1) is a generic HIPAA authorization, but it clearly labels a "Myself" option on its first page and notes that purpose of release is "not required if being disclosed directly to patient." A dedicated patient access form (Form 2) does exist but is outdated and lacks submission instructions, making it less useful in practice. The primary pathway a patient would encounter — through the medical records page at baptisthealth.com — is the generic authorization form with a patient self-access checkbox.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Basic web searches and the organization's medical records page led directly to downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The only friction is that a patient searching specifically for "Baptist Health Lexington" must recognize that the parent system's form applies. The coexistence of old and new form versions at similar URLs is a minor navigational hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (Form 1) is digitally authored with a text layer and clean typography, but has **zero fillable fields**. All entry areas are blank lines and non-interactive checkbox graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is well-organized with clear section headers (Patient Info, Release To / Delivery Method, Purpose, Information to Release) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. The record type "Package" system (Key Documentation vs. All Documentation) with detailed descriptions is genuinely helpful. The third page ("Tips for Requesting Medical Record Copies") provides useful practical guidance including a 15-calendar-day turnaround goal, MyChart default delivery, and contact information.

Language is mostly plain on page 1 but dense with required legal text on page 2 — HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder (42 CFR Part 2), revocation rights, and re-disclosure warnings. The sensitive information consent is bundled as an all-or-nothing authorization with no opt-out for individual categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Not fillable:** Despite being digitally created, no forms offer interactive fields — a significant missed opportunity.
- **SSN collection:** The last 4 digits of SSN are requested without being marked optional, exceeding what HIPAA requires for patient identification.
- **Sensitive information bundling:** The authorization bundles consent for mental health, HIV/AIDS, and substance use disorder records with no ability to exclude specific categories.
- **Outdated form still live:** Form 3 (undated older version) remains publicly accessible and could lead patients to use a superseded form with a potentially incorrect mailing address.
- **No fees mentioned:** While appropriate for patient access under HIPAA, the absence of any fee information leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart as default delivery:** If no delivery method is specified, records default to the patient's Baptist Health MyChart account — a patient-friendly, electronic-first approach.
- **Package-based record selection:** The tiered Package 1/Package 2 system with clear descriptions simplifies an inherently complex choice.
- **Toll-free phone support:** Contact information includes both local and toll-free numbers, plus a dedicated MyChart support line.
- **15-day turnaround goal:** Proactively commits to a faster-than-required timeline (HIPAA allows 30 days).
- **Multiple delivery options:** Paper, fax, email, CD, and MyChart cover a wide range of patient preferences.

## Overall Assessment

Baptist Health Lexington, through its parent system, provides a competent but conventional records request process. The primary form is well-organized and clearly accommodates patient self-access, but the reliance on a non-fillable PDF and fax/mail submission keeps this firmly in the traditional paper-workflow category. The existence of a dedicated patient access form (Form 2) shows awareness of the distinction, but its outdated status and missing submission instructions undercut its value. The bright spots — MyChart default delivery, helpful tips page, and clear package descriptions — demonstrate patient-centered thinking within the constraints of a legacy form design.

# Synthesis: Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center

## Overview

Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Far Rockaway, NY. Three documents were found on the organization's website: the primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a bilingual patient exit survey (form-2), and a general HIPAA consent/NPP acknowledgment form (form-3). Only form-1 functions as an actual records request authorization.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Addabbo does not offer a pathway designed specifically for patient self-access. The sole records request mechanism is **OCA Official Form No. 960**, a New York State standard "Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA." This is a general-purpose third-party authorization form — originally designed for litigation — that patients must repurpose when requesting their own records. The form includes "At request of individual" as one checkbox among several reasons for release, but it does not distinguish between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party seeking records. The instruction page explicitly states the form was designed for "release of health information needed for litigation in New York State courts" and "can, however, be used more broadly."

The form does not reference the patient's right to receive their own records, does not offer format or delivery options (electronic, paper, CD), and does not mention a patient portal. It collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient self-access and creates privacy risk.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. The organization's website has a dedicated Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`) accessible through the "For Patients" navigation menu. However, the forms are hosted on a third-party platform (Practice Builders / `pbformsonline.com`) via a JavaScript-based PDF viewer, requiring browser DevTools inspection to obtain the actual PDF download URL. A patient could fill the form within the embedded viewer, but downloading for offline completion requires technical sophistication.

A potential confusion point: the Patient Forms page labels form-3 as "HIPAA Consent to Release Information," which could mislead patients into downloading a registration consent form instead of the actual ROI authorization.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **fillable PDF** with 25 interactive fields, though none have accessible name attributes (degrading screen reader usability). The form is 2 pages — one page of authorization content and one page of litigation-context instructions. This is appropriately concise.

The form's structure front-loads six numbered legal disclosures (HIV redisclosure warnings, revocation rights, voluntariness) before any patient-fillable fields, creating a dense, legalistic opening. The language throughout is complex — written for attorneys, not patients. Item 6's all-caps restriction on discussing health information "WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SPECIFIED IN ITEM 9(b)" is confusing in a non-litigation context.

A notable bright spot: Addabbo added a **typed-signature acceptance clause**, allowing patients to complete and sign the form digitally without printing. This is a meaningful accommodation for remote submission. The form also provides a clear enumeration of what "entire medical record" includes and granular opt-in initialing for sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug treatment, mental health, HIV).

## Barriers

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number — unnecessary for patient self-access and a privacy risk.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. While this avoids imposing excessive fees, it also doesn't inform patients of their cost-limited rights.
- **No submission method specified on form**: The form itself does not indicate how to submit. The website context and Practice Builders platform provide some guidance, but submission via fax or in-person delivery appears to be expected.
- **Exit survey co-location**: The "We're Listening" exit survey (form-2) is posted alongside the ROI form on the Medical Records page, framing all records requests as patient transfers. If presented as a companion requirement, this could function as an implicit barrier. The survey contains pervasive Spanish translation errors.

## Bright Spots

- Typed-signature acceptance removes the print-sign-scan barrier
- Explicit enumeration of medical record contents gives patients clarity
- Granular sensitive-information opt-in via initialing
- Bilingual exit survey (despite translation quality issues) reflects community awareness
- Dedicated Medical Records page with direct link to the ROI form

## Overall Assessment

Addabbo provides a functional but imperfect pathway for patient records access. The organization relies on a state-standard litigation authorization form rather than creating a patient-centered access process. The form is fillable with typed-signature support — a meaningful digital accommodation — but the legalistic language, SSN collection, litigation framing, and lack of patient access rights language place the experience squarely in "adequate but not designed for you" territory. The retrieval experience is reasonable, though the third-party form hosting and confusingly labeled companion documents create unnecessary friction.

# Alabama Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Alabama Medical Group, P.C. is an independent, for-profit, multi-specialty physician practice based in Mobile, Alabama. The organization maintains a well-organized website with a dedicated Patient Resources section, including a clearly labeled "Request Medical Records" page. Two forms were found and evaluated: a general-purpose "Request for Release of Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a narrow "Permission to Give Medical Information" form (form-2.pdf) for authorizing family phone access. Only form-1 is relevant for a patient seeking their own records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Third-Party Authorization

Alabama Medical Group does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-1, a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form titled "Request for Release of Information." The form is structured around "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" fields — language designed for inter-provider and third-party transfers, not for a patient requesting their own records. A patient would need to place their own name and address in the "Release To" field, which is workable but not intuitive.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access anywhere on the form. The form frames the entire interaction as consent-to-release rather than as an exercise of a legal right. The purpose checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Evaluation & Treatment, Other) further confirm this is designed for third-party scenarios — a patient requesting their own records would likely select "Other" and write in an explanation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The website is well-organized with a clear path: Patient Resources → Medical Records → Request Medical Records. The form is linked directly from that page as a PDF download. The same form also appears on the "Other Patient Forms" page. No bot blocking, no browser fallback needed, and no significant difficulties were encountered. The duplicate hosting (identical file at two URLs uploaded one month apart) is a minor organizational issue but does not impair access.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but **no fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects patient name (including maiden name), date of birth, Social Security Number, medical record number, recipient/source information with address/phone/fax, purpose, type of information (free-text), sensitive information consent, and multiple signature lines. The field count is approximately 15–18 data points.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow and fits on one page, though this density makes it somewhat cramped. Language is a mix of plain English for identification fields and standard legal boilerplate for the authorization terms. The example prompt for specifying record type — "(Example: Office Notes, Labs, In-Office Testing, all records)" — is a helpful touch. The dual signature block for sensitive information consent (specifically permitting vs. specifically not permitting) gives patients clear control.

However, the form lacks submission instructions — no mailing address, fax number, or email address is printed on it. A patient who downloads the PDF would not know how to return it without navigating back to the website or calling the office. There is also no date range field, no delivery format options, and no mention of electronic delivery.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests a Social Security Number as a standard field, which is unnecessary for a medical records request and creates an identity theft risk. The **employee/witness signature line** at the bottom is ambiguous — if required, it would effectively mandate in-person submission, a significant barrier not required by HIPAA. **No fees are mentioned** on the form, which leaves uncertainty about costs. **No response time** is stated.

The form was uploaded in February 2018 and has apparently not been updated since, suggesting the organization has not revisited its records request process in approximately eight years.

## Notable Strengths

- Easy findability with clear website navigation
- Concise one-page form
- Helpful example text for record type specification
- Clean sensitive information consent design with explicit opt-in/opt-out

## Overall Assessment

Alabama Medical Group provides a **functional but dated** records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it funnels patients through a generic third-party release authorization with no acknowledgment of patient access rights. The flat PDF with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no electronic submission pathway creates a primarily paper-based workflow. The SSN collection and ambiguous witness requirement are concerning. This is a practice that has not modernized its records access process to reflect current patient expectations or HIPAA right-of-access principles.

# JPS Health Network — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

JPS Health Network (John Peter Smith Hospital) is a government-owned community hospital in Fort Worth, TX. The organization's Patient Records page offers three downloadable forms: a primary ROI authorization form (English, with a Spanish version also available), an HIE opt-in authorization, and an HIE revocation form. Only the ROI form (form-1) is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records.

## Forms & Pathways

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is a single-page **Authorization & Request for Release of Information** PDF (form-1.pdf), last revised October 2018. This is a generic ROI form — it does not differentiate between patient self-access requests under HIPAA § 164.524 and third-party release authorizations. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no patient portal pathway mentioned on the records page.

The two HIE-related forms (form-2 and form-3) are irrelevant to patient self-access — they govern provider-to-provider data sharing via a health information exchange.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The Patient Records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records), and web searches also surface the direct PDF URL. The page uses accordion sections to organize content, with the ROI form under "JPS Authorization Form." Fee information and submission instructions are disclosed on the page before download — a transparency positive.

## Form Document Quality

The ROI form is the weakest element of JPS's patient access process. It is an **image-only scan** — a photograph of a paper form with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no extractable text (literally 1 character of output from text extraction). At 478 KB for a single page, it is technically a picture, not a document. It cannot be completed digitally, is invisible to screen readers, and fails basic digital accessibility standards.

The irony is sharp: JPS's 2025 HIE forms demonstrate the organization can produce modern, fillable, text-searchable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The core ROI form — the one patients actually need — remains a 2018 scan that has not been updated in over seven years.

The form is one page, which is an appropriate length. However, because it is an image-only scan, detailed analysis of layout, language clarity, field count, and instructions is limited to visual inspection rather than text analysis.

## Access Pathway Assessment

JPS does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The single ROI form appears to serve all release purposes. The fee schedule on the web page does not distinguish between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees (which Texas state law governs at higher rates). This conflation is a significant patient-centeredness gap.

Submission is limited to **print, handwrite, and mail or fax**. The Patient Records page explicitly states: "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time." Fax is available (which counts as an adequate electronic pathway and avoids the worst penalties), but the form itself cannot be filled digitally — it must be printed and handwritten.

## Barriers

- **Potentially excessive fees**: $30 for the first 10 pages, per-page charges thereafter, and a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery. The $75 electronic delivery fee likely exceeds HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based" standard for patient access requests. The fee schedule does not distinguish patient access from third-party requests.
- **No electronic form submission**: Despite having the technical capability (demonstrated by HIE forms accepting encrypted email), JPS refuses electronic submission of the ROI form.
- **Government photo ID required at pickup**: Standard practice but limits delivery to in-person collection.
- **Stale form**: Over 7 years old, predating HHS Right of Access enforcement actions and 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish language version** available for the ROI form, appropriate for Fort Worth demographics.
- **Fee disclosure** is transparent — patients know costs before downloading the form.
- **Easy findability** — the form is prominent and well-organized on the website.
- **HIE forms show capability** — the 2025 HIE forms prove JPS can do better, which makes the outdated ROI form a choice rather than a limitation.

## Overall Assessment

JPS Health Network presents a frustrating contradiction. The organization clearly has the technical capability and institutional will to produce modern, accessible digital forms — the 2025 HIE forms are well-designed, fillable, and accept encrypted email submission. Yet the core ROI form that patients actually need to request their own records remains a seven-year-old image scan with no digital functionality. Combined with potentially excessive fees and no electronic submission, the patient experience is well below what this organization could deliver. The form is easy to find, and fax submission is available, but the document itself is a relic that creates unnecessary barriers for patients exercising their access rights.

# Bayshore Medical Center — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Bayshore Medical Center, part of the Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) system, routes patients through the system-wide infrastructure for medical records requests. Six documents were retrieved during the search process, but only two are directly relevant for a Bayshore patient requesting their own records: the **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary English pathway) and the **CMR-003 authorization form** (form-6, a 2-page PDF covering all 11 HMH hospitals). A Spanish companion form (CMR-003S, form-3) mirrors the English PDF. Additional documents include an older Medical Group outpatient release form (form-1, dated 2018), two forms from sister facility Pascack Valley (forms 2 and 5), and a records amendment form (form-4).

The primary pathway for English-speaking patients is the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, linked from the HMH system-wide Medical Records page under "Request Records." Spanish-speaking patients are directed to the CMR-003S PDF download. Notably, the English PDF version of CMR-003 is **not linked** from the Medical Records page — it was found only through web search under an inconsistent URL path (medical-group/patient-forms rather than patients-visitors).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Bayshore does not offer a dedicated patient self-access PDF form. The CMR-003 PDF is a generic HIPAA authorization framed around third-party disclosure: "I authorize Hackensack Meridian Health to release information to: Organization/Recipient." A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name as the "recipient" and select "Personal use" from five purpose options — an awkward workaround. The online portal (Swellbox/Datavant) likely provides a more patient-centric experience as the primary pathway, but the PDF form does not distinguish between individual access and third-party release.

Interestingly, Pascack Valley Medical Center (an HMH sister facility) offers a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-5) with patient-first language and a "Myself" default recipient option. This demonstrates that the HMH system has the concept of a dedicated patient-access form but has not standardized it across all facilities.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the relevant forms required significant effort. The search involved web searches, site-specific navigation, URL pattern guessing, and cross-facility comparison. The Bayshore Medical Center sub-page links to the HMH Medical Records page (2–3 clicks), which prominently features the Swellbox portal but buries the PDF forms. The English CMR-003 was located via web search under the Medical Group directory — a misleading location for a hospital-level form. Retrieval difficulty: **hard**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary PDF form (CMR-003, form-6) is a born-digital 2-page document with a clean text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print and hand-write all entries. This is particularly notable given that HMH's own amendment form (form-4) has 54 fillable fields — proving the organization has the capability but did not apply it to the ROI form. The layout is logically structured with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient info → recipient → location → records → purpose → sensitive-record consent → signature → delivery format. Record type granularity is good (11 categories) and delivery format options are comprehensive (paper, encrypted USB/CD, fax, secured email).

Language is a mix of plain and legal. Core instructions are clear, but the minor consent section and legal disclosures use dense, nested phrasing. The form lacks explicit submission instructions — while the contact directory on page 2 lists HIM phone and fax numbers for each campus, the form never tells patients *how* to submit the completed authorization. The fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee… Please ask."

## Barriers and Bright Spots

No notarization, in-person submission, or witness requirements exist. Fax submission is available (Bayshore HIM fax: 732-888-7332), providing an adequate electronic pathway. The vague fee disclosure and absent submission instructions are minor barriers.

The standout bright spot is the **EHI Export option** — an explicit offer to provide records in a machine-readable format uploadable to another EHR. This is exceptionally rare on ROI forms and directly supports 21st Century Cures Act interoperability goals (despite the typo "Electric" instead of "Electronic" Health Record). The Spanish companion form, comprehensive contact directory, and granular sensitive-record consent are additional strengths.

## Overall Assessment

Bayshore Medical Center, via HMH, provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox/Datavant portal offers a digital-first primary pathway, and the PDF form — while non-fillable and oriented toward third-party release — includes progressive features like EHI Export and multilingual availability. The main weaknesses are the difficult findability of the English PDF, the generic authorization framing that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, and the lack of fillable fields on a form that could easily support them. Grade: **B**.

# ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

ENT & Allergy Associates is a large for-profit physician practice with 80+ offices across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Despite its size, the organization provides one of the poorest records-request experiences in this study. The sole ROI form is a 17-year-old Microsoft Word document buried on the website with no visible link, no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no pathway designed for patients requesting their own records.

## Forms & Pathways

Two documents were retrieved:

1. **form-1.pdf** (the ROI form): "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA" — a 2-page generic third-party release authorization. Originally a `.doc` file created in 2009, converted to PDF for this study. This is the only records-release mechanism available.
2. **form-2.pdf** (not an ROI form): "Patient Acknowledgment Form – Allergy Form Completion Fee" — a $25 fee acknowledgment for physician form completion (school/activity clearance). Found in the footer under the misleading label "Allergy Authorization Form."

There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The only pathway is downloading a Word document and figuring out independently how to submit it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for releasing records to a named third party. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in Item 8 ("Name and address of person(s) or category of person to whom this information will be sent"), which is unintuitive and not explained anywhere. The form contains no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights statement specific to individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient may simply want to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was exceptionally difficult. The website has no "Patient Forms," "Medical Records," or "Request Your Records" section. The FAQ mentions medical records only in the context of retention policies. The footer link labeled "Allergy Authorization Form" leads to the fee acknowledgment (form-2), not the ROI form. The actual ROI form exists at an orphaned URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) not linked from any navigable page — it was only discoverable through a targeted `filetype:doc` web search. A patient browsing the website would have no path to this form.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a Word `.doc` file with zero fillable fields, requiring patients to either print and handwrite or type into the Word template. The layout uses a numbered list but lacks visual hierarchy — no section headers, minimal bold, and no section dividers. Language is moderately dense legalese with constructions like "except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization." Item 6 is entirely in ALL-CAPS and contains a typo ("THEN" instead of "THE"). The form collects approximately 12–15 pieces of information, including the patient's Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection point that creates a privacy risk.

## Barriers & Red Flags

- **No submission instructions whatsoever.** The form provides no address, fax number, email, or portal link. A patient who manages to find and complete it has no guidance on how to return it.
- **SSN requested.** Unnecessary for identity verification in records requests and a data security risk.
- **Severely outdated.** Last modified January 2009 — predates the HITECH Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the ONC Information Blocking Rule.
- **Confusing Item 6.** The ALL-CAPS restriction on discussing health information could be read to limit the provider's ability to discuss records even with the patient themselves.

## Bright Spots

- **Proper handling of sensitive categories.** The form correctly requires separate initialing for HIV, substance abuse, and mental health records, with anti-redisclosure language and civil rights contact information per NY/NJ state law.
- **Anti-conditioning statement.** Item 4 clearly states treatment and benefits will not be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

ENT & Allergy Associates presents a deeply patient-unfriendly records request experience. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, an outdated Word document format, zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no patient-access-specific pathway means that a patient attempting to request their records online would face barriers at every step. For a practice of this size and market presence, this represents a significant gap in patient-centered service. **Grade: D.**

# Northwest Colorado Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Northwest Colorado Health is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms on its website: one for behavioral health records (form-1) and one for medical/dental records (form-2). Both are single-page PDFs available from a dedicated patient forms page. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient-access form — both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any release of information, whether to the patient themselves or to a third party.

## Access Pathway

Northwest Colorado Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Request Information FROM" / "Release Information TO" structure, treating a patient requesting their own records identically to someone authorizing release to an insurer, attorney, or another provider. The "Release Information TO" section does list "Self / Legal Guardian" as a pre-printed option, which at least acknowledges that patients may be the intended recipient, but the form's structure, legal language, and scope options are all oriented toward the general authorization use case.

Patients who received both medical and behavioral health services at this facility would need to complete **two separate forms** — a meaningful friction point not faced by those seeking release to a single third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped web search located the patient forms page at a logical URL path (`/what_you_can_do/patient-resources/patient-forms/english.html`). Both forms were publicly linked, downloadable without authentication, and no bot-blocking or CAPTCHA was encountered. The download URLs are GUID-based and not human-readable, but this is a minor cosmetic issue.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form for patient self-access is form-2 (Medical and/or Dental), as it covers the broadest category of records most patients would seek. Key observations:

- **Fillability:** Despite metadata reporting 43 field annotations, the form is functionally a flat PDF — not practically fillable. Patients must print and complete by hand.
- **Length:** A single page, which is commendably concise. However, this compresses a substantial amount of content into a tight layout.
- **Language:** The introductory paragraph is notably patient-friendly: "We value your privacy at Northwest Colorado Health. Legally, we cannot release your written health record to anyone (including you) without your specific consent." The tone shifts to denser legal language in the six numbered disclaimers but remains reasonably readable.
- **Layout:** Logically organized with clear sections — patient info, FROM/TO entities, record types, purpose, sensitive-information authorization, signature, and legal paragraphs. Checkbox-driven options for record types and disclosure purposes reduce writing burden.
- **Instructions:** The form provides adequate contextual guidance but lacks explicit step-by-step instructions. Critically, it provides **no submission instructions** — a patient who downloads and completes the form has no guidance on where or how to send it (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link for submission).

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection:** Both forms request the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for identity verification under HIPAA and creates a data security risk.
- **No submission method stated:** The absence of submission instructions is a significant barrier. The Privacy Officer's mailing address appears only in the revocation clause, not as a submission destination.
- **No fee disclosure:** The forms neither mention fees nor state that patient access is free, leaving cost ambiguity.
- **Legacy organization name:** The revocation section refers to "Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association," the organization's former name, which could confuse patients despite the form's 04/2020 revision date.

## Bright Spots

- **Fast processing commitment:** "Up to 48 business hours" (~6 business days) is well within HIPAA's 30-day window and more specific and faster than most organizations promise.
- **Plain-language introduction:** The opening paragraph is warm, clear, and patient-friendly — significantly better than the legalistic openings common on ROI forms.
- **Photocopy validity:** The form states that photocopies are as valid as originals, reducing barriers for patients.
- **Non-retaliation statement:** Clearly states that care and payment will not be affected by declining to sign.
- **Easy findability:** Forms are publicly accessible without login or barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Northwest Colorado Health provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find, concise, and written with an unusually patient-friendly tone. However, the organization funnels all requests through a generic authorization form with no differentiation for patient self-access, collects unnecessary SSNs, provides no submission instructions, and offers only a print-and-handwrite workflow. The split into two separate forms by record category adds friction for patients. This is a typical small independent FQHC approach — adequate but not designed with the patient's individual access rights as a first-class concern.

# Merit Health Central — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Merit Health Central is a for-profit community hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, part of Community Health Systems (CHS) operating under the Merit Health brand. The facility uses system-standardized forms for records requests and also offers an online portal alternative via Swellbox. Two PDF forms were retrieved — English (HIM-1406) and Spanish (HIM-1406S) versions of the same document — both linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page.

## Available Pathways & Primary Form

The primary form (form-1.pdf, HIM-1406) is titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** — notably not "Authorization for Release" or similar third-party-oriented language. The form allows patients to request records for themselves, a personal representative, or a third party, with "Myself" listed as the first recipient option. A Spanish translation (form-2.pdf, HIM-1406S) with identical structure and 66 fillable fields is provided alongside. The website also offers an online request process via Swellbox (swellbox.com/merit-health-jackson-wizard.html), giving patients a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Merit Health Central does not maintain separate forms for patient self-access vs. third-party release — both use cases are served by the same HIM-1406 form. However, the form is clearly designed with patient self-access as the primary use case: the title, structure, and "Myself" first-option framing all signal a patient-access orientation. The form explicitly distinguishes recipients (self, personal representative, third party) with labeled options. This is a meaningful step above the generic third-party authorization model, even though a truly separate patient access pathway does not exist.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/request-medical-records`. The page sits under "Patients & Visitors" navigation with clearly labeled English and Spanish download links. An FAQ section addresses common questions about authorization, charges, and who can request records — providing useful context before the patient downloads anything. No bot-blocking or browser fallback issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a born-digital, single-page interactive PDF with 66 fillable fields — an exceptionally high count that means virtually every input area is digitally completable. The layout follows a logical seven-section flow: patient information, facility identification, record type selection (12 checkbox categories), sensitive information disclosure (5 categories with individual opt-in checkboxes), delivery method selection, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and direct, with clear section headers framed as patient-facing questions. The one-page format is impressively concise given the coverage.

The form offers five delivery methods: paper, email (with risk acknowledgment), removable media (DVD/USB/CD-ROM with password protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media with password protection is an unusually thoughtful option. The HIPAA acknowledgment in the footer — "This Healthcare Facility recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information" — explicitly references patient rights, though it could be more prominent.

## Barriers & Concerns

No major barriers were identified. No notarization is required, there is no in-person-only submission requirement, and the form avoids consent bundling. However, three ambiguities merit attention: (1) fee disclosure is vague — "There may be charges" with no amounts, schedules, or reference to HIPAA cost-based limits; (2) the form itself does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization (no fax number, email, or mailing address on the form); and (3) a witness signature field is present without explanation of when a witness is required, which may confuse patients completing the form remotely.

## Notable Strengths

The Spanish translation is a genuine bright spot — a fully functional, equally prominent parallel form rather than an afterthought. The Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital alternative for patients who prefer not to deal with PDF workflows. The patient-first titling and structure, comprehensive delivery options, and high fillable field count collectively demonstrate above-average attention to patient access needs. The system-standardized form (revised six times since 2018) suggests ongoing maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Merit Health Central provides a well-above-average patient records request experience. The combination of a patient-focused PDF form, Spanish translation, and online Swellbox portal covers multiple access modalities. The form's digital-first design, logical layout, and comprehensive options serve patients well. Minor shortcomings — vague fee language, missing submission instructions on the form itself, witness field ambiguity — prevent a top-tier rating but do not materially impede patient access. This is a solid B-level performance.

# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, a nonprofit community hospital in Downers Grove, IL, operates under the Advocate Health system and uses system-wide forms for medical records requests. The organization distinguishes itself by maintaining a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-4, "Patient Request for Health Information") that is clearly separated from its third-party authorization form (form-5, "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information"). This separation is a best practice that most healthcare organizations do not follow.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Seven documents were retrieved, but only four are relevant to patient medical records access:

- **Form-4** (primary): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a single-page form designed specifically for patients requesting their own records, with a "Myself" checkbox, portal callout, and five delivery method options.
- **Form-5**: "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — the third-party disclosure authorization, a companion to form-4.
- **Form-6**: Spanish-language authorization form (corresponds to the third-party release, not the patient self-request form).
- **Form-7**: Step-by-step instructions for completing the authorization form, with a portal-first framing.

The remaining forms (form-1, form-2, form-3) are Employee Assistance Program releases or a legacy Advocate Medical Group form — none relevant to hospital patient access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocate Health earns high marks for pathway differentiation. Form-4 is explicitly titled "Patient Request for Health Information" and opens with a prominent callout: *"Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org."* The form's first recipient option is "☐ Myself." This is a clear, dedicated patient access pathway — patients are not forced through a generic third-party authorization workflow.

The organization also offers the LiveWell patient portal as an alternative digital pathway, referenced on both form-4 and the instructions document (form-7). This portal-first suggestion is a notable patient-centered design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Advocate Health medical records page (advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records) clearly lists both primary forms with direct PDF download links, plus the Spanish version and instructions. No bot blocking was encountered, and all PDFs downloaded successfully. The main challenge was that the system-level organization of forms means patients searching specifically for "Good Samaritan Hospital" forms may not immediately find the centralized system page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the patient self-access form, is a well-designed single-page document that fits patient demographics, 22+ record-type checkboxes (across medical records, imaging, and billing categories), delivery method options, sensitive information acknowledgment, and signature blocks into one page. The layout is logical with clear three-column organization for record types. Language is plain and accessible.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a born-digital PDF with 8 embedded fonts and clean vector graphics. Patients must print and hand-fill, a significant missed opportunity. The form also **lacks submission instructions** — there is no mailing address, fax number, or email address telling patients where to send the completed form.

Five delivery methods are offered: paper copy by mail, CD, encrypted email, patient portal, and in-person pick-up. The inclusion of encrypted email is uncommon and welcome.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form is relatively barrier-free: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person-only submission mandate. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("Fees may apply") without amounts or a fee schedule reference. No response time is stated. Form-4 does not include an explicit patient rights statement, though form-5's companion rights section covers revocation, non-conditioning, and re-disclosure.

A notable gap exists for Spanish-speaking patients: the Spanish-language form (form-6) corresponds to the third-party authorization, not the patient self-request form. Spanish-speaking patients must use a more complex disclosure authorization to request their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, via its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its dedicated patient access form and portal-first messaging. The differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release is a model for other organizations. The form's content design is solid — concise, well-organized, and comprehensive in scope options. The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a paper workflow for the form itself), missing submission instructions, and vague fee language. The patient portal provides a digital alternative that partially compensates for the PDF's limitations. Overall, this organization provides an above-average patient experience for records access, earning a **B** grade.

# Ben Taub Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ben Taub Hospital is a government-owned community hospital in Houston, TX, part of the **Harris Health System**. It uses system-level forms for medical records requests — both downloaded PDFs are branded Harris Health documents, not Ben Taub–specific materials.

## Forms & Pathways

Two forms were retrieved. **Form-1** ("Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information") is the sole relevant document for a patient seeking their own records. **Form-2** is a marketing/media authorization unrelated to patient record access. Only form-1 is assessed below.

The medical records page at harrishealth.org clearly explains the request process and offers four submission channels: **mail, fax, email, and in-person drop-off**. Contact details — including phone (346-426-0980), fax (346-426-0959), and a dedicated email (Releaseofinformation@harrishealth.org) — are printed directly on the form. A patient can fill the form digitally and submit via fax or email without visiting the facility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Harris Health uses a **single dual-purpose authorization form** for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form handles this well through conditional sections: the "Purpose of Request/Disclosure" and "Expiration" sections are explicitly marked as "only required if the individual providing this authorization form to Harris Health is someone other than the patient." This means patients can skip irrelevant sections without needing a separate form. It is not a dedicated patient access form, but it clearly accommodates patient self-access as a first-class use case.

The email delivery option is labeled "Email Address (Patients Only)," further demonstrating that patient access is specifically considered in the form's design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and it is directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or rendering issues were encountered. The PDF URL is descriptive and identifiable in search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **65 interactive form fields** — a strong digital-first design. However, the fields lack programmatic names, reducing accessibility for screen readers and auto-fill. The form covers patient identification, recipient details, facility selection (with Ben Taub specifically listed), 14+ record type checkboxes, format options (paper, CD, email), sensitive information consent, and signature blocks — all on one page.

The layout is **dense but logically organized**, flowing from patient info → recipient → records scope → format → purpose → expiration → signatures. Section headers are minimal, and the cramped single-page layout sacrifices visual clarity for compactness. Language is moderately clear, leaning toward legal/administrative phrasing, but includes a well-worded non-conditioning statement. The form was recently revised (December 2024), suggesting active document management.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization is required and no fees are mentioned. Multiple submission channels are available. One notable concern: the form includes a **witness signature line** without clarifying whether a witness is truly required or who qualifies. This could be a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.

The form's footer includes an **internal intranet URL** (apps.hchd.local) — inaccessible to patients and a document-control oversight. The fillable fields lack programmatic names, an accessibility deficiency.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery explicitly for patients** — the "Patients Only" label on the email option is a meaningful patient-access accommodation
- **Conditional sections** that let patients skip third-party–only fields
- **Granular record type selection** with 14+ categories and proper psychotherapy notes separation
- **Multiple submission channels** with contact details printed on the form
- **Dedicated authorization withdrawal email** (AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org)

## Overall Assessment

Ben Taub Hospital, through Harris Health System, provides a **competent, accessible records request process**. The form is findable, fillable, and submittable electronically. While it uses a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, it thoughtfully accommodates patient self-access through conditional sections and patient-specific features like email delivery. The witness signature ambiguity and unnamed form fields are the primary weaknesses. Overall, this represents a solid B-level experience — functional and reasonably patient-friendly, with room for improvement in form clarity and dedicated patient access design.

# Intermountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) is a community hospital within the Intermountain Health system (formerly Intermountain Healthcare), a major nonprofit health system operating across Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming. The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones — all three retrieved documents are branded and published by Intermountain Health at the enterprise level.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all hosted on Intermountain Health's website:

1. **Form 1** (legacy, 2017): "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — a general-purpose third-party release form. Non-fillable, branded under the old "Intermountain Healthcare" name. Effectively superseded but still accessible online.
2. **Form 2** (06/2025): "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — a fillable third-party disclosure form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug explicitly reads `request-records-be-sent-to-someone-else`.
3. **Form 3** (06/2025): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a fillable patient self-access form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug reads `request-records-for-yourself`.

The most relevant form for a patient requesting their own records is **form 3**, which is the primary basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Intermountain Health stands out for explicitly separating patient self-access from third-party release into **two distinct forms**. Form 3 is titled "Patient Request for Health Information," uses question-based section headings ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?"), and defaults to "Self" as the first delivery recipient option. This is meaningfully different from the common pattern of funneling all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form. The footer acknowledges the patient's right of access under HIPAA.

One blemish: Form 2 (the third-party form) confusingly includes a "Patient Access Information" section with bullets about supervised in-person review and photo ID requirements, blurring the line between the two forms. However, the existence of a separate, cleaner patient-access form mitigates this.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF download links with no login, portal, or JavaScript rendering required. No bot blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on two domains — the legacy `intermountainhealthcare.org` and the current `prod.intermountainhealth.org` — which creates minor confusion but did not impede retrieval. The URL paths are descriptive and logical.

## Form Document Quality (Form 3)

Form 3 is a single-page, fully fillable PDF with 48 interactive fields, Print/Clear buttons, and a clean numbered 7-section layout. The language is plain and direct — section headings are phrased as questions, and the instruction "Please fill out all sections to avoid delay" is practical. Record types are covered by 12 checkboxes spanning clinical, imaging, billing, and substance use categories. Delivery options include paper mail, in-person pickup, and electronic (email, USB, CD, portal, other) with a free-text specification field. At ~2,030 characters of text, the form is admirably concise with no dense legal boilerplate.

Submission methods include email, fax, and mail — organized by state (UT/ID routes to Murray, CO/NV/MT/WY routes to Broomfield). Email submission is a genuine accessibility feature enabling fully digital completion and submission.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. Multiple remote submission options (email, fax, mail) are available — no in-person-only restriction. Fee language is vague: "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records" without specifying amounts, which could deter patients. The UT/ID email routes to R1 RCM (`MedRecReq@r1rcm.com`), a third-party vendor, without explanation on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-access form** separate from third-party authorization — uncommon and patient-centered
- **48 fillable fields** on a single page with Print/Clear buttons — excellent digital-first design
- **Question-based section headings** make the form feel conversational rather than bureaucratic
- **Email submission accepted** — a fully digital pathway from completion to submission
- **Electronic delivery explicitly offered** including email, USB, CD, portal, and "other"
- **Multilingual interpretation notices** on the legacy form (Chinese Traditional and Spanish)

## Overall Assessment

Intermountain Health provides one of the stronger patient access experiences in this study. The deliberate separation of patient self-access from third-party release, combined with a well-designed fillable form and multiple electronic submission channels, demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness. The form's plain language, logical structure, and concise single-page format make it accessible without assistance. Minor weaknesses — vague fee disclosure, undisclosed vendor routing, and a confusing legacy form still online — prevent a top-tier score but do not materially impede patient access.

# Ascension St. Vincent's East — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension St. Vincent's East is a community hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the Ascension health system that has recently partnered with or been rebranded under UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). This branding transition is the defining feature of the patient experience: two forms exist on two different websites under two different organizational names, and a patient searching under the facility's commonly known name may land on the wrong (legacy) form.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF authorization forms were found:

- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An Ascension St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization To Disclose Protected Health Information" revised February 2022, hosted on `healthcare.ascension.org` in a URL path containing the word "legacy." This 2.8 MB, 2-page form is a general-purpose ROI authorization with no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. It collects Social Security Number, lists notarized signature among identity verification options, and requires a witness signature — all potential barriers. On the positive side, it explicitly cites CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access).

- **form-2.pdf** (current): A UAB St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records" dated February 2026, hosted on `uabstvincents.org`. This is the current, most relevant form. At 143 KB and 2 pages, it is a cleaner, digital-origin document. It explicitly lists "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department" as a selectable location and includes a checkbox for "me for my personal use" — a meaningful distinction from forms that only contemplate third-party release.

The best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-2, which accommodates patient self-access as a first-class option alongside third-party authorization.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Form-2 does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release via a checkbox ("me for my personal use" vs. "the party indicated below"). This is a genuine improvement over many ROI forms and over this facility's own predecessor form. However, form-2 remains a generic authorization form — not a dedicated patient access request form. The same form, same legal language, and same process apply whether the patient wants their own records or is authorizing release to an insurer or attorney. A patient must navigate legal language about re-disclosure, initial two dense paragraphs about revocation and non-conditioning, and understand which fields apply to their scenario.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form required moderate effort. Initial searches for "Ascension St. Vincent's East" yielded system-wide Ascension forms from other states. An Alabama-specific search found the legacy form-1 on the Ascension domain. Only a separate search for "UAB St. Vincent's" uncovered the current form-2 on the UAB domain. A patient who knows this facility by its Ascension name would likely find only the outdated 2022 form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed — both PDFs downloaded directly.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a digital-origin PDF with a text layer, reasonable file size, and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all entries must be handwritten after printing. The form uses horizontal rules to separate sections and offers a well-designed tiered record selection (Key Clinical Notes bundle, Entire Medical Record, or specific report types). The "Key Clinical Notes" option — pre-defined as discharge summary, operative reports, labs, radiology, and ED documentation — is a genuine usability bright spot that helps patients who don't know medical terminology.

The opening paragraph front-loads dense legal language before the patient even fills in their name. The form contains a contradictory treatment of sensitive records: the opening paragraph states the request "includes" psychiatric and substance use information, while a later checkbox asks whether to include it. The submission instructions are indirect — rather than printing a mailing address, the form directs patients to visit a website.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-2 removes several barriers present in the legacy form: no Social Security Number field, no notarization option, no witness requirement. Non-conditioning and revocation rights are clearly stated (with initialing required). However, the form provides no fee disclosure whatsoever — patients have no idea what records will cost. The HIPAA Right of Access citation (CFR 164.524) present in form-1 was dropped in form-2, a notable regression. Submission appears limited to physical mail; no fax number or electronic submission option for the completed form is stated.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension St. Vincent's East earns credit for a reasonably well-designed authorization form that explicitly accommodates patient self-access with a personal-use checkbox and offers tiered record selection. However, the experience is undermined by the branding transition that makes the current form hard to find, zero fillable fields requiring a fully paper workflow, apparent mail-only form submission, and absent fee disclosure. The result is a facility that has the right instincts on patient-centeredness but falls short on digital accessibility and transparency.
