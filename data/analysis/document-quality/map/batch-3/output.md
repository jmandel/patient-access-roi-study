# Batch 3: Document Quality Deep Dive

## Batch Overview

This batch covers 64 organizations spanning all facility types and regions: teaching hospitals (Northwestern Memorial, Vanderbilt, OSU Wexner, Penn Medicine), community hospitals (Broward Health, Grady Memorial, Bayshore), critical access hospitals (Tioga, Cordova, Fallon Medical, Wayne County), FQHCs (Cherokee Health Systems, Philadelphia FIGHT, Sea Mar, NorthLakes), and physician practices (OrthoCarolina, ENT & Allergy, Western Washington Medical Group, Mankato Clinic).

## Fillability Breakdown

Of 64 organizations, **15 (23%)** have fillable/interactive PDF primary forms: Northwestern Memorial (79 fields), Providence St. Vincent (72 fields), Penn Medicine (70 fields), Merit Health Central (66 fields), Saratoga Hospital (65 fields), Ben Taub Hospital (65 fields), Sturdy Memorial (59 fields), MountainView/HCA (52 fields), Intermountain Medical Center (48 fields), Providence Sacred Heart (45 fields), Western Washington Medical Group (39 fields), Montefiore Nyack (39 fields), DHR Health (37 fields, English only), Community Health Centers of Burlington (36 fields), and Addabbo/OCA Form 960 (25 fields).

Approximately **7–8 organizations (11–13%)** have primary forms that are **image-only scans** with no text layer: Troy Regional Medical Center, Tioga Medical Center, Colquitt Regional, JPS Health Network, and Broward Health's English form. Vanderbilt's PDF forms are also image-only scans, and OSU Wexner's form-1 and Lincoln Hospital's clinics form lack text layers.

The remaining **~41 organizations (64%)** have **flat, digitally-authored PDFs** — born-digital with text layers but zero fillable fields. This is the dominant category: forms that *could* easily be interactive but were never configured as such. Two organizations (Fallon Medical Complex, ENT & Allergy Associates) distribute forms as Word .doc files rather than PDFs.

## Page Counts and Field Counts

Page counts range from **1 to 3 pages**. The majority are single-page forms (~35 orgs). Two-page forms are common (~25 orgs). Only three organizations reach 3 pages: Montefiore Nyack, Baptist Health Lexington (including a tips page), and Providence St. Vincent.

Estimated field counts range from **12** (Cottage Hospital, Philadelphia FIGHT, Aurora Medical Center Grafton) to **79** (Northwestern Memorial). Fillable forms average ~53 fields; flat forms average ~18. The median across all organizations is approximately 18–20 fields.

## Digital-First vs. Scanned Paper

Roughly **80–85%** of forms are digitally authored (born-digital with text layers). The image-only scans cluster at smaller or government-owned facilities: Troy Regional (government, South), Tioga (independent CAH, West), Colquitt Regional (government, South), JPS (government, South). The notable exception is **Broward Health**, a regional government system whose English-language primary form is a 200 DPI grayscale scan from 2014 while its Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese translations are digital — the primary language version is the worst-quality artifact. **Vanderbilt**, a major teaching hospital, also uses image-only scans for its PDF forms despite offering a Swellbox digital portal.

## Layout, Typography, and Visual Design

Most forms follow a logical top-to-bottom flow (demographics → record types → recipient → purpose → legal → signature). Single-page forms often sacrifice readability for compactness, resulting in cramped layouts with small fonts. Good Samaritan Medical Center (West Palm Beach) exposes raw mail-merge placeholders (`«PatientNumber»`, `«PatientName»`) — unprofessional artifacts visible to patients. OrthoCarolina has a known layout defect where authorization expiration text overlaps delivery checkboxes.

**Best visual design**: Merit Health Central (clean single-page fillable with clear seven-section flow), Intermountain Medical Center (question-based headers like "What records do you want?"), and Western Washington Medical Group (143 KB single-page fillable with embedded branding).

**Worst visual design**: Troy Regional (image-only scan on defunct website, grade D), ENT & Allergy Associates (17-year-old Word document with no visual hierarchy), and Springhill Medical Center (references "UB-92" — replaced in 2007).

## Instructions

Roughly **25–30 organizations (~40–47%)** include some form of instructions. These range from inline guidance on the form itself to dedicated companion documents. Standout examples: **Cherokee Health Systems/River Valley Health** provides color-coded annotated instructional guides in both English and Spanish — a genuinely exceptional approach. **OSU Wexner** includes a dedicated instructions page with seven numbered items mapped to form sections. **CentraCare** and **Mankato Clinic** offer separate instruction sheets with section-by-section guidance. Baptist Health Lexington includes a "Tips" page with practical guidance and a 15-day turnaround goal.

## Multilingual Support

**21 organizations (~33%)** offer some multilingual support, almost exclusively English-Spanish. **Broward Health** is the standout with four languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese), reflecting South Florida demographics. Several organizations offer Spanish only for secondary forms (Arizona Community Physicians offers Spanish for the minor access form only; Advocate Good Samaritan's Spanish form covers third-party release but not the patient access form). Translation quality varies: DHR Health's Spanish version is an image-only scan; Desert Regional's Spanish form has nine typographical errors and omits the delivery method section; Bon Secours' Spanish form lags three years behind the English version.

## Notable Examples

**Exceptionally good craftsmanship**: Northwestern Memorial's 79-field fillable bilingual form with parenthetical record-type explanations; Providence Sacred Heart's dedicated patient access form with 45 fillable fields and five delivery formats; Merit Health Central's patient-first design with 66 fillable fields in both English and Spanish; Cherokee Health Systems' bilingual instructional companion guides.

**Exceptionally poor craftsmanship**: Troy Regional Medical Center (image-only scan from 2015 on a defunct legacy website, grade D, no bright spots identified); ENT & Allergy Associates (17-year-old orphaned Word document with no submission instructions, grade D); Broward Health's English form being an image-only scan while its translations are digital; NorthLakes Community Clinic regressing from a 54-field fillable form to a non-fillable replacement.
