# Emory University Hospital — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Emory University Hospital, part of the Emory Healthcare system, offers four documents on its medical records page: a current English ROI authorization form (form-1, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), a legacy 4-page ROI package (form-2, ~September 2022), a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), and a Request for Amendment form (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting records is form-1, the current English authorization. Emory also provides a Swellbox/Datavant online records request wizard as an alternative digital pathway.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Emory does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release authorization. The primary form is a generic "Authorization for the Release of Protected Health Information" used for all release scenarios — patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties all use the same document. However, the form does include "At my request" as a named purpose option, and its delivery methods include MyChart and EHI Export, signaling awareness that patients are a key audience. A patient requesting their own records must fill themselves in as the recipient, navigating a form framework designed around the third-party release paradigm. The Swellbox portal offers a somewhat more guided digital alternative, but the overall process does not clearly distinguish HIPAA Right of Access requests from general authorization-based releases.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A targeted web search for Emory Healthcare medical records forms surfaced the PDF URL directly, and the medical records page at `emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records` is well-organized with clear links to all relevant documents — English and Spanish authorization forms, fee sheets, e-delivery instructions, amendment form, and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed. The descriptive filename convention (`english-authorization-form-fillable-revised-11-2025.pdf`) is a small but meaningful usability detail. One minor issue: the URL path includes a `/wr/` segment (likely referencing the Warner Robins facility), which could confuse patients at other Emory locations.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely fillable 2-page PDF with approximately 100 interactive fields (checkboxes and text inputs), though the PDF's AES-256 encryption caused metadata tools to report zero fillable fields. The form is organized into numbered sections covering facility selection (18+ Emory Healthcare locations), recipient and delivery information, record type specification (17+ granular checkboxes with date fields), and purpose. The layout is clean and logical. Language is a mix of clear structural labels and moderately dense legal text on page 2 (revocation rights, re-disclosure warnings, sensitive information waiver). The form is not tagged for screen reader accessibility.

A notable strength is the range of delivery options: paper, CD, USB drive, MyChart, mail, pick-up, e-delivery website, email, and — remarkably — **EHI Export**, a forward-thinking option that very few organizations surface on their authorization forms. The Spanish-language version (form-3) mirrors the English structure, though it has character encoding issues (accented characters rendering as digits) and incomplete translation of institutional terms.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. No in-person submission requirement exists — patients can fax or use the Swellbox portal. The primary form does not disclose fees directly; a separate fee sheet ($6.50 flat for electronic delivery, $0.07/page for paper) is available on the medical records page. The legacy form-2 required a separate fee acknowledgment signature, but the current form-1 does not. The form does include a blanket waiver for sensitive information (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health) that does not allow patients to opt out of releasing specific sensitive categories — a common but patient-unfriendly approach.

## Overall Assessment

Emory Healthcare provides a competent, well-organized records request process with several standout features — particularly the EHI Export delivery option, the Spanish-language form, and the Swellbox online portal. The forms are easy to find, fillable, and recently updated. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must use the same generic authorization form as third-party requesters, without clear guidance on how to request their own records specifically. The form accommodates patient requests but was not designed around them as a first-class use case. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and well-maintained, but not yet patient-centered in its design philosophy.

# Fenway Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fenway Health, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Boston, MA, provides a cohesive three-document records-release package: an English ROI authorization form (form-1), a companion FAQ guide (form-2), and a Spanish translation of the ROI form (form-3). The forms are easy to find, submission channels are plentiful, and the organization demonstrates genuine care for its patient population through thoughtful design choices — but it does not offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway, instead routing all records requests through a generic third-party authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

The primary form is titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" and is structured around a FROM/TO model: "I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM: Sender/Facility's name... TO: Recipient/Facility's name." This framing is designed for provider-to-provider transfers — a patient wanting their own records must write their personal name and address into the "Recipient/Facility's name" field, which is unintuitive. There is no checkbox for "send records to me" and no separate patient access form. The organization does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization.

Fenway Health also offers MyChart patient portal access, which provides a separate digital pathway, but the downloadable form itself is firmly a generic authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Fenway Health's forms was straightforward — a simple web search immediately returned the PDF URL and the dedicated medical records page at fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was needed. The organization maintains a clean, dedicated medical records landing page with clear submission instructions. This is a best-case retrieval scenario.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a clean text layer and 7 fonts — clearly designed with care in a layout tool. However, it contains zero fillable fields, which is a significant missed opportunity. Despite being digitally created, patients must print, hand-fill, and then scan or fax the form. The layout follows a logical 7-section flow (patient info → sender → recipient → reason → record type → sensitive info → signature) and fits on one page, though the density is notable. The legal notice in Section 7 is a single 130-word block mixing authorization scope, revocation rights, reproductive health protections, and substance abuse protections — challenging to parse.

Section 6 (Sensitive Information) stands out: it requires individual patient initials for 10 categories of sensitive health information, including abortion care, gender-affirming care, HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, and substance use treatment. This granularity gives patients unusually fine-grained control over disclosure.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fenway Health imposes no unreasonable barriers. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person mandate, and no fees mentioned. Submission channels include mail, fax, email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org), and MyChart portal — four pathways, all adequate for remote submission. The form clearly states revocation rights and a one-year authorization validity period. Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (in the FAQ sheet), well within HIPAA's 30-day requirement. The sensitive information initials requirement, while thorough, could function as a processing delay trigger if patients skip it — the bold warning "COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING" has a somewhat coercive tone.

## Notable Strengths

Fenway Health's standout feature is the companion FAQ sheet (form-2) — a 3-page plain-language guide that walks patients through every section of the ROI form, defining terms like "bi-directional" and "abstract" that would otherwise be opaque. Very few healthcare organizations create separate instructional documents for their ROI forms. The Spanish-language form (form-3) demonstrates commitment to language access, though no Spanish FAQ exists. The inclusion of Massachusetts-specific shield-law language protecting reproductive health and gender-affirming care records reflects both legal compliance and organizational mission. The "Name used (if different)" field thoughtfully accommodates patients whose current name differs from their legal name.

## Weaknesses

The most significant weakness is the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway. The FROM/TO structure is designed for third-party release and does not clearly serve a patient requesting their own records. The lack of fillable fields on a born-digital PDF is a technical oversight that forces an unnecessary print-handwrite-scan workflow. The Spanish form's contact block reverts to English ("Mail/Fax to:", "Attn: Medical Records Dept"), undermining the translation effort.

## Overall Assessment

Fenway Health earns a solid B. The organization demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its FAQ guide, multilingual forms, and sensitive information protections, but falls short on the two key assessment dimensions: it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, and its form is not digitally fillable despite being born-digital. A patient can successfully request their records through this process, but the form was not designed with that use case as a first-class concern.

# Phelps Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, NY is a community hospital within the Northwell Health system. It uses Northwell's system-wide forms for medical records requests, hosted at the parent system's medical records page (northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records). Six documents were retrieved in total: two core forms (patient access and third-party authorization), a Spanish bilingual authorization form, two companion instruction guides, and a duplicate non-fillable version of the authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

Northwell Health stands out by clearly differentiating patient self-access from third-party release. The medical records page has two distinct sections: "Request for Access to Health Information" (for patients requesting their own records) and "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (for directing records to third parties). The patient access form (form-2) is explicitly titled "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative" and opens by citing HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524) — framing the request as an exercise of patient rights rather than a permission grant. A "To me" checkbox in Section 2 makes the self-access pathway concrete. This separation is a genuine best practice that many health systems fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches for "Phelps Hospital" combined with medical records terms immediately surfaced the Northwell Health medical records page. The page is well-organized with descriptive URLs and clear section headings. The main friction is that Phelps Hospital's own sub-site (phelps.northwell.edu) does not host forms directly — patients must navigate to the parent system's website, which is a minor extra step but the connection is clear from the Northwell branding.

## Form Document Quality

The primary patient access form (form-2) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with 28 fillable interactive fields. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence: patient demographics, facility releasing records, recipient (with "To me" option), delivery manner and format, requested health information scope, substance use/HIV section, and signature. The delivery options grid is particularly well-designed, pairing delivery manner (mail, pickup, email, fax) with format (paper, USB, CD, secure/unsecure email) in a structured table. Scope options include medical record abstract, date-range records, entire record, lab results, radiology, itemized bills, and a free-text "Other" field — giving patients granular control.

The language is reasonably plain, with parenthetical glosses like "(From Who)" and "(To Who)" alongside formal labels. The substance use disorder section (Section 5) is denser legal text, but it's conditionally required — only for patients requesting those specific record types. A companion instruction document (form-6) provides step-by-step annotated examples with sample data, significantly lowering the completion barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization is required. The witness signature line is present but not explicitly mandatory. No fees are mentioned. No in-person submission is required. These are all positives.

The most significant gap is the absence of submission instructions on the form itself — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link. A patient who fills out the form has no guidance on where to send it. Fax submission is presumably available as an industry standard for Northwell facilities, but the patient must find this information independently.

A notable equity concern: the website has a bug where both the "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)" links point to the same URL, which contains only the Spanish authorization (third-party) form. There is no Spanish-language version of the patient access form despite the website appearing to offer one. This effectively denies Spanish-speaking patients access to the correct form for exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

## Notable Strengths

The strongest features of Northwell's approach for Phelps Hospital patients are: (1) the dedicated patient access form with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation, (2) companion instruction documents for both forms with annotated visual examples, (3) rich delivery format options including secure email, USB, CD, and fax, (4) fully fillable interactive PDFs for digital completion, and (5) plain-language accessibility touches throughout. The dual-form architecture — with separate patient access and third-party release pathways — represents a structural investment in patient-centered design.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Hospital, through its parent Northwell Health system, provides an above-average patient records request experience. The dedicated patient access pathway — with its explicit HIPAA § 164.524 framing, separate form architecture, and companion instruction materials — represents a genuinely patient-centered design that earns top marks for patient-centeredness. The fillable digital forms and comprehensive delivery options round out a strong offering. The main weaknesses — missing submission instructions on the form and the broken Spanish form links — are addressable defects rather than structural problems. This is a solid B-grade experience overall (4.25/5.0): clearly competent and patient-aware, with room for improvement in closing operational gaps.

# Mayers Memorial Hospital District — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were found for Mayers Memorial Hospital District, a government-owned critical access hospital in Fall River Mills, California:

1. **form-2.pdf** — A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" branded with the hospital's name, adapted from the California Hospital Association template (CHA 16-1, March 2013). This is hosted directly on the hospital website but critically mislabeled as "Disclosure of Privacy Practices" in the site navigation. It is the hospital's primary ROI authorization form (form number MMH 470).

2. **form-1.pdf** — A 1-page generic, unbranded "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It was found only through web search and is not linked from any page on the hospital website.

For a patient requesting their own records, **form-2.pdf is the most relevant** — it is the branded hospital form, includes a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose, and contains a substantive "My Rights" section. However, both forms are fundamentally structured as third-party release authorizations.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mayers Memorial does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms require patients to fill in a recipient's name and address, meaning a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own contact information as the "recipient." Form-2 partially acknowledges patient self-access through a "Patient request" checkbox, but the workflow remains identical to a third-party release. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding a usable form was **difficult**. The hospital's Medical Records page provides only department hours and a phone number — no downloadable form, no request instructions. The branded form (form-2) is linked from the Patients & Visitors page under the misleading label "Disclosure of Privacy Practices," a title that describes an entirely different type of document. A patient looking for a records release form would likely skip this link. The generic form-1 is only discoverable through external web search leading to a third-party CDN URL.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-2** (the primary form) is an **image-only scan** with no text layer and no fillable fields. It cannot be searched, copied from, or read by screen readers — a significant accessibility failure. Despite the poor digital format, its content is reasonably well-structured: clear section headers, checkboxes for record scope (all records vs. specific types), granular sensitive-information checkboxes (mental health, HIV, substance abuse) each requiring initials, and a "My Rights" section written in plain first-person language. Estimated field count is approximately 15 fields across 2 pages.

**Form-1** has a text layer (digitally created) but also lacks fillable fields and is far less complete — no checkboxes, no scope options, no rights statement, and no HIPAA-required authorization elements (expiration, revocation).

Neither form provides any submission instructions — no fax number, mailing address, email, or portal link. A patient who completes the form has no documented path to submit it without calling the hospital.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions on either form**: The most critical barrier — patients cannot determine how to return a completed form.
- **Image-only scan** (form-2): Completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.
- **Intimidating opening language** (form-2): "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — potentially chilling for patients who lack details like their MRN.
- **Mislabeled web link**: The form is hidden behind an incorrect label, making it effectively unfindable through normal navigation.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form addresses whether fees will be charged.

## Bright Spots

- The "My Rights" section on form-2 is genuinely well-written in plain first-person language, clearly stating patients' rights to refuse, inspect records, and revoke authorization.
- Sensitive information handling is properly separated with individual checkboxes and initial lines, compliant with California law and 42 CFR Part 2.
- Use of the CHA template ensures baseline legal compliance with California health privacy requirements.

## Overall Assessment

Mayers Memorial provides a below-average patient experience for records access. While the branded form has decent content design rooted in its CHA template, the combination of extremely poor findability, an image-only scan format, absent submission instructions, and no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release creates a frustrating and largely inaccessible process. A patient attempting to request their own records online would struggle at every step — finding the form, reading it with assistive technology, understanding how to complete it for self-access, and figuring out where to submit it.

# Canton-Potsdam Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Canton-Potsdam Hospital (CPH) is a community hospital in Potsdam, NY, operated as part of St. Lawrence Health System (SLH), which was acquired by Rochester Regional Health (RRH). Three documents were retrieved — all from the Wayback Machine, as no forms remain on any live website. The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, a blank New York State OCA Official Form No. 960 ("Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA"). The other two documents are a COVID-specific pre-filled version of the same form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Canton-Potsdam Hospital does **not** offer a differentiated pathway for patient self-access. The only authorization form the organization ever published online was the generic NY State OCA-960, which is designed for third-party release of information — not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. A patient requesting their own records would use the same form as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer, needing to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission tool.

Critically, the parent system's Swellbox/Datavant online records request tool **explicitly excludes** St. Lawrence Health facilities, stating: "St. Lawrence Health is not currently available through this application, for information on requesting these records call (315) 769-4386." This leaves phone as the only visible pathway for patients today.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any form for this organization was extremely difficult. The original SLH website (stlawrencehealthsystem.org) now redirects to rochesterregional.org, where CPH-specific content has not been migrated. Multiple web searches returned no downloadable forms. The only successful strategy was the Wayback Machine CDX API, which identified archived PDFs from the defunct SLH domain. A typical patient would have no realistic way to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2.pdf, blank OCA-960) is a digitally produced PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. Its text layer is severely garbled due to font encoding issues, rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers, search, or copy-paste. Despite being created digitally (via PScript5.dll/Acrobat Distiller), no interactive fields were added, requiring patients to print and handwrite responses.

The form is 2 pages: page 1 is the authorization itself with 13 numbered items; page 2 provides instructions. The structure is logical and reasonably organized, covering patient identification, record scope, recipients, purpose, expiration, and signature. However, the language is formal and legalistic, and the form is not pre-populated with any CPH or SLH contact information — patients must know and fill in the correct provider name and HIM department address themselves.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form includes appropriate compliance elements: explicit voluntariness statement, non-conditioning language, right to revoke in writing, and separate initialing for sensitive categories (HIV, substance abuse, mental health) per NY State law. However, the form header includes a Social Security Number field, which creates unnecessary identity theft risk and is not required by HIPAA. No fees are mentioned on the authorization form itself, though the NPP (form-3) does include HIPAA-compliant fee language limiting electronic copy costs to direct labor.

The form does not specify submission methods, delivery format options, or response timelines. No electronic delivery options are mentioned.

## Notable Strengths

- Uses the standardized NY State OCA-960, ensuring baseline legal compliance
- NPP clearly articulates electronic access rights and EHR-based record availability
- Patient-controlled authorization expiration (by date or event)
- Appropriate sensitive-information opt-in with separate initialing requirements

## Notable Weaknesses

- No ROI form available on any live website; patients must call to initiate requests
- Parent system's online records tool explicitly excludes this facility
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party authorization
- Form has zero fillable fields and a garbled, inaccessible text layer
- SSN field on authorization form creates unnecessary risk
- Organization appears stuck in a transitional state between SLH and RRH infrastructure

## Overall Assessment

Canton-Potsdam Hospital presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in this study. The combination of unfindable forms, a phone-only current pathway, no dedicated patient access process, and technically deficient documents creates substantial barriers for patients seeking their own records. The organizational transition from St. Lawrence Health to Rochester Regional Health has left patients in a gap — excluded from the parent system's digital tools but with no local alternative. A patient today would need to call, navigate an uncertain process, and likely complete a paper form designed for third-party release rather than individual access.

# Bath Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Bath Community Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Hot Springs, Virginia. The organization offers a single ROI form for medical records requests, hosted on its website. No patient portal, online request wizard, or alternative digital pathway was identified.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a one-page "Request of Information" PDF (`form-1.pdf`) branded under **Bath Community Physicians Group** rather than Bath Community Hospital itself. This branding mismatch is common among small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative infrastructure. The form is hosted on the hospital's website at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf` and linked from the Patient Resources → Forms page.

The form is a generic release-of-information authorization — it uses a "Send / Receive" and "To / From" structure designed primarily for inter-provider record transfers, not for patient self-access. A patient wanting their own records would need to adapt the form by marking "Send" and writing in their own name and address as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA individual access rights, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. A targeted web search surfaced the PDF directly, and the hospital's website links to it from a clearly labeled "Medical Records Request" section under Patient Resources. The URL path is descriptive. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. For a small critical access hospital, the form is reasonably discoverable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **scanned paper document** with an OCR text layer — not a digitally-created or fillable PDF. Despite metadata suggesting 21 fillable fields, the field names are empty and the form functions as a flat scan that must be printed and completed by hand. The OCR layer contains numerous errors ("ERNOTE," "LABffEST RESULTS," "IMAGINE REPORTS," "DISHCHARGE SUMMARY"), rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers and text-based search tools.

At one page with approximately 15 patient-completed fields, the form is appropriately brief. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → authorization direction → destination → reason → record type selection → signature block. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records consent paragraph is somewhat dense. No instructions are provided for how to complete or submit the form.

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access requests. This creates a real barrier — a patient must find someone to witness their signature before submitting. The form also requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, raising privacy concerns for a document that may be faxed.

No fees are mentioned. No response time commitment is stated. Submission instructions are absent; the header includes a fax number (540-962-7881), suggesting fax is an available submission method, but this is not explicitly stated. No in-person-only requirement is stated, so fax submission appears available.

## Notable Strengths

The form correctly separates consent for alcohol/drug abuse and psychiatric records into a dedicated checkbox — proper 42 CFR Part 2 practice that many organizations neglect. It also includes a checkbox for patients to request a copy of their signed authorization, a HIPAA requirement that many forms omit.

## Overall Assessment

Bath Community Hospital provides a minimally functional pathway for patients to request their records, but the experience is not patient-centered. The form was designed for provider-to-provider transfers and requires patients to adapt it for self-access. The scanned-image quality, OCR errors, witness requirement, and lack of submission instructions all create friction. While the form is findable and brief, it reflects an older, paper-first approach to health information management typical of small independent facilities. A patient could complete the process, but would receive little guidance and face an unnecessary witness barrier along the way.

# Proliance Surgeons — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Proliance Surgeons is a large, independent, for-profit physician practice group based in Seattle, WA, comprising multiple member practices (ProOrtho, Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, Northwest Physicians Specialists/MRI, Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons, and others). Four documents were retrieved: two nearly identical outgoing ROI authorization forms (form-2 from the main site, form-4 from ProOrtho), an image-only scan of a similar form (form-1 from NPS/MRI), and an incoming records transfer form (form-3 from Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons). The main medical records page also references Datavant as an online ROI partner, though the portal was not evaluated directly.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Proliance Surgeons does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. All outgoing ROI forms (form-1, form-2, form-4) use the same generic HIPAA authorization template ("Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information"), which is designed for third-party disclosure under § 164.508. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address as the "recipient" — an awkward workflow that conflates patient access rights (§ 164.524) with third-party authorization. The form does include an "at my request" reason checkbox, but the structure assumes disclosure to an external party. There is no mention of HIPAA Right of Access, no format/delivery preference field, and no reference to timelines or fee limitations specific to individual access.

The mention of Datavant on the medical records page suggests an online portal option exists, which would provide a more streamlined pathway, but the PDF forms themselves are the only downloadable option found.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A basic web search immediately surfaced multiple PDFs, and the main Proliance medical records page (proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links directly to the primary form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The main challenge is fragmentation: different member practices host their own versions of the same template, and a patient arriving at a subsidiary site (npsmri.com, proortho.com) may find a different version than the canonical one on the main site, with no cross-referencing between versions.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf** (ProOrtho), which is textually identical to form-2 but was noted to have interactive checkboxes (though metadata reports 0 AcroForm fields, suggesting non-standard implementation). Both are single-page, cleanly structured documents with two clear sections: "I. My Authorization" and "II. My Rights." The language is relatively plain, written in first person ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), and the layout is logical. Scope options are well-granulated (all records, condition-specific, date-specific, plus sensitive categories requiring explicit opt-in per Washington State law). However, neither form has true fillable text fields — patients must print and handwrite all entries. Form-2 includes a practice-specific fax number (425.820.8975) for submission; form-4 lacks any submission instructions entirely.

Form-1 is an image-only scan at 150 DPI with no text layer — completely inaccessible to screen readers and unsearchable. It represents the worst-case scenario a patient might encounter if they land on the NPS/MRI subsidiary site.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness requirement** — a positive.
- **No fees disclosed** — neutral; avoids deterrence but leaves patients uninformed.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax submission is available via form-2.
- **No electronic signature option** — requires printing and wet signature.
- **No response time stated** — patients have no expectation for turnaround.
- **Practice-specific contact info** baked into one form variant, creating confusion for patients at other Proliance locations.

## Notable Strengths

- **Concise one-page format** that covers all essential authorization elements without clutter.
- **Sensitive information categories** properly separated with individual opt-in checkboxes (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), compliant with Washington State RCW 70.02.
- **First-person rights language** in the "My Rights" section, which is more patient-friendly than typical third-person legal boilerplate.
- **Clear revocation instructions** with two specific methods (revocation form or letter).
- **Datavant portal mentioned** on the medical records page as an online alternative.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **Generic authorization form conflated with patient access** — no dedicated Right of Access pathway.
- **No fillable text fields** — print-and-handwrite workflow despite being a digitally-created document.
- **Fragmentation across subsidiaries** — multiple versions with inconsistent quality and no cross-referencing.
- **Form-1 is an image-only scan** — a digital accessibility failure.
- **Form-3 cites wrong state law** (California CMIA instead of Washington RCW 70.02) and wrong HIPAA year (2003 vs. 1996).

## Overall Assessment

Proliance Surgeons provides a readily findable, concise authorization form with reasonable content design and no major procedural barriers. However, the organization falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all record requests through a generic third-party authorization form with no differentiation for individual access. The print-and-handwrite workflow and subsidiary fragmentation further diminish the experience. The mention of Datavant as an online option is promising but not reflected in the downloadable forms themselves. Overall grade: **C** — adequate but not designed around patient self-access.

# Southwell (Tift Regional Health System) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Southwell's medical release page at `mysouthwell.com/medical-release/` presents four downloadable documents. Two are parallel ROI authorization forms — one for the hospital system (form-1, "TRHS Authorization to Release/Obtain PHI," 2 pages) and one for the ambulatory clinics (form-3, "SWA Authorization to Release Protected Health Information," 1 page). Form-2 is a newer image-only scan (July 2025, produced on a Canon copier) that appears to be a revised version of form-1 but with degraded quality and no text layer. Form-4 is a reference list of ~40 TRHS entity names and addresses, not an ROI form. The organization also references Verisma as an online records request partner at a separate page (`mysouthwell.com/medical-record-request/`), but this pathway was not directly evaluated as part of the form download process.

The most relevant form for patient self-access at the hospital system is **form-1**, the TRHS authorization. It has a text layer, logical numbered structure, and covers the main hospital facilities. Form-3 serves the same role for ambulatory clinics.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Southwell does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All downloadable forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. They require the patient to name a recipient ("This information may be disclosed to and used by the following individual or organization") even when the patient is requesting records for personal use. "Personal Use" appears as one of six purpose checkboxes, but the form's architecture assumes a third-party release workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no simplified self-access flow. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, figuring out that they should write their own name in the "recipient" field.

The split between TRHS hospital forms and SWA ambulatory forms further fragments the experience. A patient who received care at both a hospital and a specialty clinic would need to complete two separate authorization forms for two different legal entities, with no clear guidance about which form covers which facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was relatively straightforward. The medical release page is accessible via the website's navigation (Home → Patient & Visitors → Medical Release), and web searches surfaced the page without difficulty. No bot blocking or login requirements were encountered. However, the page presents multiple forms without clear differentiation — patients must determine whether form-1, form-2, or form-3 applies to their situation, and the relationship between the overlapping TRHS forms (form-1 vs. form-2) is unclear.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 (the best available) has a text layer and logical numbered structure (8 sections covering facility selection, record types, sensitive info notice, recipient, purpose, revocation, non-conditioning, and voluntary disclosure). It offers good granularity in record type selection — 10 categories with individual date range fields, plus delivery options (Paper, CD, Electronic Delivery). However, the form has **zero fillable fields**. All checkboxes and text fields are static, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. The form does not specify how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, email address, or mailing instructions for submission appear on the form itself (the mailing address in Section 6 relates to revocation, not submission).

The language is moderately legalistic, with dense compliance-driven text in the sensitive information notice and revocation sections. The layout is functional but the second page contains only two short paragraphs and signature lines, suggesting it could be consolidated. Form-2 represents a regression — an image-only scan with no text layer, no OCR, degraded readability, and Paper pre-checked as the delivery method.

## Barriers

Two notable barriers exist. First, a **witness signature** is required on all forms — HIPAA does not require witnesses for authorization or access requests, and this creates a real obstacle for patients completing forms independently at home. Second, all forms collect the **last 4 digits of SSN**, an unnecessary data element that creates privacy risk beyond what MRN and DOB provide.

No fees are mentioned on any form. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated. The 90-day default expiration on forms 1 and 3 (extended to one year on form-2) could force resubmission if processing is slow.

## Overall Assessment

Southwell provides a minimally functional but decidedly paper-oriented records request process. The forms are findable and structurally organized, with useful features like granular record type selection and an electronic delivery option. However, the lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, the fragmented multi-form landscape, and the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway all reflect a process designed for institutional convenience rather than patient self-service. The organization appears to offer a Verisma online portal as an alternative, which could meaningfully improve the digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms remain firmly rooted in a print-and-mail paradigm.

# Synthesis: Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin

## Overview

Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (GHC-SCW) is a nonprofit, independent physician practice in Madison, WI. It publishes two distinct ROI-related PDF forms, plus a Spanish-language version of one of them, on a well-organized public forms page. Critically, GHC-SCW is one of the relatively rare organizations that offers a **dedicated patient self-access form** separate from its general third-party authorization — a meaningful structural distinction that demonstrates thoughtful process design around patient rights.

## Forms and Pathways

**Form 1** ("Authorization to Release Protected Health Information From GHC-SCW") is a 2-page general HIPAA authorization form oriented toward third-party release. It covers scenarios like transferring care, insurance, disability determinations, and legal use, with "Personal Use" available as one checkbox option. A Spanish version is also published. While usable for patient self-access, the framing, language, and workflow are designed around the third-party release use case.

**Form 2** ("Patient Request for Health Information Form") is a 1-page, fillable PDF designed specifically for patients requesting their own records. This is the primary form for patient self-access and the basis for scoring. It uses plain-English question-based section headers ("What records do you want?", "How would you like your records delivered?"), offers granular record-type checkboxes with date range scoping, and provides multiple delivery options including paper, email (encrypted by default), CD, USB, and MyChart portal delivery.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

GHC-SCW clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release by maintaining two separate forms. Form 2 is purpose-built for the individual access use case, with simpler language, fewer fields, and a patient-centered workflow. This is a best practice that most organizations do not follow — the typical approach is a single generic authorization form that patients must navigate regardless of whether they're requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. The first web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's forms page at ghcscw.com/members/forms/ is cleanly organized with a "Release of Information Forms" section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA were encountered. One minor quirk: Form 2 was listed under "Health Insurance Forms" rather than "Release of Information Forms," which could cause a patient browsing specifically for ROI forms to miss the more patient-friendly option.

## Form Document Quality

Form 2 is technically excellent: a fully fillable PDF with 49 interactive fields on a single page. The layout is clean and logically ordered (demographics → record selection → delivery method → recipient → signature). The language is accessible and avoids legalese. The form explicitly references the patient's HIPAA right of access and sets a transparent processing timeline of 5 business days.

Form 1, by contrast, has zero fillable fields despite being digitally authored, and explicitly prohibits electronic signatures — creating a print-sign-scan workflow that undermines electronic submission. However, since Form 2 is the primary patient access pathway and is fully fillable, the organization's overall technical accessibility is strong.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: Form 2 states "There may be charges associated with processing a request" without specifying amounts. The notes mention CIOX Health as the ROI vendor and note that "CIOX requires payment for medical records." Fee vagueness leaves patients unable to anticipate costs, and the CIOX involvement raises questions about whether fees are limited to HIPAA's cost-based standard for patient access.

**Submission instructions gap**: Form 2 lacks any indication of where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email. Patients must refer to Form 1 or the website for submission details. Form 1 provides mail, fax (608-441-3499), email (ghcroi@ghcscw.com), and in-person drop-off as options.

**No notarization or witness required**. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a genuine best practice
- **Fully fillable PDF** with 49 interactive fields on one concise page
- **Multiple delivery formats**: paper, encrypted email, CD, USB, MyChart portal
- **Encrypted email as default** with opt-in for unencrypted — privacy by design
- **Spanish-language version** of Form 1 available
- **Plain-language, question-based headers** make the form approachable
- **Transparent processing timeline** (5 business days)

## Overall Assessment

GHC-SCW demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by maintaining a dedicated, well-designed patient access form that is technically fillable, concisely written, and offers flexible delivery options including portal-based delivery. The main weaknesses are the vague fee disclosure, the absence of submission instructions on Form 2 itself, and the use of CIOX Health as the ROI vendor (which may introduce fee concerns). Despite these gaps, the organization's approach to patient record access is meaningfully above average and reflects intentional design around patient rights.

# CrescentCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CrescentCare is an independent nonprofit FQHC in New Orleans, Louisiana. The organization provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms — one in English (form-1.pdf) and one in Spanish (form-2.pdf) — for patients to request release of their medical information. Both are prominently linked from the Patient Resources and Downloads page. Notably, CrescentCare also maintains a dedicated "Request your medical records" page at `/records-request-form/` with an online submission option, providing a digital-first alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Assessment

CrescentCare uses a single generic HIPAA authorization form for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form is designed with patient self-access as a first-class use case: the "Myself via" option appears first in the recipient section, before the "Or to:" third-party option. This is a meaningful design choice that signals patient access is not an afterthought. The form offers three delivery methods for self-requests — Patient Portal, Encrypted Email, and Pick Up — with two of the three being electronic.

The organization goes further by offering a separate online records request page, giving patients who prefer a fully digital workflow an alternative to printing and mailing a PDF. This dual-pathway approach (PDF form plus online portal) is commendable for an FQHC.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding CrescentCare's forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's Patient Resources page prominently lists both language versions. No bot blocking, browser fallbacks, or creative search strategies were needed. The filenames are descriptive and language-tagged (`_en.pdf`, `_es.pdf`). Retrieval difficulty: Easy.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer. It follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient Information → Recipient → Information to Be Disclosed → Special Authorization for Sensitive Records → Purpose → Expiration → Patient Rights → Signature. The language is plain and accessible throughout; the patient rights section uses clear bullet points rather than dense legalese.

The form provides meaningful granularity with six record-type checkboxes plus an "Other" option, and appropriately gates sensitive records (behavioral health, substance use, HIV/AIDS) behind separate patient initials, consistent with Louisiana law and 42 CFR Part 2.

The primary weakness is that the PDF has zero fillable form fields despite being digitally authored. Patients must print, handwrite, and return the form — a notable gap for a document distributed online. Additionally, the form lacks submission instructions: no mailing address, fax number, or email address appears on the form itself, leaving patients uncertain how to return it.

## Barriers and Compliance

CrescentCare's form imposes no unnecessary barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement. The no-conditioning statement is explicit ("my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on my signing this authorization"). Revocation rights are clearly stated, though requiring a "signed letter" is a slightly higher bar than simply accepting any written request. No fees are mentioned on the form — this neither discourages patients nor sets expectations. No response timeframe is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Providing fully translated English and Spanish forms with identical structure is especially appropriate for New Orleans' diverse patient population.
- **Electronic delivery options**: Offering Patient Portal and Encrypted Email for self-requests is progressive — many organizations only offer mail or pickup.
- **Online records request page**: The dedicated `/records-request-form/` page provides a digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF workflow.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Fitting all necessary authorization elements on one well-organized page respects patient time.
- **Self-access prioritized**: Placing the "Myself via" option before third-party release on the form signals that patient access is a primary use case.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive form fields despite digital authoring — a missed opportunity for a form designed for online distribution.
- **No submission instructions**: The form gives patients no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **No fee or timeline disclosure**: Patients have no expectations about cost or turnaround time.

## Overall Assessment

CrescentCare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an FQHC. The combination of a well-designed bilingual authorization form, explicit patient self-access options, electronic delivery methods, and a separate online records request portal places it ahead of most peers. The main gaps — a non-fillable PDF and missing submission instructions — are common across the industry and prevent an excellent rating. Overall grade: B.

# Community Health Center of Central Missouri — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Community Health Center of Central Missouri (CHCCMO), an independent nonprofit FQHC with four clinic locations across central Missouri, publishes a single general-purpose ROI form — an "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." Two versions were found: a current 2025 update (form-1) and a superseded 2023 version (form-2). Both are hosted as publicly accessible WordPress uploads on chccmo.org. There is no online portal, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no dedicated patient access form. The PDF form, submitted by fax, mail, email, or in-person pickup, is the only pathway.

## Access Pathway: No Individual Access Differentiation

CHCCMO does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party release. Both versions use a generic FROM/TO routing structure designed for provider-to-provider transfers. The 2025 form asks patients to specify "Please send my records FROM" and "Please send my records TO," with checkboxes for CHCCMO or "Other" at each end. A patient wanting their own records must navigate this structure, filling in their personal information in the TO field — a workflow clearly designed for transfers between entities, not for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). Neither form references HIPAA, the Right of Access, or patient access rights beyond a brief acknowledgment section.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **trivially easy**. A standard web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No site navigation, bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The filename (`Release-of-Records-updated-2025.pdf`) is descriptive. However, the older 2023 version remains publicly accessible at a different URL with no indication it is superseded, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The 2025 form (form-1) is the primary document and represents the organization's current offering. It is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite all entries. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → sender/receiver routing → delivery method → record types → date range → purpose → acknowledgment → signature. However, the page is densely packed, and the multi-column layout in the record type and purpose sections may fragment reading order. The acknowledgment section is a single dense paragraph of legal boilerplate rather than numbered, digestible points.

Positive document features include email as a delivery option (alongside fax, mail, and pickup), preset date range options ("Last 12 months" / "Last 24 months"), and a comprehensive list of 10 named record categories. The form is concise at one page. However, it contains a misspelled heading ("AKNOWLEDGEMENT") and inconsistent ZIP codes between the form body and footer (65101 vs. 65110).

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate. This creates a procedural barrier, particularly for patients completing the form at home. The sensitive records clause bundles all sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing) into a single all-or-nothing authorization without granular opt-in/opt-out, which may conflict with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records. The 2025 form does not mention fees, leaving the cost question ambiguous; the older 2023 version references potential copying costs. No notarization is required. Submission can be done via fax or email, so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: Extremely easy findability; concise one-page form; email as a delivery option (uncommon among ROI forms); preset date range options reduce friction; comprehensive record type selection; non-conditioning and revocation language included.

**Weaknesses**: No dedicated patient access pathway — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization form; no fillable PDF fields despite being digitally created; witness requirement adds unnecessary friction; sensitive records bundling; typos and address inconsistencies in the form; no HIPAA Right of Access language; no response time commitment in the 2025 version (the 2023 version mentions 30 days).

## Overall Assessment

CHCCMO makes its ROI form easy to find and keeps it concise, but the form itself reflects a provider-centric rather than patient-centric design philosophy. It treats all records requests — whether from patients, insurers, attorneys, or other providers — identically through a generic authorization form. The lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, and the absence of any Right of Access language mean that a patient requesting their own records faces unnecessary friction and receives no acknowledgment that this is a right, not a favor. The organization earns credit for easy findability and electronic submission options, but falls short on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and compliance hygiene.

# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Medical Center (CMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Toms River, NJ, part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also offers a Ciox/Swellbox online records request portal as the primary pathway for patients.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF documents were downloaded:

- **form-1.pdf** — A CMC-specific one-page "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility" (2017, image-only scan, no fillable fields). This is the legacy facility-level outbound release form.
- **form-2.pdf** — A one-page "Request for Release of Health Information *to* CMC" (2015/2021, image-only scan). This is an inbound records transfer form and is **not relevant** for a patient requesting their own records.
- **form-3.pdf** — The system-wide RWJBH "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (3 pages, Nov 2025, has text layer but no fillable fields). This is the most current and comprehensive form, covering all RWJBH locations. It is the best available PDF for patient self-access.

Beyond PDF forms, the medical records page prominently features a **Ciox/Swellbox online portal** for electronic records requests. Fax (732-557-2209) and email (cmcroimedicalrecords@rwjbh.org) submission options are also available.

## Patient Access Pathway

CMC does not offer a dedicated form specifically designed for patient self-access. Both the legacy CMC form (form-1) and the system-wide form (form-3) are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient access, third-party requests, insurance, legal, and continuing care. On form-3, "Personal" appears as a purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care/Treatment," "Insurance," and "Legal," but the patient must name themselves as the recipient in a field clearly designed for third-party organizations. The Swellbox online portal, however, may provide a more patient-centric experience as a purpose-built records request tool, and the organization directs patients toward it as the primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was straightforward. A direct web search for CMC medical records authorization returned the facility's medical records page immediately. The page links to the CMC-specific forms and references the online portal. The system-wide form (form-3) required a separate search at the RWJBH system level. No bot blocking or authentication barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing form-3 (the best available PDF): the document has a text layer and clean digital rendering (created in Word, not scanned), but **lacks fillable fields** — a patient must print it and complete it by hand. The layout is well-organized with a logical flow: patient demographics → facility selection → recipient → delivery method → record types → purpose → legal terms → signature. Record type selection is granular (15+ checkboxes including behavioral health, pathology, and imaging). Page 3 provides a helpful contact directory for all RWJBH facility HIM departments. Legal text on page 2 is dense but not impenetrably so. The facility checkbox grid on page 1 is visually crowded but functional. The older CMC-specific forms (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans with zero accessibility — no text layer, no fillable fields, no screen reader support.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-3 includes anti-conditioning language ("my refusal will not affect the start, continuation or quality of my medical treatment") and clear revocation rights. No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is **vague**: records are free when sent to another provider for care, but "there may be a fee" for other requests with no schedule or amounts provided. HIPAA cost-based fee limits for patient access are not mentioned. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The 180-day authorization expiration is reasonable.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods** on form-3: paper pickup, US Mail, encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format" — far better than most ROI forms.
- **Online portal** (Swellbox) provides a fully digital pathway alongside PDF forms.
- **Comprehensive contact directory** (page 3) with phone and fax for every RWJBH HIM department.
- **Multiple submission channels**: fax, email, online portal, and mail.

## Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any PDF form despite digital creation.
- **Generic authorization form** — no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow.
- **Opaque fee disclosure** — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.
- **Legacy CMC forms** (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans that remain linked on the website alongside the modern system-wide form, creating potential confusion.

## Overall Assessment

Community Medical Center earns a **B** overall. The organization benefits significantly from the Swellbox online portal and strong delivery method options on the system-wide form. The retrieval experience is easy and multiple submission channels exist. However, the PDF forms are non-fillable and generic, the fee disclosure is vague, and there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow. The coexistence of legacy image-only scans alongside a modern system-wide form reflects incomplete digital modernization.

# Saratoga Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Saratoga Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Saratoga Springs, NY, now part of the **Albany Med Health System (AMHS)**. Its original website (saratogahospital.org) redirects to albanymed.org/saratoga/. Two authorization forms were found: an older Saratoga Hospital–specific form (form-1.pdf, dated 2020) and the current system-wide AMHS form (form-2.pdf, dated November 2024). The system-wide form is the one actively linked from the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page and is the primary form a patient would encounter today.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release, Not Patient Access

Neither form offers a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both are titled "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" and are structured as third-party release authorizations. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Release Information To" / "Disclose To" field and select a purpose — an awkward workaround for what should be a straightforward right-of-access request. There is no checkbox, section, or simplified flow for "I want my own records." Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or explains patient access rights beyond the right to revoke authorization.

The system-wide form (form-2) does include a sidebar callout to **MyChart** (mychart.albanymed.org), the AMHS patient portal, as an alternative pathway. This is a meaningful digital option, though the form does not clarify what records are accessible through MyChart or whether it satisfies a full records request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A general web search returned direct links, and the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page is accessible without login or bot blocking. The only complexity is the redirect from the Saratoga Hospital domain to Albany Med, which could momentarily confuse a patient searching by the old hospital name. Both PDFs downloaded without difficulty.

## Form Document Quality (Primary: form-2.pdf)

The system-wide form is a strong technical document. It is a digitally constructed PDF (not a scan) with **65 fillable fields** — an unusually high count indicating comprehensive interactive coverage. Patients can complete every field on-screen without printing. The form spans 2 pages with a logical layout: patient demographics → record type selection → facility selection → sensitive information initials → recipient details → delivery method (page 1), then legal disclosures and signatures (page 2).

Record type options are granular (13 categories plus "Other"), and the form includes an "Entire Record" checkbox — an option absent from the older form-1. Delivery methods include email, fax, mail (with CD/USB options), and in-person pick-up. The multi-facility checkboxes let patients specify which AMHS hospital(s) to release from.

The main weakness is page 2: a dense wall of legal text covering revocation rights, HIV/AIDS protections, re-disclosure warnings, and 42 CFR Part 2 — all in small print with no headings, bullets, or visual hierarchy. The language is written at a college reading level. The footer on both pages contains a typo ("Dislcose" instead of "Disclose").

## Barriers

**Fee concern**: Both forms state a **$0.75/page copy fee** (phrased as "$0.75 cents per page" — a formatting error). The fee is waived for physician-to-physician transfers but not explicitly waived for patient self-access. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, per-page fees are generally impermissible; only reasonable cost-based fees are allowed. This is the most significant compliance concern.

**No witness required**: The newer system-wide form (form-2) removed the witness signature line that appeared on the legacy form-1 — a clear improvement.

**No notarization or in-person requirement**: Patients can submit by fax, email, or mail, satisfying the electronic submission baseline.

**No response time stated**: Neither form commits to a turnaround timeline.

## Notable Strengths

- **65 fillable fields** on the primary form — one of the most digitally complete ROI forms encountered
- **MyChart portal alternative** mentioned directly on the form
- **Granular record type and sensitive-information controls** with separate initials for HIV, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing
- **Multi-facility coverage** — a single form for all four AMHS hospitals reduces confusion

## Overall Assessment

Saratoga Hospital, via the Albany Med Health System, provides a technically polished and easily findable authorization form with excellent fillable-field coverage and a MyChart alternative. However, the experience is undermined by the complete absence of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must navigate a third-party release framework to exercise their individual access rights. The $0.75/page fee applied without distinguishing patient access from third-party release is a compliance concern. The form is a solid B-level document in terms of technical quality, but the lack of patient-centeredness and fee ambiguity hold back the overall score.

# EyeSouth Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a practice management organization (PMO) headquartered in Atlanta, GA, operating a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. It is a HIPAA covered entity with a designated Privacy Officer, but the corporate website is entirely partnership-focused with no patient-facing content. Two ROI forms were retrieved — neither from EyeSouth Partners itself, but from individual affiliates: Center for Sight (Florida) and Georgia Retina (Georgia).

## Available Pathways

A patient seeking records from an EyeSouth Partners affiliate faces a fragmented landscape. The parent organization offers no downloadable form, no patient portal, and no records request page. Its privacy policy directs patients to write to the Privacy Officer at corporate headquarters — a mail-only pathway with no form to guide the request. Individual affiliates handle records requests independently: some offer downloadable PDF forms (Center for Sight, Georgia Retina), others use third-party online portals like Sharecare (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye Partners), and at least one has a broken forms page (Georgia Eye Partners, returning 404).

The most relevant forms for patient self-access are the two retrieved PDF forms. **Form 1** (Center for Sight) is a concise, plain-language "Medical Information Release Form" with a patient-friendly tone and 10-business-day processing commitment. **Form 2** (Georgia Retina) is a more detailed "Authorization for Use, Release, or Request of Your Health Information" with HIPAA rights statements but also a $25 fee disclosure and a reason-for-release requirement. Both are one-page, single-purpose authorization forms. Form 1 represents the better patient experience overall and is treated as the primary form for scoring purposes.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to move records "to or from" the affiliated practice. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal right to their own records without needing to provide a reason. The parent organization provides no pathway at all — a patient who only knows they received care "under EyeSouth Partners" would struggle to find any usable process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms required significant effort. Direct searches for "EyeSouth Partners" ROI forms returned nothing. The corporate website has no patient resources section. Forms were located only by identifying specific affiliated practices and searching their individual websites. This multi-step, knowledge-dependent process is a major barrier: a patient must already know which specific practice treated them, find that practice's website, and hope a form is posted there.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms have a text layer (not image-only scans) but **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete by hand. Form 1 uses plain, accessible language with a logical top-down flow (patient info → sender/receiver → date range → reasons → authorization → signature). Its listing of 11 Center for Sight locations with full addresses and fax numbers is dense but functional for identifying where to send the form. Form 2 is more text-dense, with rights disclosures consuming half the page and no visual section headers or dividers. Neither form offers checkboxes for record types, format/delivery options, or electronic submission instructions.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form 1 contains an indefinite authorization ("will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing") with no automatic expiration — potentially problematic under HIPAA § 164.508. Form 2 discloses a flat $25 fee for record reproduction without distinguishing patient access requests (where HIPAA fee limits apply) from third-party releases. Form 2 also asks patients to "list the reason for releasing this information," which HIPAA does not require for patient access. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both imply fax submission is available through listed fax numbers. Form 2 is dated June 2016 — nearly a decade old, predating the HHS Right of Access Initiative and the Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Notable Strengths

- Form 1's 10-business-day processing commitment sets a clear, HIPAA-compliant expectation
- Form 1's warm closing ("we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care") is unusually humanizing
- Both forms are appropriately concise at one page each
- No notarization or witness requirements on either form

## Overall Assessment

EyeSouth Partners presents a below-average patient experience for records access. The fundamental problem is structural: a decentralized PMO with no centralized patient-facing process, forcing patients to navigate affiliate-specific pathways that vary widely in approach and quality. The best available forms are generic authorization documents that don't recognize patient self-access as a distinct use case. While the forms themselves are functional and concise, their paper-first design (no fillable fields), lack of patient rights language, and compliance issues (indefinite authorization, flat fee, reason requirement) prevent them from achieving more than a middling score. The organization earns a **C** grade, reflecting adequate but unexceptional service that requires a patient to work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights.

# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center provides three downloadable documents, but only one is relevant for patient self-access: **form-3.pdf**, the current "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (CONS00337, dated LRH 01/22). This single-page PDF is linked from the organization's [Medical Records page](https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/) and is the actively maintained ROI form. An older version of the same form (form-1.pdf, dated 04/16) remains publicly accessible at a separate URL but is no longer linked from the site. The third document (form-2.pdf) is an LRH Physicians Group Release/Authorization Form — a multi-purpose intake/consent bundle covering insurance assignment, billing, and treatment consent — and is not a patient-initiated records request form.

In addition to the PDF form, the organization offers a **Swellbox digital intake wizard** (http://www.swellbox.com/lakeland-wizard.html) as an alternative electronic pathway, which is a meaningful digital option for patients who prefer not to deal with paper.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lakeland Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (form-3) is a generic HIPAA authorization with bidirectional language — "to disclose my PHI to" and "to obtain my PHI from" — using checkboxes for each direction. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should check "to disclose my PHI to" and enter their own name and address as the recipient, an unintuitive workflow. There is no dedicated patient access form, no simplified request pathway, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). The form treats patient self-access identically to third-party release, including applying the same fee structure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Lakeland Regional Health medical records release form returned direct PDF links immediately, and the Medical Records page is straightforward to locate via site navigation. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor concern is that the superseded 2016 version remains publicly accessible without any "outdated" marking, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-3) is a **clean, digitally-authored single-page PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is logical and reasonably organized, flowing from patient identification through recipient details, date range, delivery method, record type checkboxes (13 categories plus "Other"), sensitive information notice, five legal clauses, and signature blocks. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — the numbered "I understand that..." clauses are reasonably accessible, though the fee reference to Florida statutes without disclosing actual amounts is opaque.

Three delivery options are offered: Paper, Electronic (email), and MyChart Patient Portal — a forward-thinking inclusion. The form provides granular record-type selection with 13 specific categories, and includes a patient-protective redaction option for mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records.

## Barriers

**Fee disclosure** is a notable weakness: patients must "agree to pay charges... per Florida Statute 395.3025 or Florida Administrative Code 64B8-10.003" without knowing what those charges are. This state fee schedule reference may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests, and the form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release fee structures.

A **witness signature line** appears on the form without clear indication of whether it is required or optional. If required, this creates a logistical barrier for patients completing the form at home or remotely. The form also collects the **last four digits of SSN**, which is unnecessary when MRN, name, DOB, and address are already requested. A "Photo ID verified" checkbox is ambiguous — if interpreted as requiring in-person ID presentation, it could conflict with electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Swellbox digital intake** provides a fully electronic alternative pathway
- **MyChart Patient Portal** as a delivery option leverages existing infrastructure
- **Granular record-type selection** (13 categories) gives patients meaningful control
- **Sensitive information redaction option** with explicit notice is a patient-protective feature
- **Single-page conciseness** keeps the form efficient and reduces patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Lakeland Regional Health provides a **serviceable but undifferentiated** records request experience. The form is easy to find, concise, and reasonably well-organized, with some genuinely patient-friendly features (granular record selection, redaction option, MyChart delivery). However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access, failing to disclose fees, and including potentially unnecessary requirements (witness, partial SSN). The availability of Swellbox as a digital alternative partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF, but the core form experience remains paper-first. The organization earns credit for accessibility and findability but loses ground on patient-centeredness and compliance nuances.

# Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph offers two versions of the same general-purpose ROI authorization form (Form #3014) linked from different pages of its website. Form-1 (dated 03/28/2019) is the current version, found on the Health Information Management page under "Authorizations and Forms." Form-2 (dated 11/24/2015) is an older version linked from the Privacy Policy > HIPAA Authorization Form page. Both are flat (non-fillable) PDFs. A third version in .docx format with entirely outdated "Heartland Health" branding was also discoverable via web search. The organization additionally uses Epic MyChart as a patient portal, though the ROI forms make no mention of it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mosaic Life Care does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both form versions are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request to Another Agency," framing the process as a release of records to a third party. A patient wanting their own records must fill in themselves as both the requesting party and the recipient. While "Personal" appears among 12 purpose options, there is no language, section, or streamlined flow that addresses HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) as a distinct use case. The form does not reference the Right of Access by name, does not explain associated timelines or fee limits, and does not mention the patient portal as an alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were relatively easy to find — 2–3 clicks from the homepage via the HIM page. Site-specific search also surfaced the relevant pages. The main complication is fragmentation: two versions of the same form (same form number) are published simultaneously on different pages with no indication of which supersedes the other. This creates a risk that patients encounter the outdated 2015 version, which still references the organization's former name ("Heartland Regional Medical Center") in its legal disclaimer.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) has a text layer and is not a scan, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore placeholders, requiring the patient to print and handwrite responses. The 2-page form follows a logical flow (demographics → source facility → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature) and uses a two-column layout that makes efficient use of space. The 13-category record type checklist with an "Other" option provides granular control over what is released. However, the language mixes plain and legal styles, with the deceased-patient section and legal disclaimers being notably dense. The form requires a purpose selection ("must select one"), which is not required under HIPAA for patient self-access requests.

## Barriers and Notable Issues

No notarization is required. Forms can be submitted via email (ROI@myMLC.com), fax, or mail — multiple electronic submission channels are available, and in-person delivery is not required. However, form-1 says nothing about fees, while the older form-2 vaguely mentions records "may be subject to copying fees" without specifying amounts or HIPAA fee limits. No response time commitment is stated. The mandatory purpose field is a potential compliance concern for patient self-access requests. An "Identification type / Verified by" line on the form could mislead patients into thinking in-person ID verification is required, though the form can be submitted remotely.

## Strengths

The standout bright spot is the 15-language assistance notice on page 2 of form-1, covering an unusually comprehensive set of languages including Pennsylvania Dutch and Trukese — reflecting attention to local community demographics. The granular record type selection and multiple submission channels (email, fax, mail) are also positive features.

## Overall Assessment

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph provides a reasonably findable but fundamentally paper-oriented ROI process that funnels all requesters — including patients seeking their own records — through a generic third-party release authorization. The form quality is adequate with logical organization and good scope controls, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and missing fee/timeline information limit patient-centeredness. The organization earns a **C grade**, reflecting an acceptable but unremarkable approach to patient record access that meets minimum requirements without demonstrating meaningful investment in the patient self-access experience.

# Synthesis: Aurora Medical Center - Grafton

## Overview

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton is a community hospital in Grafton, Wisconsin, operated by Advocate Health (formerly Advocate Aurora Health). The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones, drawing from Aurora Health Care's centralized medical records infrastructure. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also directs patients to its LiveWell patient portal for online record access.

## Forms and Pathways

Three forms were downloaded:

- **Form-1 and Form-2** are identical copies (same form number S300503 Rev. 11/25, same byte size) of the general "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a third-party release form designed for authorizing disclosure to other providers, insurers, or attorneys. Two URLs exist for the same document, a minor source of confusion.
- **Form-3** is a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" (S88411-EN Rev. 11/25) — explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It features a "Myself" checkbox, omits the purpose-of-release requirement, and opens with a callout to the LiveWell patient portal.

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3**. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, separate from the third-party authorization, is a meaningful structural choice that many organizations fail to make.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Aurora clearly differentiates individual access from third-party release. Form-3 is titled and structured around the patient's own request — no "Release the Requested Information to" recipient block, no purpose-of-release field, and a prominent "Myself" option. The patient portal callout ("Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org") is placed at the very top of the form, proactively directing patients to a faster digital channel before they even begin filling out the paper form. This is a best-practice design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Aurora Health Care maintains a well-organized medical records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records`, reachable in about two clicks from the homepage. The page clearly lists all available forms with download links, including English and Spanish versions, instruction sheets, restriction request forms, accounting of disclosures, and revocation forms. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The forms also appeared in web search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean typography and logical section flow: patient demographics → treatment context → record type selection → recipient → delivery method → signature. The record-type selection is impressively granular, with 22+ checkbox options spanning medical records, imaging by modality, billing documents, and laboratory reports. The language is plain and accessible — the sensitive-information acknowledgment is straightforward without being alarming.

However, despite being digitally produced, form-3 has **zero interactive fillable fields**. All checkboxes are static glyphs, and all blanks require handwriting. This is the form's most significant weakness — adding fillable fields would be trivial for the design team and would dramatically improve the digital experience. The form is designed as a print-and-fill artifact published as a PDF.

## Submission and Delivery

The medical records page lists multiple submission methods: email, fax, mail, and in-person delivery. The form itself offers multiple delivery methods for receiving records: paper by mail, encrypted email, CD, patient portal, and in-person pickup. Offering both encrypted email and patient portal as electronic delivery options is progressive. The note "(Fees may apply)" appears but no fee amounts or schedule are provided — a common ambiguity.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The form correctly omits a purpose-of-release requirement for patient access. Non-discrimination language is present on the third-party form. Minor authorization provisions are detailed and legally careful. The main compliance gap is the vague fee disclosure — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

## Overall Assessment

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton, through its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form, a patient portal alternative, Spanish translations, and granular record-type selection. The retrieval experience is excellent and the content design is clear and well-organized. The primary weakness is the non-fillable PDF format, which forces a paper workflow despite the form being digitally authored. This technical gap prevents the organization from reaching the top tier, but the overall experience is solidly good — a patient requesting their own records has a clear, well-documented pathway with multiple submission and delivery options.

**Grade: B** (weighted score: 4.15/5.0)

# Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Chandler, AZ, with eight office locations across the Phoenix metro area. Three documents were retrieved: an incoming records request form (form-1), the primary outbound ROI authorization form (form-2), and a new patient forms packet from a sister site (form-3). Only form-2 serves a patient requesting their own records from Ironwood.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Ironwood does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-2, a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" designed to serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party release, legal, insurance, and disability. The form uses a "To" and "From" field structure oriented toward third-party transfers, which can confuse patients seeking their own records. However, "Personal Use" is explicitly listed as the first purpose option, which partially signals awareness of patient self-access as a legitimate use case.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or use individual-access-specific language. A patient must navigate a form designed around third-party release and determine which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the ROI form required **moderate-to-significant effort**. The patient forms page at ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/ existed but did not expose downloadable links — possibly due to JavaScript rendering requirements or link removal. The primary ROI form (form-2) was only discoverable via site-specific search engine queries. Its URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/`) suggests it dates from March 2019 and may be effectively orphaned. Ironically, the incoming records form (form-1) was updated more recently (November 2023) and is fillable, suggesting the organization invested in making it easy for other providers to send records to Ironwood while neglecting the patient-facing release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable/interactive fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a notable gap, especially given that form-1 (the incoming records form) has 22 fillable fields. The asymmetry suggests intentional or negligent underinvestment in the patient-facing document.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → record types → date range → purpose → delivery method → legal disclosures → signatures. Seven record type categories (physician's notes, lab reports, radiology reports, biopsy reports, prescriptions, radiology imaging, plus "Other") provide reasonable granularity for a cancer center. Five delivery methods are offered: fax, secure email, mail, pick up, and patient portal — a strong set of options including two electronic channels beyond fax.

The form lacks any introductory instructions or plain-language guidance. Legal disclosures are presented in dense paragraph format on page 2, though "I UNDERSTAND THAT" headers provide some scannability. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions available.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fee disclosure is vague: "A fee may be charged for providing the protected health information" — no amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees. This ambiguity could discourage patients.

No notarization or witness signature is required. The non-conditioning statement is present and appropriate. Revocation rights are clearly stated. The authorization expires after one year, which is standard.

A notable red flag on form-1 (though not the primary patient form): the STD definition section cites Washington state law (RCW 70.24) despite Ironwood being an Arizona practice — a template-copy error that raises questions about form review diligence.

## Strengths

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: Offering secure email and patient portal alongside fax, mail, and pickup gives patients meaningful choice — better than many comparable practices.
- **"Personal Use" as an explicit purpose**: Listing this as the first purpose option is a small but meaningful signal of patient access awareness.
- **Reasonable record type granularity**: The checkbox categories are well-suited to oncology records.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable patient form vs. fillable provider form**: The clearest indicator of misaligned priorities.
- **Orphaned form**: Not linked from any active webpage; discoverable only via search engines.
- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Generic authorization for all release types.
- **Vague fee language**: Could deter patients from exercising their access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers provides a **minimally adequate** but clearly deprioritized pathway for patient self-access to records. The generic authorization form technically works for patient self-access, and the inclusion of electronic delivery options (secure email, patient portal) is a genuine strength. However, the non-fillable form, orphaned web presence, vague fee language, and lack of any patient-access-specific design collectively signal that individual record access is not a priority for this organization. A patient can get their records, but only after navigating search engines to find a form that wasn't designed for them.

# Lane County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lane County Hospital is a government-owned, independent critical access hospital in Dighton, Kansas. The facility offers a single pathway for medical records requests: a one-page PDF authorization form available on its website. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient self-access form.

## Available Pathways and Form Classification

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "Authorization for Release of Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for third-party release of information. It uses the standard disclosure structure — "I authorize [entity] to disclose... to [name]" — which frames the transaction as releasing records to someone other than the patient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the authorizing party and the recipient, navigating a form that was not designed with their use case in mind.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access requests and third-party authorization releases. There is no separate patient access request form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 individual access rights, and no streamlined process for patients who simply want to review or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was exceptionally easy. A basic web search immediately identified the hospital's Records Request page, which contains a single "Click Here" link to the PDF. No login, bot blocking, or portal navigation was required. For a small rural hospital, this level of web accessibility is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally created PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore lines, requiring the patient to print the form and complete it by hand (or use third-party PDF annotation tools). The form is one page long with a logical flow: patient identification at top, authorization body, 16 record-type checkboxes, legal disclosures, and signature block. The record-type checkboxes offer strong granularity — 16 categories from Anesthesia Records to Social Work Reports — giving patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.

The language is a mix of plain language and standard legal boilerplate. Some sentences are convoluted ("I understand that I may refuse to sign this Authorization and that my treatment of payment for my treatment will not be affected...") but the form is generally readable. The title contains a typo ("HEATH" instead of "HEALTH") that has persisted since at least 2018. "Psychotherapy Notes" appears twice in the checkbox list, and a cryptic "RESOURCE: MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FORM" reference at the bottom could confuse patients.

## Submission and Barriers

The form directs patients to return it via **fax** to one of two numbers. No email, mail, or online submission option is mentioned. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway.

Two unnecessary barriers stand out. First, the form requests a **Social Security Number**, which is not required for HIPAA-compliant release processing and creates identity theft risk on a form routinely transmitted by fax. Second, a **witness signature line** creates an implicit expectation that a witness is needed, though HIPAA does not require one for valid authorization. Together these add friction and potential deterrence for patients acting alone.

No fees are mentioned. The form includes solid compliance elements: an expiration field, a citation of Kansas SB 119's one-year authorization limit, and clear revocation instructions naming the Privacy Officer with full contact information.

## Overall Assessment

Lane County Hospital makes its records request form easy to find and keeps it concise at one page with good record-type granularity. However, the form funnels all requesters — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization designed for disclosure to others, not for individual access. The lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, and the witness signature line create unnecessary friction. For a small critical access hospital, the web accessibility is commendable, but the form itself reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-centered approach to individual access rights.

# GI Alliance — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

GI Alliance is a large, for-profit physician practice management organization headquartered in Southlake, TX, operating dozens of affiliated gastroenterology practices nationwide. Three forms were retrieved: one text-based authorization form from the main gialliance.com website (form-1), and two image-only scanned forms from affiliate practices Granite Peaks GI (form-2) and University GI (form-3). Form-1 is the canonical, centrally published document and represents the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Dedicated Patient Route

GI Alliance does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information," while forms 2 and 3 are explicitly titled "Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party." None reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or acknowledge the distinct legal framework for patient self-access versus third-party authorization (§ 164.508).

Form-1 does include a "at Patient's request" checkbox under the purpose section, making it technically usable for patient-directed requests, but the form structure — requiring a recipient address, lacking delivery format preferences, and using authorization language throughout — treats the patient as just another requester rather than an individual exercising a legal right. This conflation could cause the organization to inadvertently apply third-party authorization rules (higher fees, broader denial grounds) to patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the primary form was relatively straightforward. A site-specific web search surfaced form-1 directly at a WordPress uploads URL. GI Alliance maintains a patient forms page at `gialliance.com/patient-forms-and-prep/`, but it is organized by local brand/location, adding navigational complexity for patients who must first identify their affiliate practice. The affiliate forms (forms 2 and 3) required searching beyond the main domain. No login wall, bot blocking, or portal gating was encountered. Retrieval difficulty: easy for the main form, moderate for the affiliate variants.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available document, is a single-page text-based PDF authored digitally in Microsoft Word — a significant quality advantage over the affiliate scans. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are rendered as underscores, requiring the patient to print and handwrite. There is no electronic signature capability and no submit button. The form must be printed, completed by hand, and returned — but critically, **no submission method is specified anywhere on the form** (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link). A patient who downloads this form has no way to know where to send it without calling the organization.

The layout is logical, following standard authorization flow: patient identification → recipient → scope → sensitive categories → purpose → duration/revocation → signature. However, there are no bold section headers, no instructional text, and the language is moderately legalistic (e.g., "d/b/a GI Alliance on behalf of itself and all other practices that are operating as a single HIPAA Affiliated Covered Entity"). The form is concise at one page, which is a positive.

The affiliate forms (2 and 3) are substantially worse in quality: form-2 is a browser print-to-PDF with a completely garbled text layer (broken Type 3 font encoding), and form-3 is a raw scan with no text layer at all. Both are inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally. Form-3 appears to be truncated, missing required HIPAA authorization elements like the signature block and revocation instructions.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blank provider identity**: Form-1 leaves both the authorizing entity name and the revocation mailing address as blank fill-ins, creating a functional barrier for patients who don't know which affiliate practice to name.
- **No submission instructions**: None of the three forms specify where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees or the patient's right to cost-based pricing under HIPAA.
- **No processing timeline**: No indication of how long records fulfillment will take.
- **SSN collection**: Forms 2 and 3 request the last four digits of SSN — unnecessary for HIPAA record requests and a potential deterrent.
- **No delivery format options**: Form-1 does not ask how the patient wants to receive records; forms 2 and 3 offer only "E-Delivery" and "Mail."

## Bright Spots

- **Sensitive information categories**: Form-1 requires separate initials for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance use, and genetic information — a compliance-conscious design respecting state-level protections.
- **Explicit non-conditioning statement**: The clear declaration that treatment/payment won't be conditioned on signing is present and well-stated.
- **Concise format**: Form-1 covers all essential elements on a single page without being excessively dense.
- **Granular record selection** (affiliate forms): Forms 2 and 3 offer 9-10 specific record-type checkboxes, giving patients meaningful control over what information is released.

## Overall Assessment

GI Alliance provides a minimally adequate but patient-unfriendly records request experience. The organization channels all access requests — whether from patients, insurers, or attorneys — through a single generic authorization framework with no acknowledgment that patient self-access is a distinct right with its own legal protections. The primary form is digitally authored but not fillable, includes no submission instructions, and leaves critical fields (provider name, revocation address) blank. A patient attempting to request their own records online would download a form they cannot fill digitally, would not know where to send it, and would receive no guidance about fees, timelines, or their rights. The experience reflects organizational indifference to patient self-service rather than intentional obstruction.

# Desert Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Regional Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Palm Springs, CA, operated by Desert Care Network, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare. Two forms were found: an English-language ROI authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are 2-page digitally created PDFs available from a dedicated medical records page on the Desert Care Network website.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

Desert Regional does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization for the Release of Health Information" and are structured as third-party disclosure authorizations — the patient authorizes Desert Regional to release records *to* a named recipient. A patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient, an awkward workaround that conflates the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) with the authorization framework of § 164.508. There is no separate form, section, or instructions addressing patient self-access as a distinct use case.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient/patient representative" as one option, but "Continuation of Care" appears as the default/first option, further underscoring the form's third-party orientation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A direct `filetype:pdf` search yielded nothing, but a site-specific search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/patients/request-medical-records`. That page is well-organized, with per-hospital download links in both English and Spanish. Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic downloads, requiring browser-based workarounds — though a patient using a standard browser would not encounter this. Overall, the form is roughly 2–3 clicks from the homepage via a logical navigation path.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is digitally authored with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite. This is a significant missed opportunity given the digital-native construction. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, recipient info, 12 record-type checkboxes, date range, purpose, and delivery method. The layout is logical and readable, following a clear top-to-bottom sequence. Language tilts toward legal/administrative but is not impenetrably dense; the rights section uses standard HIPAA authorization language with four-exception conditional clauses that could benefit from plain-language explanation.

Delivery method options include patient pickup, mail, fax, and email — the inclusion of email is a positive differentiator. The form header provides phone, fax, and email contact for the HIM department, giving patients multiple submission channels.

## Spanish Translation Quality

The Spanish form (form-2.pdf) mirrors the English version in structure and content, but suffers from **pervasive typographical errors** — at least 9 distinct misspellings including "APCIENTE" (PACIENTE), "cofidencialidad" (confidencialidad), and "DIVILGACIÓN" (DIVULGACIÓN). More consequentially, the Spanish form **omits the delivery method section** entirely, meaning Spanish-speaking patients cannot indicate how they want to receive their records. The fax number in the Spanish header also appears truncated. These errors suggest the translation was not professionally reviewed and create a meaningful disparity in service quality for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no mandatory in-person submission, and no explicit fee requirements. Revocation rights and authorization expiration are clearly stated. However, the form says nothing about fees — neither disclosing them nor stating they don't apply for patient access. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, and the rights section covers only authorization-related rights (voluntariness, revocation). There is no mention of electronic health information export or the patient's right to receive records in their requested format.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful for the Coachella Valley's large Spanish-speaking population
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear, per-hospital download links
- **Email as a delivery option** is more progressive than many ROI forms
- **Multiple HIM contact channels** (phone, fax, email) on the form header

## Overall Assessment

Desert Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The primary pathway is a generic third-party release form with no differentiation for patient self-access — a common but patient-unfriendly pattern. The form is reasonably well-organized and findable, but the lack of fillable fields and the poor quality of the Spanish translation diminish the overall experience. A patient can submit via fax or email (adequate electronic pathways), but must first print and handwrite the form. The organization earns credit for bilingual availability and a clear website presence, but falls short on patient-centeredness and digital accessibility.

# UF Health Shands Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UF Health Shands Hospital, a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Gainesville, Florida, offers patients a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all record requests. Four versions of this form (form family PS46283/RI0001) were found online, but only one — form-2.pdf, revised 5/30/19 — is linked from the official medical records page. No dedicated patient self-access pathway exists; patients requesting their own records use the same authorization form designed for third-party release.

## Forms and Pathways

The primary form (form-2.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF linked from ufhealth.org/medical-records. Three additional variants persist online: form-1.pdf (a 2015 revision with more detailed identity verification and numbered sections), form-3.pdf (a 2014 legacy version with a liability waiver and HealthPort electronic delivery), and form-4.pdf (a clinic-specific variant pre-filled for the Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment). All share the same form code and general structure. The coexistence of multiple undifferentiated versions at different URLs creates a risk that patients or providers encounter outdated forms via search engines.

Submission options are mail and fax, both clearly printed on form-2. The medical records page also lists a phone number. An in-person pick-up option is noted on the form. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway per the scoring baseline.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UF Health Shands does **not** offer a differentiated patient self-access pathway. The form is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — the HIPAA authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than the Right of Access framework (§ 164.524). The sole accommodation for patients requesting their own records is a small "Check here if same as patient" checkbox in the "To" field. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, does not distinguish fee structures for patient access versus third-party release, and does not include any language framing the request as an individual access right.

That said, the form does include "Personal Use" as an explicit purpose option, and the identity verification fields in the representative section are marked "Internal use only," appropriately sparing patients from producing documentation at the time of form completion.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a cleanly designed, born-digital single-page PDF — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally composed (8 fonts, no embedded images, only 95 KB), the form requires printing and handwriting. This is a persistent gap across all four form versions, suggesting an organizational decision rather than a legacy issue.

The layout is logical: patient demographics → from/to routing → facility selection → record types → dates/purpose/format → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. Sixteen record-type checkboxes (including separated sensitive-information categories for behavioral health, substance use disorder, STD/HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing) provide excellent granularity. The legal disclosure section uses reasonably clear language with helpful parentheticals (e.g., "revoke it in writing (i.e., tell UF Health to cancel it)"), though the opening corporate entity definition paragraph is dense legalese.

Delivery format options include MyUFHealth (the patient portal), CD, and paper — the portal option is a notable modern addition, though it serves as a delivery mechanism rather than a request submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization, witness signatures, or in-person submission is required. Authorization expires after one year with clear revocation rights. However, the fee disclosure — "up to $1.00 per page (plus applicable tax and handling) for Paper Records" — is applied uniformly without distinguishing patient access from third-party release. For patient self-access under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4), HIPAA limits fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts; the $1.00/page rate (reflecting Florida's statutory schedule for third-party releases) may exceed this standard. No response time commitment is stated.

The older form-3 includes a liability waiver ("I hereby release and discharge UF Health...from any liability"), which is an additional barrier not present in the current primary form.

## Overall Assessment

UF Health Shands provides an easily findable, well-organized, and compact authorization form, but falls short in two critical areas: (1) the complete absence of fillable PDF fields forces a paper-based workflow, and (2) the generic authorization framework fails to differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The fee language, while standard for Florida third-party releases, is potentially non-compliant when applied to patient access requests. The form earns credit for its granular record-type selection, explicit "Personal Use" purpose option, MyUFHealth portal delivery, and patient-friendly touches like marking verification fields as internal-use-only — but these bright spots don't compensate for the fundamental lack of a patient-centered access pathway and the print-and-handwrite workflow.

# Guthrie Corning Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Guthrie Corning Hospital is a community hospital in Corning, NY, operating within the Guthrie Clinic regional health system. All medical records forms are published at the system level by Guthrie Clinic and apply uniformly across its facilities (Corning, Troy, Cortland, Robert Packer, and Towanda Campus). Three documents were found: a general-purpose ROI authorization form (form-1), a family/friends access authorization (form-2), and a companion instruction sheet with fees and contact information (form-3).

## Best Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1**, the "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form — it serves all release purposes (provider-to-provider, legal, insurance, personal use) rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient must select "Personal Use" from a list of purpose options alongside "Legal," "Insurance," and "Lay Caregiver." The form does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508. Form-2 (family access) is irrelevant for patient self-access. Form-3 (instructions) supplements form-1 with submission details and fees.

The instruction sheet mentions that "Continuation of care requests may also be completed thru your individual eGuthrie/MyChart account," hinting at a patient portal pathway, but no detail is provided and this does not appear to cover general patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were **easy to find**. A basic web search immediately returned the PDF, and the Guthrie website's medical records page (guthrie.org/medical-records) serves as a well-organized hub. No bot blocking, JavaScript barriers, or login was required. All three documents were directly downloadable.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF**. It has zero interactive fields — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. Despite being digitally authored (not a scan), it was designed as a print-and-fill document with blank lines and empty checkbox squares rather than interactive elements. The form uses 9 fonts and has a dense layout that packs patient demographics, facility selection, record type checkboxes, format options, recipient information, purpose, rights statements, sensitive information opt-outs, and signature into one page. This compression keeps the form brief but makes it visually crowded.

The form's organization is logical: numbered sections flow from facility selection through record types, format, recipient, purpose, rights, expiration, and sensitive information. Language is moderately legalistic — phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" use distancing third-person framing. The instruction to "Read Entire Document Before Signing" is helpful but insufficient as the only guidance on the form itself.

Notable content features include three format options (Paper Copy, Electronic CD/DVD, Electronic On-Line) and granular record type selection (discharge summary, H&P, operative report, radiology by modality, etc.), giving patients meaningful control.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees** are transparent: the companion instruction sheet states a $6.50 flat rate for personal-use electronic records (HIPAA-compliant) and explicitly notes no charge for provider-to-provider transfers. This fee transparency, while not on the form itself, is better than most organizations.

**Submission** is available by mail, fax, or in-person — fax provides an adequate electronic submission channel. No online or email submission is available.

**No notarization** is required. The form does request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary and may deter privacy-conscious patients. The sensitive information default is opt-out (drug/alcohol, HIV, mental health records are released unless the patient checks boxes to exclude them), which is less protective than an opt-in approach. Genetic information is mentioned with no opt-out at all.

Corning Hospital patients face a geographic nuance: the instruction sheet notes "No onsite support" for Corning, directing patients to contact Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA, and mail forms to that address. This could be disorienting for local patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Excellent findability with a well-organized central medical records page
- Single-page form keeps burden low
- Clear fee transparency with HIPAA-compliant pricing
- Granular record type and format selection including electronic options
- System-wide forms eliminate confusion across facilities

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable/interactive fields despite being a digitally-created PDF
- Generic authorization form with no dedicated patient access pathway
- No reference to patient's right of access under HIPAA
- Sensitive information defaults to release (opt-out rather than opt-in)
- Critical information (fees, submission addresses, fax numbers) split across a separate document
- No onsite medical records support at Corning Hospital itself

## Overall Assessment

Guthrie Corning Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find, the fee structure is transparent and compliant, and the single-page format keeps patient burden manageable. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization approach that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, and the reliance on a print-handwrite-fax workflow place it squarely in the middle tier of organizations studied. The process works, but it was not designed with the patient as the primary user.

# Vanderbilt University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Vanderbilt Health offers patients multiple pathways to request their medical records. The official medical records page at vanderbilthealth.com lists both downloadable PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish) and three online portals: a **Swellbox patient request portal**, a Swellbox provider request portal, and a ChartSwap third-party request portal. The separation of these portals by requester type — patient, provider, and third party — is a meaningful structural differentiator that many organizations lack.

Five PDF documents were discovered across Vanderbilt web properties. The current official English form is **form-4.pdf** (VMR 3017, dated 10/2023), a 2-page authorization linked from the main medical records page. Form-5 is its Spanish translation. Forms 1 and 2 are older versions (2022 and 2017 respectively) still publicly hosted on VUMC subdomains with no deprecation notice. Form-3 is an incoming-records form (release TO Vanderbilt) irrelevant to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Vanderbilt partially differentiates individual access from third-party release. At the portal level, the separation is clear: patients, providers, and third parties each have distinct Swellbox/ChartSwap entry points. However, at the PDF form level, Vanderbilt uses a single generic "Authorization for the Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — a HIPAA § 164.508 authorization form doing double duty for patient access requests that should technically fall under § 164.524 Right of Access. The form does correctly scope the purpose question in Section 8, noting it is only required "if not for your personal use," which recognizes patient self-access as the default. But the overall framing ("I hereby give Vanderbilt Health permission to disclose my individually identifiable protected health information") miscasts a patient right as a permission grant.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. The official vanderbilthealth.com medical records page clearly links both the English and Spanish PDFs under "Request Records by Authorization Form," and all downloads succeeded without bot blocking or login walls. The primary findability concern is that **outdated versions persist** on VUMC subdomains (student health, information privacy & security) — a patient searching Google could land on the 2017 or 2022 version, which has different fee structures, fewer facilities, and old branding, with no indication it's superseded.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4 is compact and well-organized, condensed from the older 4-page format to 2 pages with 10 numbered sections and clear bold headers. However, it is fundamentally an **image-only scan** — zero fillable fields, only 61 characters of extractable text, and no screen-reader accessibility. A patient must print it, complete it by hand, and submit via mail or fax. The electronic delivery option described in Section 4 (PDF through a request portal, directions sent to email) is a genuine patient-friendly feature. The fee schedule, while complex (6 scenarios), is transparently disclosed with all fees capped at $50 and a $6.50 flat rate for fully electronic delivery.

The form requests Last 4 SSN, which is more personal information than necessary. Section 9's acknowledgment section packs 11 bullet points of legal text in small font. The sensitive-information handling (Section 6) defaults to including psychiatric, substance use, and HIV information with an opt-out checkbox — permissible but puts the burden on the patient.

## Barriers and Strengths

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization or witness is required. Submission is possible via fax (adequate electronic pathway) and mail, plus the Swellbox portal provides a fully digital alternative. The 30-day response timeline is stated explicitly, and the form commits to no treatment conditioning. Fees are disclosed upfront and capped.

**Notable strengths** include: the Spanish-language version linked alongside the English form; the differentiated Swellbox patient portal as a digital alternative; the transparent and capped fee schedule; the correctly scoped purpose question; and the inclusion of an electronic delivery option via a request portal. The QR code on the form header may provide an additional pathway, though its destination isn't determinable from the PDF.

**Red flags** are the dual-purpose authorization framing, the persistence of outdated forms on subdomains, and the image-only scan format — surprising for a 2023 form from a major academic medical center that fails basic WCAG/Section 508 accessibility standards.

## Overall Assessment

Vanderbilt Health provides a **competent but imperfect** patient records request experience. The organization earns credit for offering differentiated digital pathways (Swellbox patient portal), a Spanish translation, transparent fees, and a well-organized 2-page form. It falls short on digital-first form design (image-only scan, no fillable fields) and conflates patient access rights with third-party authorization. The availability of the Swellbox portal as an alternative substantially mitigates the PDF's technical limitations, making this an organization that serves digitally-savvy patients reasonably well while leaving paper-dependent patients with an unnecessarily cumbersome experience.

# Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital is part of Samaritan Health Services (SHS), a nonprofit regional health system in Oregon's Willamette Valley. All records request forms and processes operate at the system level — there are no facility-specific forms for the Lebanon campus. Five documents were retrieved: a standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information in English (form-4) and Spanish (form-5), a specialized Computer Readable EHI Export Request in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3).

## Pathways Available

SHS offers three distinct pathways for patients requesting their own records:

1. **MRO Express Online Portal** — The primary pathway the website directs patients toward. This is an outsourced third-party portal (MRO Corp.) for submitting records requests online. No downloadable PDF is produced; the request is web-based.

2. **Standard Authorization Form (form-4/form-5)** — A general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" PDF covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Submittable by mail, fax, or email. Available in English and Spanish.

3. **EHI Computer Readable Export Form (form-1/form-2)** — A specialized form for requesting health information in machine-readable format. Also available in English and Spanish. This is a notably rare offering.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The standard form (form-4) is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it handles the distinction reasonably well: Section 3 includes a "Personal" checkbox for purpose, and Section 7 splits into "released to myself" (with multiple delivery options) versus "OR release my records to" a third party. This is a combined form, not a dedicated patient access pathway, but the dual structure is functional and the patient self-access route is clearly accommodated.

The EHI export form (form-1) is genuinely patient-centric — its purpose field comes pre-checked as "Patient Request - Electronic" and the entire form is designed around patient self-access. However, this serves only the niche use case of computer-readable data export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the downloadable forms was **difficult**. The medical records request page primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal. The PDF form download links are hidden inside a collapsed accordion section titled "Sending a Request by Mail or Fax" that required browser DevTools (JavaScript link extraction) to discover. Web searches returned confusable results from unrelated organizations with similar names. A patient who prefers a traditional form rather than the online portal would struggle to find the PDF.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-4) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean text and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete it by hand despite the form being digital in origin. The form uses numbered sections (1–9) with clear headers and a matching instruction page. The language mixes functional plain language with legal boilerplate; the rights section is dense but the instructions on page 2 are more accessible. Record type granularity is strong, with 11 specific checkboxes plus an "Other" field.

Format and delivery options are a genuine bright spot: patients can choose from MyChart, email, paper, CD, fax, or write in an alternative. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery, which is uncommon among ROI forms.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees**: The fee disclosure is exemplary. Form-4 explicitly states "Initial Patient Request: No Charge" and "Continuing Care: No Charge," with fees only for third-party requests. However, the EHI export form (form-1) lacks this "no charge" language, stating only that "reasonable cost-based fees apply" — an inconsistency that could deter patients seeking computer-readable data.

**Processing time**: Stated as "up to 30 days," within HIPAA's permitted window.

**No notarization** required. No in-person-only submission requirement — mail, fax, and email are all accepted.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by mail, fax (541-768-9363), or email (SHSHIMROI@samhealth.org). The email option is notable — it allows fully electronic submission even without the MRO portal, though the non-fillable PDF creates an awkward print-fill-scan-email workflow.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: All forms (standard ROI and EHI export) are available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Dedicated EHI export form**: Offering a separate form specifically for computer-readable health information export is exceptionally rare and demonstrates genuine Cures Act awareness.
- **Fee transparency**: The three-tier fee structure with "No Charge" for patient requests is clear and patient-friendly.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Six format options including two electronic channels (MyChart and email).
- **Email submission channel**: Accepting form submission via email lowers barriers significantly.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDFs**: All forms have zero interactive fields despite being digitally authored — a clear missed opportunity.
- **Hidden download links**: The downloadable forms are buried in collapsed accordion sections, requiring technical effort to discover.
- **No dedicated patient access form**: The standard form serves both patient self-access and third-party release, requiring patients to navigate which sections apply.
- **EHI export fee ambiguity**: The EHI form does not match the standard form's "no charge" commitment for patient requests.

## Overall Assessment

Samaritan Health Services provides a solid, above-average experience for patients requesting their own records. The combination of an online portal as the primary pathway, a well-structured authorization form with multiple delivery options, bilingual availability, transparent fee disclosures, and a rare dedicated EHI export form puts this organization ahead of most peers. The main gaps are the non-fillable PDF forms and the poor discoverability of the downloadable form option. The organization clearly takes patient access seriously, even if the form design hasn't been fully modernized for digital-first completion.

# Northwestern Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Northwestern Memorial Hospital, part of the Northwestern Medicine / Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) system, publishes three documents related to medical records requests. The primary form is **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form 8094, rev. 2/2026) — a system-wide ROI authorization covering all 11 NMHC hospitals, physician groups, and behavioral health locations. **Form-3.pdf** is a full Spanish translation of the same form (8094SP, rev. 8/2024). **Form-2.pdf** is a separate inbound records request form for transferring records *into* NMHC from other providers — not relevant for patient self-access.

All forms are published at the system level on nm.org and are used across all NMHC entities. Northwestern Memorial Hospital does not maintain facility-specific forms.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Northwestern Medicine does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to attorneys, insurers, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" as the purpose, then list themselves as the recipient in the "Send Information To" section. This is functional but unintuitive: the form was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) anywhere on the form. This matters because Right of Access requests carry different fee limits and timing requirements than third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was trivially easy. A basic web search returned direct download links to the PDFs hosted on nm.org's media CDN. No website navigation, login, CAPTCHA, or bot-blocking was encountered. The URLs are descriptive and the forms are well-organized in the patients-and-visitors section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **79 fillable fields** — text inputs, checkboxes, and date fields can all be completed digitally without printing. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → facility selection → purpose → record types → delivery method → medical images → recipient → legal disclosures → signatures. Record-type categories include helpful parenthetical explanations (e.g., "Hospital Stay (History and physical, progress notes, consultations, operative reports, discharge summary, test results)") that help patients understand what they're requesting. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The legal disclosure section is moderately dense but covers required elements: 30-day response window, right to revoke, no care denial for refusal to sign, and sensitive-record opt-outs (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic testing, mental health). The language is somewhat complex but not impenetrably legalistic.

## Submission and Delivery

Submission options are strong: mail (Winfield, IL), fax (312.926.3093), and email (releaseofinformation@nm.org). Delivery options are notably forward-looking: **MyNM patient portal**, fax, email, and US mail (CD or paper). The portal delivery option is a standout feature that removes a common access barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or in-person requirements exist. Fees are referenced vaguely — "Standard record copying fees per 735 ILCS 5/8-2006 may apply" — without specific amounts or clarification that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a cost-based amount. This ambiguity could lead patients to expect the (higher) Illinois statutory copying fees even for personal-use requests.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form** with the same 82 fillable fields — Spanish-speaking patients get equal digital functionality
- **MyNM portal delivery** alongside fax, email, and mail
- **Email submission** (still uncommon among healthcare organizations)
- **Memorable toll-free number**: 877.9RECORD with TTY: 711 support
- **Parenthetical record-type explanations** helping patients understand each category

## Notable Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway — generic authorization form for all release types
- No reference to HIPAA Right of Access or patient access rights
- Fee language references Illinois statute without distinguishing patient-access fee limits
- Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version (missing hospital renaming, updated 42 CFR Part 2 language, and TTY reference)

## Overall Assessment

Northwestern Medicine provides a technically strong, easy-to-find form ecosystem with excellent digital features (fillable fields, email submission, portal delivery, Spanish translation). The primary weakness is structural: the organization channels all records requests — including patient self-access — through a generic authorization form designed for third-party release, without acknowledging the distinct rights and fee limits that apply to individual access under HIPAA. The form works well for patients who know what they need, but it wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# Coast Plaza Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Coast Plaza Hospital provides two versions of the same "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form on its Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`). Form-1 (June 2024, labeled "FINAL") is the current version; form-2 (January 2022) remains publicly accessible alongside it with no indication of which is current. Both are general-purpose ROI authorization forms — not patient-access-specific documents. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is to download form-1, print and hand-fill it, and fax or mail it to the hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Coast Plaza Hospital does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms use a single "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" workflow. The "Information to be Released to" section asks for "Name of Hospital/Clinic/Physician/Person," framing the recipient as a third party. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in this field, which is unintuitive. While "Personal Use" appears as a purpose option and "Records for Personal Use" as a record-type checkbox, the relationship between these is ambiguous — it's unclear whether selecting one, the other, or both is needed. The form lacks any Right of Access language or statement of patient rights beyond standard authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Multiple search strategies succeeded: a filetype:pdf web search and a site-scoped search both led to the hospital's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering was required. Both PDFs downloaded directly with curl. The only findability concern is the co-existence of two versions without clear versioning — a patient could easily download the outdated 2022 form, which lists a different fax number that may no longer be monitored.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created 2-page PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All ~20+ data entry points (patient name, address, DOB, phone, email, recipient information, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, date range, delivery method, signature) must be completed by hand after printing. The layout is well-organized with bold section headers ("Patient Information," "Information to be Released From," etc.) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. Record types are arranged efficiently in two columns with 16+ individual categories. The language is moderately legalistic — first-person authorization statements are standard but dense. A "PATIENT LABEL" box on both pages is a clinical workflow artifact that may confuse patients completing the form at home.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No fillable fields**: Forces a fully paper-based completion workflow in a form that was digitally designed and could easily support interactive fields.
- **CD-only electronic delivery**: The only electronic format option is CD — functionally obsolete in 2024. No email, portal, or secure download option exists.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "I understand that there may be a fee associated with this request" provides no fee amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee standard, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not tell patients where to send the completed authorization. The hospital's fax number appears in the "Released From" section but is not framed as a return destination.
- **Outdated form still online**: The 2022 version with a different fax number remains downloadable, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record selection**: 16+ specific record types give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **Sensitive category separation**: Mental Health, Genetic Testing, Alcohol/Drug Abuse, and HIV/AIDS records require separate initialing — correctly implementing federal and state requirements.
- **Encryption preference**: The form asks whether patients want records encrypted, a privacy-conscious option rarely seen on ROI forms.
- **No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature.

## Overall Assessment

Coast Plaza Hospital provides a findable, reasonably organized generic ROI form that a patient *can* use for self-access, but the experience is clearly not designed around patient needs. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, CD-only electronic delivery, and generic third-party framing all reflect a process built for institutional convenience rather than patient empowerment. The form earns credit for easy findability, granular record selection, and proper handling of sensitive categories, but falls short on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness.

# Sturdy Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Sturdy Memorial Hospital (Attleboro, MA) publishes two PDF authorization forms on its website, both titled "Authorization to Release Health Information." Form-1 (updated January 2025, form code SM00081 10/24) is the current, actively maintained version — a 2-page fillable PDF with 59 interactive fields. Form-2 is an older (~2017) legacy version of the same document with zero fillable fields, outdated terminology ("Venereal Disease"), and defunct department references. Form-2 remains publicly accessible, creating a risk that patients download the wrong version. There is no redirect, banner, or other mechanism steering patients to the current form.

No online portal, patient portal integration, or third-party vendor (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was identified for records requests. The only documented pathway is downloading and completing the PDF authorization form, then submitting it — presumably by mail or fax, though the form itself does not specify a submission method. The hospital's mailing address (211 Park Street, PO Box 2963, Attleboro, MA 02703-0963) is listed in the revocation instructions.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Sturdy Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both form versions are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms structured around a three-party model: the patient authorizes Provider A to release records to Provider B. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in the "Release of Protected Health Information To" field — an unintuitive workaround that the form does not explain. The "Purpose of Disclosure" checkboxes include "Personal," the closest match for self-access, but this option is neither highlighted nor explained. The form does not reference the patient's HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), nor does it mention the right to inspect or obtain copies of one's own records as a distinct use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search immediately surfaced both PDFs as direct links on sturdyhealth.org. No website navigation was needed. However, Akamai CDN bot protection blocked programmatic downloads (curl returned "Access Denied"), requiring a browser-based JavaScript workaround to retrieve the raw PDF bytes. This would not affect a typical patient using a web browser but could impede assistive-technology or API-based access.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

The current form is a standout in technical execution. With 59 fillable fields, it is comprehensively interactive — patients can complete the entire form electronically without printing. The PDF is a native digital document (no scanned images, full text layer, 221 KB file size). The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → authorization source/recipient → sensitive information categories → purpose of disclosure → record types → rights → signature. The form uses clear section organization across its 2 pages.

Language is mixed: the rights section uses accessible plain English ("I may refuse to sign this authorization and that such refusal will not affect my health care"), while the sensitive information and disclosure sections are more legalistic. No plain-language summary or introductory guidance is provided. The form is English-only.

Record-type granularity is a notable strength — approximately 14 categories with individual date-range fields (medical record abstract, clinic visit notes, emergency room, lab reports, radiology, pathology, operative reports, etc.), giving patients meaningful control over scope. Sensitive information categories (mental health, HIV/AIDS, STD, sexual assault, substance abuse, genetic testing) require individual initials, respecting Massachusetts law and patient autonomy.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **90-day hard expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signature, with no option to specify a custom date (the older form-2 allowed this). Given HIPAA's 30-day processing window with a possible 30-day extension, this leaves a narrow margin.
- **Ambiguous witness requirement**: A "WITNESS" line appears at the bottom of page 2 with no instructions on whether a witness is required. Patients may unnecessarily delay submission while seeking a witness.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs for records copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No electronic delivery option**: No checkbox for email, portal, or electronic format delivery of the requested records.

## Bright Spots

- **59 fillable fields** — exceptional among ROI forms, most of which have zero interactive fields. Clearly a deliberate digital-first design decision.
- **Granular record-type selection** with ~14 categories and date ranges.
- **Individual sensitive-information consent** via initials for each category.
- **Active form maintenance** — the January 2025 update shows ongoing attention.
- **No notarization requirement**, no consent bundling, and clear right-to-refuse language.

## Overall Assessment

Sturdy Memorial Hospital delivers a technically excellent form that falls short on patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF with granular record selection is among the best form documents in its class, but the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway means patients must navigate a third-party release form to exercise their Right of Access. The form's structure, language, and field design all orient toward provider-to-provider or provider-to-insurer disclosure rather than patient self-access. Combined with ambiguities around witness requirements, submission methods, and a restrictive expiration, the experience is functional but not patient-centered.

# Synthesis: Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix

## Overview

Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix is part of Banner Health, a major nonprofit health system in the western United States. The facility uses Banner Health's system-wide forms for medical records release rather than maintaining its own. Two forms were found: a current system-wide authorization (form-1.pdf, revised 06/2025) and a legacy hospital-specific version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/2017). The current system-wide form is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Banner Health offers two pathways for record access: a downloadable PDF authorization form and a patient portal (Banner Health App / https://account.bannerhealth.com/). The current form (form-1.pdf) prominently notes at the top that patients can access most health information through the portal, which is a helpful redirect before a patient commits to the paper process. For records not available through the portal, the PDF form is the primary pathway. Submission options include mail, fax, and in-person pick-up — fax provides an adequate electronic submission method, though there is no online form submission or email-based submission option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Banner Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" documents designed to cover all release scenarios. The current form includes a "Self" checkbox under both the "Release/Send Information To" field and the "Purpose" field, acknowledging that patients may request their own records, but the form structure, language, and authorization requirements are identical regardless of who the records are going to. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same release-from/release-to paradigm, date range fields, record type checkboxes, and HIPAA authorization language that a third party would face. There is no simplified patient access request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A straightforward web search returned the system-wide form immediately, and it is published on bannerhealth.com under the patients/medical-records section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA was encountered. Both forms were directly downloadable via curl. The coexistence of the current (2025) and legacy (2017) forms on the same website creates a minor risk that patients might download the outdated version, which lacks the portal callout and has less granular sensitive-information controls.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a flat, non-fillable PDF — zero interactive form fields despite being a born-digital document. A patient must print the form, handwrite all fields, sign it, and submit via mail, fax, or in-person. The form is 2 pages with approximately 20 fields to complete (patient demographics, release from/to addresses, date range, record type checkboxes, delivery preference, purpose, and signature). The layout is logically organized with clear section headers and a natural top-to-bottom flow. Record-type selection is granular with 12 specific categories plus an "Other" option.

Language is mixed: the opening paragraph about "third-party directives" is dense regulatory jargon that would confuse most patients, but the authorization statements on page 2 use accessible "I understand" framing. The sensitive information section uses an exclusion model — all sensitive data is included by default, with checkboxes to opt specific categories out. This is more protective than the legacy form's blanket consent but may still surprise patients who don't realize they must affirmatively opt out.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: The form warns "There may be a FEE associated with your Request for Records" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access fees (capped under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. This vagueness may deter patients from making requests.

**Liability waiver**: The form includes a broad release of Banner Health from "any legal responsibility or liability for the disclosure" — a clause that goes beyond standard HIPAA authorization requirements.

**No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature (or legal representative), which is appropriate.

**No in-person requirement**: Fax submission is available, so patients are not forced to visit the facility.

## Strengths

- **Patient portal callout**: The prominent opening line directing patients to the portal is a best practice that may eliminate the need for the paper form entirely for many patients.
- **Recent revision**: The 06/2025 revision date demonstrates active form maintenance.
- **Granular record selection**: 12 specific record categories give patients meaningful control.
- **Sensitive information opt-out**: Per-category exclusion checkboxes improve on the blanket consent approach.
- **Clear patient rights language**: Explicit statements about the right to refuse, non-conditioning of treatment, and right to revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Banner Health provides a findable, recently maintained, and reasonably well-designed authorization form, but it falls short of a truly patient-centered experience. The form funnels all requests — self-access and third-party — through the same generic authorization, the PDF is not fillable, and the fee disclosure is vague. The patient portal redirect is a genuine bright spot, but for patients who need the paper form, the experience is a standard paper-based workflow with no digital-first innovation. The organization earns credit for accessibility and active maintenance but loses ground on technical modernization and pathway differentiation.

# Erie Family Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erie Family Health Centers, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Chicago, provides two downloaded ROI forms: an English version (form-1.pdf) and a Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are identical in structure — a single-page "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form. The organization also directs patients to MyChart (myeriehealth.com) as the primary records access pathway, referenced on a dedicated medical records request page at `/recordsrequest/`.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Erie does **not** offer a dedicated patient-access form. Both downloaded forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for bidirectional use: releasing records *to* a third party or receiving records *from* a third party. A patient requesting their own records must select "to Release to" and write their own name and address in the recipient fields — a process designed for inter-provider transfers, not individual access. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under the purpose section, which accommodates self-requests but does not differentiate the pathway. There is no separate, simplified form for patients exercising their Right of Access under § 164.524.

That said, the records request page promotes MyChart as the primary way to access records, which provides a true patient-access pathway. The PDF form functions as a secondary or fallback option.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search for "Erie Family Health Centers medical records release form PDF" returned the direct URL. The organization maintains a clearly labeled `/recordsrequest/` page that links both English and Spanish PDFs and also promotes MyChart. No bot blocking, login walls, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with **54 fillable fields**. It was designed for digital completion, not a scan. However, field names are not programmatically labeled (empty `fillable_field_names` array), which impairs screen reader accessibility. The layout is logically organized — patient identification, authorization direction, purpose, format, delivery method, record types, date range, sensitive-category permissions, rights statement, and signature — all on one dense page.

The language is reasonably clear for an authorization form, though the legal disclaimers at the bottom (addressing re-disclosure restrictions under Illinois mental health, substance abuse, and AIDS confidentiality laws) are dense and directed at the receiving party rather than the patient. The reference to "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" is cryptic — no pay scale is provided or linked, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs.

Format options include paper copy or "Electronic copy (CD-ROM)" — the CD-ROM reference is outdated. Delivery methods include encrypted email, pickup at an Erie facility, fax, and US postal mail. Encrypted email is a notable modern inclusion.

## Barriers

- **Copy of ID required** as a blanket requirement, with no alternative verification methods offered. For an FQHC serving populations that may lack government-issued ID, this exceeds what HIPAA mandates for identity verification.
- **Witness signature line** present with no indication of whether it is required or optional, potentially creating an unnecessary procedural barrier.
- **Fee opacity**: "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" references an undisclosed fee schedule. Patients cannot learn costs before submitting.
- **No notarization** required. No in-person submission requirement. Auto-expiration at six months is reasonable.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both English and Spanish versions are provided and linked side-by-side — appropriate and commendable for a Chicago FQHC.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: A modern, patient-friendly option that many organizations omit.
- **Dedicated records request page**: Clear `/recordsrequest/` page contextualizes forms and promotes MyChart as an alternative.
- **Granular record selection**: Nine specific record categories plus "Other" let patients request exactly what they need.
- **MyChart availability**: The patient portal provides a true digital-first access pathway beyond the PDF form.

## Overall Assessment

Erie Family Health Centers earns a **B grade** (3.70 weighted score). The organization makes its forms easy to find, offers bilingual versions, provides a fillable PDF with modern delivery options including encrypted email, and maintains a dedicated records page. These are genuine strengths, especially for an independent FQHC. However, the lack of a dedicated patient-access pathway (funneling all requestors through a generic third-party authorization form), the undisclosed fee schedule, the blanket ID copy requirement, and the ambiguous witness signature line prevent a higher score. The MyChart portal partially compensates by offering patients a true self-service pathway, but the PDF form itself — the focus of this evaluation — treats patient self-access as just another use case rather than a first-class right.

# Synthesis: Essentia Health-Fosston

## Overview

Essentia Health-Fosston is a critical access hospital in Fosston, MN, part of the regional nonprofit Essentia Health system. The facility does not maintain its own medical records forms; it uses system-wide Essentia Health documents for all records-related processes. Four documents were retrieved, but only one — the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (form-1, EH10843 12/25) — is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records. The other three documents serve adjacent purposes: MyChart portal enrollment (form-2), MyChart proxy access delegation (form-3), and verbal information-sharing authorization (form-4).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Essentia Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting records on behalf of someone else. Form-1 is a general-purpose authorization with "From" and "To" fields designed for transferring records between entities. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both fields — putting themselves as the recipient — and check "Personal use" as the reason. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and no tailored instructions for self-access requests. That said, Essentia Health does offer meaningful alternatives: the medical records page directs patients to **MyChart** as the primary access pathway and provides a **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** as a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link, and Essentia Health's medical records page (`essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`) is well-organized with clearly labeled download links. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was required. The URL structure is clean and descriptive. All forms are hosted on the main Essentia Health domain (except the MyChart-related forms on `essentiamychart.org`).

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page**, digitally-designed PDF with a complete text layer — impressively compact for the scope it covers. The layout follows a logical flow from patient demographics through release details, record type selection, delivery method, and legal notices. The form offers strong record type granularity with 18+ individual checkboxes plus an "All Routine Records" shortcut, and appropriately separates behavioral health and substance use disorder records with distinct opt-in/opt-out controls.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally composed. All data entry uses blank underscores, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a consistent pattern across all four Essentia Health forms and appears to be a deliberate system-wide design choice rather than a per-form oversight. The delivery method options are a bright spot: patients can receive records via MyChart, email, fax, or mail (paper or disc).

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unusual barriers — no notarization, no witness requirement (except for mark-based signatures), no in-person-only submission. Submission is available via email, fax, or mail. Fee language is vague: "I may be required to pay a fee for retrieval and photocopying of records," citing state statutes rather than HIPAA cost-based fee limits, with no specific amounts disclosed. The form properly includes anti-conditioning language, revocation rights, psychotherapy note protections, and 42 CFR Part 2 SUD protections. One notable issue: the MyChart enrollment forms (form-2, form-3) collect partial SSN, which is unnecessary for portal access and creates data minimization concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** provides a fully digital alternative pathway
- **Single-page form** — remarkably compact for comprehensive ROI coverage
- **Electronic delivery options** including email and MyChart — not just fax/mail
- **Multi-state legal compliance** across MN, WI, and ND
- **Recently revised** (December 2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Well-organized medical records page** with clear navigation and multiple pathway options

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization
- **Zero fillable fields** across all four system forms — entirely print-and-handwrite
- **Vague fee disclosure** with no specific amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee reference
- **Form-3 (MyChart proxy)** published as a proof copy with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers
- **Behavioral health opt-out vs. SUD opt-in** inconsistency may confuse patients

## Overall Assessment

Essentia Health-Fosston earns a **B grade**. The organization benefits from its parent system's well-organized web presence, a compact and recently-updated authorization form, and the availability of a digital request portal. The main limitations are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients must use a generic third-party authorization form) and the absence of fillable fields on any PDF form. The Swellbox portal partially compensates for the PDF's technical shortcomings, and the multiple electronic submission and delivery options keep the process accessible. A patient can successfully request their records without visiting the facility, but the process isn't designed around them.

# Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center: Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system, offers patients three distinct pathways to request medical records: **MyChart** (patient portal), **eRequest** (an online wizard powered by Swellbox/Datavant at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html), and a **downloadable paper form**. Fax (513-599-4503), email (MercyROI@datavant.com), and phone (844-835-1238) are also listed as contact channels for Springfield.

Four PDF documents were retrieved, but only two are relevant to Springfield patients. **Form-1** is from mercy.net (a separate Missouri-based Mercy system)—a false positive caused by the confusingly similar branding. **Form-2** is a Youngstown-region variant from the correct system but wrong region. **Form-3** is the system-wide authorization form currently linked on the website, but it is an **image-only scan** with only 46 characters of extractable text—functionally inaccessible to screen readers or digital filling. **Form-4** (MHP 0785 Rev 1/19) is the Springfield-specific authorization form with full text layer, but it is **not linked anywhere on the website**—it was discovered only by guessing the URL pattern (`mercy.com/-/media/.../springfield.ashx`).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. All PDF forms are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information"—generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release. Form-4 accommodates patient self-access via a "Self" checkbox and defaults the purpose to "For Personal use if not otherwise stated," which is patient-friendly. However, the form structure, title, and legal framing are oriented toward third-party authorization. A dedicated patient access request form (like the one from the Missouri mercy.net system, ironically) does not exist within Bon Secours Mercy Health's offerings for Springfield.

The eRequest portal via Swellbox/Datavant represents a potentially more patient-centric pathway, as it is an online records request wizard that may differentiate between request types. However, only the PDF forms were directly evaluated.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page was straightforward—`mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests` is well-organized with clear pathways. However, finding the **right PDF form** for Springfield was surprisingly difficult. The linked system-wide form (form-3) is an image-only scan—a 2024 regression from the 2019 text-based regional versions. The Springfield-specific text version exists at a predictable URL but is entirely undiscoverable through normal website navigation. Additionally, web searches conflated mercy.com (Ohio) with mercy.net (Missouri), producing a false-positive form from the wrong health system.

## Form Document Quality (Form-4, the Best Available PDF)

Form-4 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a full text layer—but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it requires printing and hand-filling. The layout is logical: patient demographics → facility selection → date range → record types (11 checkboxes) → recipient → format → delivery → legal disclosures → signature. The top half is clear and well-organized; the bottom half compresses six dense legal bullet points into small paragraphs with complex language ("Treatment, Operations or Payment disclosures to insurance companies when the law gives the right to the insurers to contest a claim under policy"). The form cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and offers four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email) with electronic format (PDF/CD) as the default—an uncommon patient-friendly choice.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable concerns emerge. First, **"Photo ID required at the time of request"** is stated in the header with no guidance on how this applies to fax or mail submissions, creating ambiguity that could deter remote requests. Second, **"Entire record (standard two years of information, unless otherwise specified)"** imposes a default time limitation that patients may not notice, potentially resulting in incomplete records when HIPAA's Right of Access covers the entire designated record set. Fee language is vague: "There may be a charge for copies of records" with no amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee distinction. No notarization is required, and multiple electronic submission methods are available (fax, email).

## Notable Strengths

The organization offers a genuinely multi-channel approach: MyChart, Swellbox/Datavant eRequest portal, and paper form with fax/email/mail submission. The electronic format default, personal-use default purpose, explicit § 164.524 reference, and MyChart delivery option are all bright spots. The form is available in English only—no multilingual versions were found for Springfield.

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center provides an **adequate but fragmented** patient records request experience. The eRequest portal and MyChart offer digital pathways, but the downloadable form—the fallback option—suffers from critical problems: the linked version is an image-only scan, the better text version is hidden, no forms have fillable fields, and the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access instrument. The result is a C-grade experience where digitally-savvy patients who find the portal do fine, but patients seeking a traditional form encounter unnecessary friction.

# The Iowa Clinic — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

The Iowa Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in West Des Moines, Iowa. Notably, the organization has fully transitioned away from downloadable PDF authorization forms: all medical records requests are now handled through third-party online platforms. The two PDF forms evaluated (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf) were retrieved exclusively from the Wayback Machine and date from approximately 2012–2015. They are no longer available on the live website.

## Available Pathways and Current State

The Iowa Clinic's medical records page (https://www.iowaclinic.com/for-patients/payment-billing/medical-records/) routes patients through four distinct channels depending on who is requesting records:

1. **Patient self-requests**: Datavant/Swellbox Health Record Wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/iowa-clinic-wizard.html) — an online portal for patients to request their own records.
2. **Imaging records**: A Formstack-powered web form on the Iowa Clinic website.
3. **Healthcare providers**: A separate Swellbox wizard.
4. **Third-party organizations**: SmartRequest portal (https://smartrequest.com).

This multi-channel architecture is the most relevant finding: The Iowa Clinic **does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release** at the website level, routing patients to a dedicated Swellbox wizard while directing third-party organizations to a separate SmartRequest portal. This structural separation is a meaningful strength.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page itself was straightforward — it's accessible under For Patients > Payment & Billing > Medical Records. However, finding downloadable PDF forms required significant effort since none exist on the current site. The PDFs were only recoverable through Wayback Machine archive searches of defunct URLs (`/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf` and `/static/docs/medical-records-release-form.pdf`). No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Historical Form Quality (form-1.pdf — Primary Evaluated Form)

Form-1.pdf is the newer of the two historical forms — a single-page "Authorization for Release of Information" with a clean digital layout (not a scan), text layer present, but **zero fillable fields**. It would require printing and handwriting. The form has approximately 15 fields including patient demographics, record-type checkboxes (8 options), destination address, purpose of release (6 options plus "Other"), sensitive-information opt-out initials, and signature. The layout follows a logical flow and fits everything on one page without excessive cramming.

The language is a mix of plain and semi-legal. Disclosure paragraphs are readable but contain some dense constructions. The form includes a "Request by patient" purpose option, which is a bright spot — acknowledging patient-initiated access even within a form designed primarily for third-party release. Submission was by fax (515-875-9600) or mail only.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection**: Both forms request Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The electronic transmission clause shifts all liability for misdirected fax/email to the patient, which is an overreach.
- **Fees**: The forms mention a "cost-based fee" without specifying amounts — compliant language but leaves patients unable to anticipate costs.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax and mail were offered as submission methods on the historical forms; the current online portal eliminates even these steps.

## Notable Strengths

The Iowa Clinic's most significant strength is its forward-looking transition to a fully digital, portal-based workflow. By routing patient requests through Swellbox/Datavant — a purpose-built health records request platform — the organization has eliminated the print-fill-fax cycle entirely for patients with internet access. The website's clear separation of patient requests from third-party requests demonstrates awareness of the distinction between individual access rights and authorization-based release.

## Overall Assessment

The Iowa Clinic presents a bifurcated picture. Its **current state** is strong: the organization has modernized beyond PDF forms to online portals with clear pathway differentiation. However, the **historical forms** we could directly evaluate were generic ROI authorization forms with no fillable fields, SSN collection, and liability waivers. Scoring reflects the best available current pathway (the Swellbox portal) while noting that the only downloadable form documents available for detailed quality assessment are from 2012–2015 and no longer represent the patient experience. For a patient requesting their own records today, The Iowa Clinic offers a patient-centered, digitally accessible process.

# Advocare, LLC — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Advocare, LLC provides three downloaded authorization forms and an online submission alternative:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): The current English-language "Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information," a 2-page fillable PDF with 41 interactive fields, revised January 2026. Linked directly from the official medical records page.
- **form-3.pdf**: A Spanish-language translation of the same authorization form, dated January 2024, with 44 fillable fields. Also linked from the medical records page.
- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An older single-page version (v2, April 2021) found on a different CDN path, likely from an individual practice sub-site. It has zero fillable fields and includes a Social Security Number field that the current version removed.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, Advocare's medical records page offers an **online request option via ShareCare** and a separate third-party requester portal. The PDF forms list mail and email as delivery options, and fax is implicitly available through their practice offices.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocare does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release. All three PDF forms are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for disclosure to third parties. However, form-2 includes a **"Patient Request" checkbox** under the purpose field, acknowledging patient-initiated requests. The structural awkwardness remains: a patient requesting their own records must still fill out "recipient" fields, essentially listing themselves as the party receiving disclosure. This is a common industry pattern but reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-access-first design.

The ShareCare online portal provides an alternative pathway, though it was not evaluated as a downloaded form in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Advocare's forms was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page, which clearly links to downloadable PDFs in English and Spanish, the ShareCare online portal, and a third-party requester portal. No bot blocking, authentication, or browser workarounds were needed. The only minor issue is that the legacy form-1.pdf remains discoverable via web search, creating a risk that patients could find and submit an outdated document.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2.pdf is a **born-digital, fillable PDF** with 41 interactive fields — a significant improvement over the legacy form-1 (which had zero fillable fields). The layout follows a logical flow: patient demographics → sending/receiving provider → purpose → date range → record types → sensitive categories → attestation → signature. The two-column sender/recipient layout is efficient, and the form includes 12 record-type checkboxes plus an "Abstract Record" shortcut (last year of encounters and results).

The language is a mix of standard HIPAA authorization phrasing and reasonably clear instructions. While not truly plain-language, it is accessible to most adults. One notable defect: the PDF contains a duplicated/garbled heading ("Select from thethe following...") — a layout error. The fillable fields also lack accessible names, which would impact screen reader users.

The Spanish version (form-3) is a high-quality professional translation with fillable fields, though it lacks the email delivery option present in the English form — a functional parity gap.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **No in-person submission requirement** — mail, email, and online (ShareCare) are available.
- **No fees disclosed** on the form — neither good nor bad, but not transparent.
- **No SSN field** on the current form (the legacy form-1 did collect SSN — a red flag that was corrected).
- **90-day default expiration** is shorter than the industry-typical 6 months, potentially requiring re-authorization if processing is slow.
- **30-day response timeline** is clearly stated, correctly reflecting HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering a professionally translated Spanish form alongside English is uncommon and valuable, especially in a Northeast practice.
- **"Abstract Record" option**: Provides a practical shortcut for patients who want a summary without selecting individual record types.
- **Reference Guide**: Page 2 defines sensitive information categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, reproductive services) in plain language with NJ law citations.
- **Email delivery option**: Explicitly offers electronic delivery alongside mail.
- **Online submission via ShareCare**: Provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Overall Assessment

Advocare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an independent physician practice. Forms are easy to find, fillable, available in two languages, and offer electronic submission. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must navigate a general-purpose authorization form designed around third-party disclosure. The "Patient Request" checkbox partially addresses this, but the form's structure still assumes a sender-to-recipient model that doesn't map cleanly to individual access rights. This is a solid B-level performance: competent, accessible, and showing genuine attention to patient needs, with room for improvement in truly centering the patient access experience.

# University of Mississippi Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

UMMC provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (Form #1862) in two language versions. Form-1 is a Spanish-language version (Rev. 05/2025) retrieved from the Wayback Machine, and form-2 is an older English-language version (Rev. 04/2018) obtained from a third-party caching site (pdf4pro.com). Both are one-page PDFs covering all UMMC locations. No dedicated patient access form, online portal, or web-based request wizard was identified. No separate fee schedule or patient rights document was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UMMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to third parties — the "Release to" field and purpose options like Legal/Attorney, Insurance, and Workers' Compensation reflect a third-party orientation. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal" as the purpose and enter their own contact information in the "Release to" field, which is a confusing and unintuitive workflow. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or informs patients of their affirmative right to access their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **extremely difficult**. The English PDF link on UMMC's website returns HTTP 404, and an older compliance-page URL is also broken. Five different retrieval strategies were attempted: direct web search, curl (failed due to DNS), Wayback Machine, browser-based archive navigation, and finally a third-party cache. The Spanish version was the only form still live at its canonical URL. The English form was only available via pdf4pro.com — a source no typical patient would find. This represents a critical findability failure for a major teaching hospital: a patient visiting the UMMC website today and clicking the Release Form link reaches a dead end.

## Form Document Quality

Using the **high-watermark principle**, the Spanish form (form-1) is the better document: it has 70 fillable/interactive fields, a native text layer, and was clearly designed as a digital-first PDF. The English form (form-2) has zero fillable fields and requires printing and handwriting. Both forms share identical structure: location selection → patient info → release-to info → purpose checkboxes → 14 record-type checkboxes → sensitive information initials → patient rights paragraph → signature block with witness. The layout is logically organized but cramped, fitting everything onto a single page at the cost of readability. The Patient Rights section is a dense, unbroken paragraph of legal text with no bullet points or visual hierarchy. Three delivery formats are offered — Paper, Electronic, and "View Access as scheduled" — but none are defined, and critically, **no submission instructions appear on either form** (no fax number, no mailing address for initial submission, no email, no portal link).

## Barriers

- **Witness signature required**: Both forms mandate a witness, which HIPAA does not require. This is a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **SSN collection**: Both forms request the patient's full Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates identity theft risk.
- **Incomplete forms rejected**: The header warns that incomplete forms will not be accepted, but does not clarify which fields are mandatory.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions fees, costs, or the patient's right to cost-based pricing.
- **No submission instructions**: A patient completing the form has no way to know where to send it.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering Spanish and English versions is a genuine accessibility strength, especially for Mississippi's growing Spanish-speaking population.
- **Fillable PDF (Spanish version)**: 70 interactive fields allow digital completion.
- **Electronic delivery option**: The form explicitly offers "Electronic" as a delivery format.
- **Granular record selection**: 14 specific record categories with a clarification that "Entire Medical Record" does not include images — a helpful transparency measure.
- **"Personal" purpose option**: Including this among pre-printed options legitimizes patient self-access.

## Overall Assessment

UMMC provides a generic, moderately well-designed authorization form that serves patients as an afterthought rather than a primary audience. The critical findability failure — a broken English PDF link on the organization's own website — is the most acute problem: a patient cannot currently obtain the form from UMMC online. The Spanish version survives but would not serve most English-speaking patients. The witness requirement and SSN collection add unnecessary friction. The absence of submission instructions is a significant gap. While the Spanish form's fillable fields and bilingual availability are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects an organization that has not prioritized patient self-access as a distinct use case.

# Prevea Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Prevea Health is an independent nonprofit physician practice based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It offers a single authorization form — an "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (PRV_839, rev. 0118) — as its primary mechanism for patients to request their own medical records. The same form is available in four languages: English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. No separate patient access–specific form or online portal was identified.

## Access Pathway

Prevea Health uses a **generic HIPAA authorization form** rather than a dedicated patient access form. However, the form explicitly accommodates patient self-requests: Section 3 ("To Disclose To") includes a "Self" checkbox with delivery options (pick up, mail, on-site viewing, electronic format, and email with encrypted/unencrypted options). Section 7 ("Purpose") includes "Patient Request" as a named checkbox option. While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, the form clearly signals that patients can use it for their own records — placing it above average among generic authorization forms.

The form does not differentiate the legal basis for patient self-access (HIPAA § 164.524) from third-party release (§ 164.508), but the practical workflow is reasonably clear for a patient who wants their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and the form is directly linked from the Patient Forms and Documents > Medical Records page at prevea.com. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was encountered. The URL is descriptive. This is a model for how organizations should make forms accessible.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally-created PDF** — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. A patient must print and hand-fill the form (or annotate it in a PDF viewer). This is the form's most significant technical limitation. The layout is logically organized into nine numbered sections with clear headings, and the single-page format keeps things concise. However, the density required to fit everything onto one page makes the rights section (Section 8) extremely cramped and difficult to read.

Section 8 is the form's weakest content area: a ~200-word paragraph of dense legalese with complex nested clauses that would challenge most patients. The rest of the form uses reasonably plain language with clearly labeled fields and checkbox options.

The form provides granular record-type selection (12 categories plus a free-text field) and includes opt-out checkboxes for sensitive information (alcohol/drug abuse, HIV results, mental health) consistent with Wisconsin law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Barriers

- **No notarization required.** Witness signature is needed only for AODA/Mental Health disclosures, consistent with legal requirements.
- **Fees:** The form states "copy fees may apply" but does not disclose specific amounts — neutral but not fully transparent.
- **Date range default:** If left blank, only records from the past two years are disclosed. This restrictive default is a notable red flag — patients seeking complete records must affirmatively specify a date range, which is unintuitive.
- **Submission instructions absent:** The form provides no guidance on where or how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, mailing address, or email for the HIM department. A patient who downloads and completes the form has no clear next step.
- **Minor errors:** "42 CRF" (should be CFR) and "e-email" (doubled prefix) suggest limited quality review.
- **HSHS references:** The form references "HSHS" (Hospital Sisters Health System) without explanation, which may confuse patients who know only Prevea Health.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — rare among physician practices and reflective of local demographics.
- **Five delivery options** including electronic format and email with encrypted/unencrypted distinction — well above average.
- **Explicit self-request pathway** via the "Self" checkbox and "Patient Request" purpose option.

## Overall Assessment

Prevea Health provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience with genuine accessibility strengths (multilingual forms, electronic delivery options, easy findability). The primary weaknesses are the non-fillable PDF format, missing submission instructions, a restrictive date range default, and dense legalese in the rights section. The form serves patients adequately but falls short of best-in-class due to its paper-oriented workflow and the absence of submission guidance.
