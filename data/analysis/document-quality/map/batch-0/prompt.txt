# St. Charles Redmond — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

St. Charles Redmond is part of the St. Charles Health System, a nonprofit regional system operating four hospitals across Central Oregon (Bend, Redmond, Madras, Prineville). The system uses a single, unified ROI authorization form across all locations — there is no Redmond-specific form. Four PDF documents were retrieved: a legacy 2016 non-fillable version (form-1), a superseded 2022 fillable version (form-2), the current 2025 English fillable version (form-3), and the current 2025 Spanish fillable version (form-4). The primary form for assessment is **form-3.pdf**, the current English authorization form linked from the website.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

St. Charles does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All records requests — whether a patient seeking their own records or a third party requesting disclosure — are routed through the same "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. A patient requesting their own records checks "Personal" under the purpose field, but the form's From/To structure, designed to handle bidirectional provider-to-provider transfers, is unintuitive for simple self-access. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and the form uses an authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than an access-request framework — a meaningful distinction that affects fee limits and processing timelines.

The website's release-of-information page does distinguish between self-requests and third-party requests in its instructions, and notes that patients can alternatively use **MyChart** for records from April 7, 2018 onward. This patient portal pathway offers a fully digital alternative, though it is limited to records after the system's EHR transition date.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the St. Charles ROI page, which is clearly linked under the Patients section. Both English and Spanish PDF links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor issue was that legacy form URLs remain accessible on the server, meaning a search engine could direct patients to an outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a well-constructed 2-page fillable PDF with **65 interactive fields** covering all data-entry points. This is a genuinely usable digital document — patients can type their responses on-screen. The form uses a numbered section system (1–10) with matching instructions at the bottom of each page, a thoughtful design pattern. Record-type options are granular, with parenthetical descriptions explaining what each category includes. Plain-language parentheticals gloss legal concepts (e.g., "revoke (take back or change my mind about)").

However, the layout is dense, and the dual From/To sections (3 and 4) have **identical instruction text**, creating confusion about which section applies to whom. The CORA radiology contact information adds operational clutter. The form collects approximately 15–20 patient-facing fields (demographics, purpose, locations, record types, date range, sensitive-records initials, format/delivery, and signature).

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the **wet-ink signature requirement** — the form explicitly states "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED," preventing electronic signatures and forcing patients to print the form after filling it digitally. The submission pathway then requires faxing (HIM fax number is listed in the footer: 541-706-6352) or mailing to the Bend HIM office. Fax submission is available, satisfying the electronic submission threshold, but the print-sign-fax workflow is cumbersome.

Fees are mentioned twice ("Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations") but never quantified, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. No fee schedule is referenced. The form does not distinguish between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's cost-based limits) and third-party release fees.

No notarization is required. A photo ID check appears in the office-use section but is not presented as a patient-facing barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Full Spanish translation (form-4) with 65 fillable fields — genuinely uncommon and meaningful for Central Oregon's community.
- **Iterative improvement**: The progression from flat PDF (2016) to 64-field fillable (2022) to 65-field fillable (2025) shows active form maintenance.
- **System-wide form with location checkboxes**: Simplifies multi-location requests within the St. Charles system.
- **MyChart alternative**: Provides a fully digital pathway for post-2018 records.

## Overall Assessment

St. Charles Redmond provides a competent but undifferentiated records-request process. The form itself is technically well-made — fillable, bilingual, well-organized — but it funnels patients through a generic authorization framework that wasn't designed for individual access. The wet-ink signature requirement undermines the otherwise digital-friendly form design, and the lack of fee transparency or Right of Access language represents missed opportunities. The MyChart alternative partially compensates but doesn't cover the full record history. Overall, this is a **C-grade** experience: functional and findable, but not patient-centered.

# Fisher-Titus Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fisher-Titus Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Norwalk, Ohio. Three documents were downloaded from the organization's website: two versions of the same "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form (form-1.pdf revised 11/2024 and form-3.pdf revised 07/2025, both carrying form number FTC24-5) and an unrelated Emergency Medical Authorization form (form-2.pdf) for minor children. The relevant documents for patient self-access are the two ROI authorization forms, with form-3.pdf being the more current revision.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient Self-Access Accommodation

Fisher-Titus does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. Instead, it provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form that serves all release-of-information purposes — patient self-access, third-party releases to attorneys, insurers, and other providers alike. However, the form includes a notable accommodation: a **"Self (same info as above)" checkbox** in the recipient section (Section 2), which explicitly lets patients indicate they are requesting their own records without having to fill out a separate recipient name and address. A "Personal" purpose option in Section 4 further supports this use case.

Despite these accommodations, the form's framing — titled "Authorization to Disclose PHI" — and its overall design orient around third-party disclosure. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access, no plain-language explanation of patient rights, and no guidance distinguishing the patient self-access process from a third-party release. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different primary audience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. It is reachable within two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Guests → Patient Forms) and is also available on a dedicated Medical Records page (/medical-records). No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-rendered links were encountered. URLs are descriptively named. The two independent navigation paths to the form are above average for a community hospital. One confusing element: the Patient Forms page links to the older revision (form-1.pdf) while the Medical Records page links to the newer revision (form-3.pdf), with no indication to the patient which version is current.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-3.pdf, revised 07/2025) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with extractable text. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as typographic underscores, and checkboxes are non-interactive Unicode characters. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand or use a PDF annotation tool. This is a print-first design distributed digitally.

The form's structure is well-organized with **eight clearly numbered sections** following a logical progression: patient info → recipient → treatment location → purpose → record types → format/delivery → sensitive information consent → expiration/signature. Section 5 provides impressively granular record selection with approximately 17 specific record type checkboxes (discharge summaries, H&P, operative reports, lab, pathology, radiology images, immunizations, ED records, etc.), each with date fields. Patients can request their entire record or specific items.

The language is **moderately clear** — section headers are descriptive and the flow is intuitive, but legal boilerplate in Sections 7 and 8 uses complex sentence structures typical of authorization forms. A patient of average literacy could complete the form, though the dense Section 5 and legal consent language may slow them down. Approximately 20–25 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN requested**: Section 1 asks for "SS#" (Social Security Number), which is unnecessary for patient access under HIPAA and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Witness Signature" line appears at the bottom with no explanation of when or whether a witness is required, potentially deterring patients who lack a convenient witness.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: The form states Fisher-Titus "may charge a fee" but provides no fee schedule, amounts, or indication of whether patient self-access requests are free.
- **Two conflicting versions online**: The older and newer revisions differ in content (sensitive information categories, specialty office listings) but share the same form number, risking patient confusion.

## Bright Spots

- **Encrypted email as a delivery format**: Fisher-Titus offers encrypted email alongside CD, flash drive, and paper for records delivery — a progressive option for a community hospital.
- **Granular record selection**: The 17+ record type checkboxes with date fields give patients fine-grained control over their request scope.
- **"Self" checkbox**: The explicit self-request accommodation, while not a dedicated patient form, reduces friction compared to forms that only contemplate third-party recipients.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Fax numbers are listed for each treatment location, and mail and in-person options are available — ensuring patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fisher-Titus Medical Center provides an accessible, reasonably well-designed records request process hampered by a print-only form design and a generic authorization framework that does not truly center patient self-access. The form is easy to find, logically organized, and offers progressive delivery options including encrypted email. However, the lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of patient rights language or fee transparency pull the overall experience down. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience with that patient in mind as the primary audience.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MUSC Health University Medical Center in Charleston, SC is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina health system. The organization provides three pathways for patients to request their medical records: a downloadable PDF authorization form, MyChart patient portal, and an online Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool. Three documents were retrieved: the English authorization form (form-1), a MyChart instructional guide (form-2), and a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway Assessment

MUSC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary pathway is a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form that serves both patient access and third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same "Release Records From" / "Release Records To" framework designed for third-party disclosures, filling in their own name as both patient and recipient — an unintuitive experience. The form includes "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" as one of eight purpose-of-release checkboxes, but patient self-access is not called out as a distinct pathway.

However, MUSC partially compensates by offering the MyChart portal pathway, where patients can submit records requests electronically. The MyChart guide (form-2) describes a step-by-step process for requesting records within the portal, though it prominently warns about fees and a prepayment requirement. The Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool is a third option but requires webcam identity verification, adding friction.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A standard web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL at a clean, descriptive path (`muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf`). The medical records landing page links directly to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. The Spanish version was similarly accessible at a predictable URL. This is a model of straightforward form availability.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a significant shortcoming given that the form offers modern delivery options like encrypted email and MyChart. The form was clearly designed digitally (9 fonts, clean layout) but not built for digital completion.

The layout follows a logical progression: patient demographics → records source/destination → record types → purpose → date range → delivery method → legal disclosures → signature. The record-type options are well-designed, including a helpfully defined "Abstract" option. Five delivery methods are offered (mail, MyChart, fax, encrypted email, other) — above average for ROI forms. However, page 1 is dense, with legal disclosures compressed into a wall of small-print text at the bottom.

Language is a mix of plain instructions and legal/regulatory terminology. The opening warning ("FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION") is clear but intimidating. Rights disclosures reference specific CFR sections, which is appropriate but not patient-friendly.

## Barriers and Concerns

Several barriers exist. The form requires a **witness signature** — a line with no explanation of when or whether it's required, likely confusing patients into thinking it's always mandatory. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests. The form also requires attaching **a copy of patient identification** for all requests, not just representative requests — an extra step that adds friction for patients without easy copier access. The request for the **last 4 digits of SSN** is unnecessary for patient identification and may deter some patients.

The fee situation is a notable red flag. The MyChart instructional guide explicitly states that fees apply to "all patient requests released to the patient" including "search and duplication" — HIPAA only permits reasonable cost-based fees (not search fees) for patient access requests. The guide also describes a **prepayment requirement** before records are released, which may conflict with HHS/OCR guidance on patient access rights.

## Bright Spots

MUSC demonstrates genuine effort in several areas. The **Spanish-language form** (form-3) is a full professional translation preserving the complete structure and content of the English original, with bilingual headers — uncommon among organizations in this study. **Multiple pathways** (PDF, MyChart, Ciox eRequest) give patients genuine choice. **Multiple delivery methods** including encrypted email show digital awareness. The **multi-facility contact directory** on page 2 provides complete information for 9 MUSC locations, and the form explicitly references **45 CFR §164.524** (right to inspect/copy), making HIPAA rights visible to patients.

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health earns a **B grade** overall. The organization makes forms easy to find, offers multiple request pathways and delivery options, provides a Spanish-language version, and includes patient rights language. However, the generic third-party authorization form is not designed around patient self-access, the PDF lacks fillable fields despite digital distribution, and the fee/prepayment language raises compliance concerns. The witness signature and blanket ID requirements add unnecessary barriers. A dedicated patient access form with fillable fields and clearer fee disclosures would meaningfully improve the patient experience.

# Texas Oncology — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Texas Oncology provides a single ROI form — an "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf). Both are 3-page fillable PDFs, structurally identical, revised 09/19/2024. They are available as direct downloads from a dedicated Medical Records page at texasoncology.com/medical-records. The page outlines a clear 3-step process: download the form, complete it, and submit by fax or mail.

No patient portal submission, online request wizard, or third-party vendor platform (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was found. The only request pathway is the downloadable PDF form submitted by fax or mail.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Texas Oncology does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party disclosure. The single form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering nine disclosure reasons — Treatment, Personal Use, Billing, Legal Purposes, Disability Determination, School, Employment, Health Oversight, and Other. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" and then navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios, including filling in both "I authorize the following to disclose" (naming Texas Oncology) and "Who can receive and use the health information?" (naming themselves). This is awkward when the requester and recipient are the same person.

Notably, page 2 of the form includes a legally accurate statement that "This form is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual," citing 45 CFR §§ 164.502(a)(1)(i) and 164.524. However, this critical information is buried in supplementary legal text — not surfaced on page 1 where a patient would see it before completing the 3-page form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible from footer navigation (approximately one click from the homepage). While older PDF URLs found via web search returned 404 errors due to a site migration to Sitecore Edge CDN, the live page links worked without issue. No bot blocking, login walls, or captchas were encountered. Overall retrieval difficulty: easy to moderate — the slight complication was dead legacy URLs, but the current page is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed fillable PDF with 95 interactive fields — a thoroughly digitized form designed for on-screen completion. The layout is clean and logical: patient demographics → reason for disclosure → authorizing party → recipient → delivery method → record types → time period → signature. Section headers in all caps provide clear visual hierarchy.

The form offers 16 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, radiology reports, pathology, etc.) plus "All Health Information" and "Other," giving patients meaningful granularity. Four sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, genetic information, HIV/AIDS) require separate initialing, consistent with HIPAA and Texas law.

The language is reasonably plain for a legal authorization form. The statement that treatment cannot be denied for refusing to sign is prominently placed at the top of page 1 — better positioning than many ROI forms. However, the fee language on page 2 contains a grammatical error ("There may charge a retrieval/processing fee") and fails to specify amounts or distinguish patient-access fees from third-party disclosure fees.

The 95 fillable fields lack semantic names in the PDF metadata (all field names are empty), which impairs accessibility for screen readers and assistive technology.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Barriers are low to moderate.** No notarization is required — only a patient signature. No in-person submission is required; fax and mail are both accepted. The authorization expiration is reasonable (valid until death, revocation, or optional specified date). Right to revoke is clearly stated. The form includes current reproductive health protections (45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)) with a dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page — demonstrating up-to-date compliance with 2024 federal rules.

The main barrier is the lack of electronic submission: despite the fillable PDF and email as a records *delivery* option, patients must still print, sign, and fax or mail the form. There is no e-signature, portal upload, or online submission pathway.

Fee disclosure is vague — "a retrieval/processing fee may be charged" without specifics. No response time commitment is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: A professionally translated Spanish version is offered as a parallel download — commendable for a Texas-based practice serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **Reproductive health protections**: The dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page is current with 2024 federal law.
- **Email delivery option**: Records can be delivered via email, providing a practical electronic access mechanism.
- **Treatment-not-conditioned**: Prominently positioned at the top of page 1.

## Overall Assessment

Texas Oncology provides a competent but generic records request experience. The form is well-built as a document — fillable, logically organized, bilingual, and legally current. However, it funnels patients through a third-party authorization process rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. The buried acknowledgment that the form "is not required" for patient self-access only underscores this mismatch. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience. The organization earns a **B** grade — solid document quality and accessibility, held back by the lack of a patient-centered access pathway.

# Fallon Medical Complex — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Fallon Medical Complex (FMC) is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Baker, Montana — a rural community in the state's eastern plains. FMC publishes three documents on its Information Management page: a primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a verbal release form (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The primary ROI form is the relevant document for a patient seeking copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

FMC does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form — "Authorization for Access, Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same "Release From" / "Release To" fields used when authorizing disclosure to an insurer or attorney. The form does list "Personal" as a purpose option, which is helpful, but provides no guidance on how a patient should fill in the directional fields when they are both the requester and the recipient. This is a common pattern among small facilities, but it means the patient must figure out which parts of the form apply to their situation.

The verbal release form (form-2) is narrowly scoped to phone-based verbal sharing and explicitly directs patients to form-1 for copies. The NPP (form-3) describes patient rights including the right to inspect and copy records but does not cross-reference the actual forms.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Two web searches led directly to the Information Management page at fallonmedical.org, where all three documents are clearly linked. No login walls, CAPTCHAs, or bot blocking were encountered. The one notable issue: the primary ROI form is published as a Microsoft Word .doc file rather than a PDF, hosted on a Google Cloud Storage bucket with "tmp" in the URL path — an unusual and potentially fragile hosting arrangement for a permanent compliance document.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page document with **zero fillable fields**. It was published as a .doc file and had to be converted to PDF for this study. The lack of fillable fields means every patient must print and handwrite their information. The form has a text layer (not a scan), uses 5 fonts, and is visually legible, but the non-interactive format is a significant accessibility gap — especially for a geographically isolated community where patients may live far from the facility.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → release routing → purpose → record types → date range → disclosure format → sensitive information → patient rights → signatures. The information-type checkboxes offer good granularity (10 categories from "Emergency Report/Records" to "Entire Medical Record"). The dual sensitive-information sections — one for categories to include, one to exclude — are structurally sound but confusingly similar, with identical checkbox labels distinguished only by a header word.

Language is a mix of accessible and legalistic. The "I Understand That" section covers core rights (revocation, non-conditioning, inspection under §164.524) but is dense. There are two spelling errors ("immunodefiency" twice, "proving" for "providing") and a confusing interstitial note ("IF SENDING RECORDS TO FMC, PLEASE MAIL IF MORE THAN 20 PAGES") apparently directed at other facilities rather than patients.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization is required (the witness signature is in the "For Office Use Only" section). Photo ID is required for fax, mail, or email submissions — reasonable identity verification, though potentially burdensome for patients without government-issued ID. The statement "A HIM professional will supervise the review of my medical record" adds friction to in-person review that may feel paternalistic.

**Notable bright spots for a rural CAH:**
- **First copy free** — the form explicitly states patients may receive the first copy without charge, reducing financial barriers.
- **Seven disclosure format options** — paper mail, USB drive/disc, electronic fax, review only, paper pick-up, unencrypted email (with informed consent), and patient portal access. This is remarkably comprehensive for a 25-bed rural hospital.
- **Patient portal integration** — offering portal signup directly from the ROI form bridges paper and digital workflows.
- **Unencrypted email with informed consent** — respects patient autonomy while ensuring awareness of risks.

Submission of the completed form appears possible via fax, mail, or email (implied by the ID requirement language), meaning patients do not need to physically visit the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fallon Medical Complex demonstrates a sincere effort to serve patients within the constraints of a small rural facility. The breadth of delivery format options is genuinely impressive and patient-centered. However, the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a patient access request, published in an outdated format (.doc) with no fillable fields. A patient must print, handwrite, and fax or mail the form — a workflow that falls short of modern accessibility expectations. For a critical access hospital in rural Montana, FMC does better than many peers, but meaningful improvements are within reach: converting to a fillable PDF, separating the patient access pathway, and adding clear instructions for self-access requests would significantly improve the experience.

# SSM Health DePaul Hospital - St. Louis: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health DePaul Hospital in Bridgeton, MO is part of the SSM Health system, a major nonprofit health system operating across the Midwest. The hospital does not maintain its own medical records request forms; instead, it relies on SSM Health's system-wide forms. Two versions were found: an older system-wide form (form-1, "SSMHC" branding, dated 1/2019) and a current St. Louis metro–specific form (form-2, "SSM Health" branding). Form-2 is the applicable document for DePaul Hospital patients. Additionally, SSM Health's medical records page references an electronic request option through the **MRO Express portal** (mroexpress.mrocorp.com) for Missouri facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Both forms are dual-purpose documents titled "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," combining individual access requests and third-party disclosure authorizations into a single instrument. A patient requesting their own records must navigate structure designed for third-party releases — including a "disclose my protected health information to" recipient block with name, address, fax, and relationship fields. The "For personal access" option exists only as a checkbox buried under the "Purpose of Disclosure" section, alongside options like "Insurance/Workers' Compensation" and "Legal."

This dual-purpose design means patients must determine which fields to fill, which to skip, and how to route a form that assumes a releasing-to and releasing-from party. While technically functional, it is not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required moderate effort. The SSM Health medical records page (ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records) uses location-dependent content loading to surface region-specific forms, but the location selector's autocomplete reportedly failed during testing. Starting from DePaul Hospital's location page, the "Get Medical Records" link redirects to the system-wide page without directly linking the St. Louis metro form. A web search for SSM Health medical records forms did surface both PDFs, and the form-2 URL is descriptively structured. Overall, a patient would need 3+ clicks and some navigation persistence.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 — the relevant document — is a **single-page fillable PDF with 69 interactive fields**, representing a genuine digital-first design. Patients can complete the entire form electronically in any PDF viewer without printing. This is a clear strength. The form includes fields for patient demographics, type of access (inspection, hard copy, electronic copy), record type checkboxes with date fields (including sensitive categories like substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV-related information), purpose of disclosure, and a seven-item acknowledgement section covering HIPAA rights.

However, the language is **legalistic** throughout. The acknowledgement section contains seven dense paragraphs written in formal legal register. There are no separate instructions, no plain-language summary, and no guidance helping patients understand which fields apply to their situation. The single-page constraint results in compressed formatting and small text in the acknowledgement section. The form is English-only.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and **no in-person submission mandate**. Fees are disclosed as possible ("I may be required to pay the cost of creating paper copies or electronic media") but without specific amounts and with a TPO exception carve-out. A 30-day response time is committed, and the right to request review of access denials is clearly stated. Revocation rights and non-conditioning of care are explicitly covered.

The most notable concern is the **email delivery warning**: SSM Health states that encrypted email is "the only way to avoid third party interception" and frames unencrypted email delivery as a risky exception requiring patient acknowledgement. While email delivery is technically offered (form-2 includes an email field), the discouraging language may deter patients from choosing electronic delivery. An expiration date field — with research-oriented options — is misplaced for patient access requests and may confuse non-research requestors.

## Notable Strengths

- **69 fillable form fields** on a single page — genuinely fillable, not a flat scan
- **Email delivery option** with explicit email address field (form-2 improvement over form-1)
- **Granular record type selection** with sensitive-category breakouts for substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV
- **MRO Express portal** as an alternative electronic request pathway
- **Clear rights statements** covering 30-day timeline, denial review, and revocation

## Key Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as insurance companies and attorneys
- **Legalistic language** with no plain-language guidance or instructions
- **Email delivery framed as risky exception** rather than standard option
- **English-only** — no multilingual support
- **Expiration date field** inappropriate for patient access requests

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health DePaul Hospital earns a **C grade**. The fillable PDF form and MRO Express portal provide adequate technical infrastructure, and the form covers HIPAA compliance basics without imposing illegitimate barriers. However, the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, combined with dense legal language and no patient-facing guidance, means a patient must work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights. The org meets minimum requirements but falls short of patient-centered design.

# Troy Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Troy Regional Medical Center is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Troy, Alabama. The organization presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in the study: the only ROI form available is a decade-old, image-only scanned PDF hosted on a defunct legacy website, with no corresponding page or link on the hospital's current site.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page "Release of Information/PHI" authorization (form-1.pdf), dated February 2015. It is a general-purpose third-party release authorization—not a patient-access-specific form—though it does include a "Self" checkbox among the recipient options (alongside Physician, Attorney, and Other). No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

The form offers three delivery methods via checkbox: mail, fax, and in-person pickup. However, the form itself contains **no submission instructions**—no mailing address, fax number, email address, or department name. A patient who downloads and completes this form would have no idea where to send it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Troy Regional Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization that treats a patient requesting their own records identically to an attorney or physician requesting records on someone's behalf. The form's legal language—including a broad liability waiver and re-disclosure warnings—is oriented toward third-party release scenarios and is conceptually mismatched when a patient checks "Self."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required exceptional effort. The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) has no medical records page, no HIM department listing, and no downloadable forms. The Patient Information page returned a 502 Bad Gateway error. The form was ultimately located only on the hospital's legacy FastHealth-hosted site (trmc.fasthealth.com), which is no longer linked from the current site. A real patient navigating the current website would almost certainly fail to find this form. Only archival web searching revealed it.

## Form Document Quality

The form is an image-only scan (grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI) with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers, cannot be searched or copied, and must be printed and filled entirely by hand. The scan quality introduces some blur, and the legal text is in small (approximately 9–10pt) type. It is served over unencrypted HTTP.

Despite the poor technical quality, the visual layout is reasonably organized. The title is clear, fields flow logically from demographics to record type selection to signatures, and the form fits on a single page. Record type granularity is adequate, with 10+ checkbox options plus an "Entire Record" option and date range fields.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Several significant barriers are present:

- **"All fields MUST be completed" warning**: The form states that any blank field renders the authorization invalid—an overreach beyond HIPAA's actual requirements that could deter patients who cannot provide every piece of information.
- **Broad liability waiver**: Patients must discharge the facility from "any and all liabilities" as a condition of signing—not a HIPAA requirement and inappropriate for patient self-access.
- **Witness signature required**: A witness signature line adds an unnecessary step with no legal basis under HIPAA for patient access requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no contact information for where to send the completed authorization.
- **Anti-conditioning language contradicts itself**: The form states treatment may not be conditioned on authorization, then immediately notes that "if conditioning is permitted, refusal to sign... may result in denial of care."

## Strengths

The only modest bright spot is the record type granularity—patients can select specific record types or request the entire record, with date range specification. The form also correctly references revocation rights.

## Overall Assessment

Troy Regional Medical Center's patient access experience is among the poorest possible. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, image-only scan quality, generic third-party framing, multiple compliance red flags, and a form that is over a decade old paints a picture of an organization that has not invested in patient access infrastructure. A patient attempting to request their own records online from this facility would face a near-impossible task.

# AdventHealth Central Texas — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Central Texas is a nonprofit community hospital in Killeen, TX, part of the major AdventHealth system. Two ROI forms were found: a system-wide authorization form (form-1, ADV-800003A, rev. 2022) and a facility-specific "Request For Access And Authorization" form (form-2, AHCT 616, rev. 2005). Both were easily discoverable via web search, downloaded directly from the AdventHealth CDN with no barriers.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The facility-specific form (form-2) is the more relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. It explicitly includes a checkbox for "Provide me with access to the protected health information specified below" as its first option — a clear patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party disclosure. The system-wide form (form-1), by contrast, is architecturally a third-party disclosure form that funnels all requests through a "Disclose To" entity-naming structure. While it lists "Personal Use" as a purpose, a patient would need to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient.

The existence of both forms creates a "which form?" problem. Neither form references the other, and no landing page was found that explains when to use which. A patient could reasonably download the system-wide form first and never discover the more patient-friendly facility-specific version. That said, the facility-specific form does meaningfully differentiate patient access from third-party release — it presents four distinct action options (access, copies, disclosure to others, summary) rather than treating everything as a third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search for "AdventHealth Central Texas authorization release health information medical records form PDF" surfaced both PDFs immediately. No bot blocking, login walls, or navigation mazes were encountered. The forms are hosted on AdventHealth's CDN at direct URLs. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — full marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are digitally created PDFs with extractable text — neither is a scan. However, **neither form has any fillable/interactive fields** (both have zero fillable fields per metadata). Every field must be completed by hand after printing. This is a significant gap, especially for the system-wide form revised as recently as 2022. The "Affix Patient Label Here" boxes on form-2 further signal a paper-first, in-facility design never adapted for remote digital use.

Form-2 (the primary patient access form) is 2 pages with approximately 20–25 fields. The first page is reasonably organized: action checkboxes, patient demographics, record type selection (12 categories plus catch-alls), and a disclosure recipient section. The second page is a dense block of legal "I understand..." statements followed by signature blocks. The legal language is moderately formal but comprehensible. However, the lack of bullet points or visual separation in the legal text makes it harder to parse.

The system-wide form (form-1) is more complex, with 12 numbered sections spanning 48+ checkbox options across medical/surgical and behavioral health record types. It is visually overwhelming for a routine records request.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-2 requires a witness signature for all requests — not just behavioral health records. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access, making this an unnecessary barrier for patients completing the form at home.

**Fees**: Form-2 mentions a "reasonable, cost-based fee" but provides no specific amounts or fee schedule. The summary option pre-fills a blank for cost, setting an expectation of charges without transparency.

**90-day authorization cap**: Form-2 limits authorization to a maximum of 90 days, which is restrictive and conflates patient access requests (which don't require authorization under HIPAA) with third-party disclosure authorization.

**Wrong state law**: Form-1 references the "Illinois Mental Health and Development Disabilities Confidentiality Act" despite being served at a Texas facility — a clear legal citation error from a system-wide template not adapted for local jurisdiction.

**No notarization required**: Neither form requires notarization. Submission can be done by fax (254-526-7134) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit patient access pathway**: Form-2's first checkbox is "Provide me with access to the protected health information" — a rarity that centers patient self-access.
- **Broad catch-all category**: Form-2 includes "Any other personally identifiable information used by AdventHealth Central Texas to make medical decisions about me" — an unusually expansive request option.
- **Local contact information**: Form-2 provides facility-specific phone and fax numbers, unlike the generic system form.
- **Secure email delivery option**: Form-1 offers secure email as a delivery method, more progressive than fax-only alternatives.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: Both forms correctly state that refusing to sign will not affect treatment or benefits.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Central Texas offers a mixed experience. On the positive side, the facility-specific form includes genuine patient access language and the forms are trivially easy to find online. On the negative side, neither form is fillable, the facility form is over 20 years old, a witness signature creates unnecessary friction, and the two-form landscape creates confusion about which to use. The organization earns credit for having a patient access pathway at all — many peers offer only generic third-party authorization forms — but the execution falls short of modern standards for digital accessibility and form hygiene.

# Flowers Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Flowers Hospital in Dothan, Alabama, is a 235-bed for-profit community hospital owned by Triad of Alabama LLC and operating within the Community Health Systems (CHS) network. Three documents were retrieved: the hospital's official "Patient Request for Health Information" form (HIM-1406) in both English (form-2.pdf) and Spanish (form-3.pdf), plus an incidental release form from Wiregrass Surgical Associates, an affiliated practice housed at the hospital's Doctor's Center (form-1.pdf). The primary form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, the English HIM-1406.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated and Patient-Centered

Flowers Hospital provides a genuinely patient-centered access pathway. The official form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" — not "Authorization for Release" or "HIPAA Disclosure Form" — framing the interaction around the patient's own right of access. The form's recipient section lists "Myself" as the first option, with "Personal Representative" and "Other Third Party" as secondary choices. This clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release within a single, well-structured document.

Beyond the PDF, the hospital's medical records page offers an online request portal via Swellbox, providing a fully digital submission alternative. Between the fillable PDF (submittable via fax or mail) and the Swellbox portal, patients have multiple electronic submission options — no in-person visit or postal mail is required.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's website has a "Request Medical Records" page accessible from the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation. That page links directly to both the English and Spanish PDF forms and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative searching was needed. This is a model of how a hospital should surface its records request process.

## Form Document Quality

The HIM-1406 form is a single-page, digitally-designed PDF created in Adobe InDesign with 66 fillable AcroForm fields — an impressive level of interactivity for a one-page form. Every text input, checkbox, and selection area is digitally fillable, allowing patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing.

The form follows a logical seven-section flow: patient demographics, facility identification, record type selection (13 checkboxes including "Entire Record"), sensitive information opt-in (5 categories covering substance abuse, HIV, genetics, and psychiatric records), delivery method, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and accessible throughout. Five delivery methods are offered: paper, email (with appropriate risk disclosure), removable media (with password-protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media option with a password-protection toggle is an unusually thoughtful feature.

The Spanish version (HIM-1406S) is a complete, professional translation with identical structure and field count, linked co-equally alongside the English form — not a machine-generated afterthought.

## Barriers and Concerns

No significant barriers exist. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, and no excessive fee schedule. The form does include a witness signature field whose status as required or optional is ambiguous — this could deter patients completing the form at home. The fee disclosure is vague ("There may be charges associated with processing a request"), giving patients no way to estimate costs upfront. While not affirmatively problematic, greater fee transparency would better serve patients.

The form begins with an unexplained "*ROI*" header (internal jargon for "Release of Information") and the fillable fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader accessibility. The footer on the Spanish form remains in English — a minor inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

Flowers Hospital represents a strong example of patient-centered records access. The dedicated patient access form with "Myself" as the primary option, the comprehensive fillable PDF, the co-equal Spanish translation, the Swellbox portal alternative, and the easy findability from the main website all demonstrate genuine attention to the patient experience. The minor issues — ambiguous witness field, vague fee language, accessibility gaps — prevent a perfect score but do not materially impede a patient requesting their own records. This organization earns a grade of **A**.

# U.S. Dermatology Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides a single ROI form — "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — available as a one-page PDF from their Patient Forms page. Two copies were found online: form-1.pdf (uploaded March 2020, currently linked) and form-2.pdf (uploaded June 2019, orphaned but still publicly accessible). Both contain identical text, with a revision footer of "Rev 08/2017," indicating the content has not been substantively updated in nearly nine years. For patient self-access purposes, form-1.pdf is the relevant document.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Instead, it uses a generic HIPAA authorization form that bundles patient self-access with third-party release scenarios. "Patient Access" appears as one checkbox among five under "Purpose of Use/Disclosure," alongside "To Doctor," "To Insurance," "To Attorney," and "Other." The overall framing — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure" — is oriented toward third-party release, and a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form structure designed for a different purpose. For example, the recipient section asks for "Name of individual or organization" and its address, which is confusing when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" surfaced the PDF directly, and the Patient Forms page at `usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/` has a clearly labeled "Medical Records Release" link. No bot blocking, login wall, or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields** (`fillable_field_count: 0`), requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and physically sign. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow with clear sections for patient identification, disclosure direction, delivery method, purpose, date range, record types, and rights disclosures. Language is somewhat legalistic but generally readable. The form lacks instructions on where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is provided.

## Delivery and Submission

The form lists three delivery options for records: mailed, faxed, or electronic (patient portal only). However, these describe how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself is *submitted*. The form is silent on submission method, leaving patients without guidance. Given the lack of submission instructions and the non-fillable PDF, the workflow is effectively: download → print → hand-fill → unknown submission. The patient forms page and general website would likely require calling the office to determine where to send it; fax is presumably available once the patient contacts the office.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions**: The most significant usability gap. A patient who completes the form has no idea where to send it.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure," bundled into the authorization with no opt-out. This is overreaching for patient self-access requests.
- **Vague fee language**: "A reasonable fee may be charged for the records" does not distinguish patient-access requests (HIPAA-limited) from third-party releases, and gives no indication of actual costs.
- **Typo**: "IDS" instead of "AIDS" in the sensitive information disclosure — uncorrected since 2017.
- **No response time commitment**: No mention of turnaround time or the 30-day HIPAA requirement.
- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive fields despite being a digitally created PDF.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: The entire authorization fits on one page without being cramped — a respectful use of patient time.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment" is unambiguous and well-placed.
- **Easy online findability**: Directly linked from a well-organized Patient Forms page with clear labeling.
- **Patient rights disclosures**: Five bullet points covering right to a copy, right to inspect, right to revoke, voluntariness, and sensitive information notice.

## Overall Assessment

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides an easily findable, concise ROI form that technically accommodates patient self-access through a checkbox — but the form is fundamentally a third-party authorization repurposed for all disclosure scenarios. The lack of fillable fields, missing submission instructions, bundled liability waiver, and vague fee language collectively create a paper-era experience with notable friction points. The form has not been meaningfully updated since 2017. A patient can likely get their records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital is part of **Cottage Health**, a regional nonprofit system serving the Santa Barbara/Goleta area of California. The hospital does not maintain its own ROI forms; instead, it uses Cottage Health's system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (Form NS1405). Three documents were retrieved: the current English form (Aug 2025), a complete Spanish translation (Form NS1406, Aug 2025), and a superseded English version (Jun 2025). Cottage Health also offers an online electronic request pathway via Swellbox, linked from the same medical records page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

The primary form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of health information disclosure — to providers, insurers, attorneys, and the patient themselves. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. However, Section C includes a clear **"Patient (self)" checkbox**, so a patient requesting their own records can use the form without pretending to be a third party. The form's title ("Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information"), structure (redisclosure restrictions, recipient relationship fields), and framing are clearly built around the third-party release paradigm. A self-requesting patient must navigate sections that don't apply to them — recipient relationship, redisclosure restrictions — and there is no streamlined "I just want my own records" pathway on the PDF itself.

The **Swellbox online wizard** (linked from the medical records page) provides an alternative digital pathway that may be more patient-centric, though it was not evaluated in detail.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The medical records page sits at a clear navigation path (Home > Patients & Visitors > Accessing Your Medical Records) and is well-organized. The main friction was technical: the primary website URLs are protected by Akamai CDN, which blocks programmatic downloads. Azure Blob Storage mirror URLs worked without issue. The website also hosted both June and August 2025 versions simultaneously, creating minor version-confusion risk. The older version remains live at its original URL with no "outdated" notice.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a **2-page, digitally-authored PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. Despite this, it has **zero fillable/interactive form fields**. All checkboxes and text blanks are static visual elements. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and then scan or photograph it for electronic submission. This contradicts the form's own statement that "VALID ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES WILL BE ACCEPTED" — the form signals digital readiness but doesn't deliver it.

The layout is well-organized with **nine lettered sections (A–I)**, each with clear headings, following a logical flow: patient info → record scope → recipient → delivery method → expiration → rights → restrictions → cost → signature. The language is **mostly plain**, with an accessible opening statement about the right to refuse. Some passages lean toward legalese (redisclosure restrictions in Section G). At approximately 15–18 fields, the scope is reasonable for the content covered.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Submission methods** are genuinely flexible: email (medicalrecords@sbch.org), fax, and mail are all accepted. No in-person requirement exists. Electronic signatures are explicitly accepted. **No notarization** is required.

**Fees** are vaguely disclosed: "There may be a fee for copies of medical records. You will be notified in advance." No fee schedule or amount is provided, and the waiver for provider-to-provider transfers could imply that patient self-requests do incur fees. The form commits to a **15-day turnaround**, faster than HIPAA's 30-day requirement.

One **red flag**: the opening warning that "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" could function as a barrier, potentially giving the organization grounds to reject incomplete but actionable requests. HIPAA does not permit denying access based on incomplete non-essential fields.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version**: A complete, professionally translated form (NS1406) — not a summary — demonstrating genuine linguistic accessibility for the Goleta/Santa Barbara community.
- **MyChart delivery option**: Patients can receive records directly through the patient portal, a modern approach many organizations lack.
- **Swellbox online alternative**: A fully digital request pathway exists alongside the PDF, giving patients a choice.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Email, fax, and mail all accepted — no physical visit required.
- **California sensitive-category handling**: Appropriate opt-in checkboxes for Mental Health, Chemical Dependency, HIV, and Reproductive Healthcare with state law citations.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Health provides a **competent but not exemplary** patient access experience. The system earns credit for offering multiple pathways (PDF, Swellbox portal, email/fax submission), a Spanish translation, and MyChart delivery. However, the core form is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF undermines the digital workflow the system otherwise supports. The vague fee language and "invalidation" warning are minor compliance concerns. A patient can successfully request their own records through this system without undue hardship, but the process could be meaningfully improved with a patient-specific form and interactive PDF fields.

**Grade: B** — Good overall with room for improvement in patient-centeredness and technical accessibility of the PDF form.

# A.O. Fox Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

A.O. Fox Hospital is a community hospital in Oneonta, NY, part of the Bassett Healthcare Network. It does not maintain its own medical records request form; instead, patients are directed to a single, network-wide "Authorization for Medical Record Release" (form H-6653) shared across all five Bassett facilities. This is the sole form available and serves as the primary pathway for any patient — whether requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Access Pathway

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of medical record release, not a dedicated patient access request form. However, it does meaningfully accommodate patient self-access: Section 2 includes a "Self, address listed above" checkbox, Section 7 offers "Patient Request" as a purpose option, and Section 4 defaults to electronic delivery via the MyBassett Portal when no format is specified. These features ensure a patient can navigate the form for self-access without excessive confusion, but the form's framing as an "Authorization for Medical Record Release" — rooted in 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization concepts rather than § 164.524 Right of Access — means patients are signing an authorization they don't technically need, and must navigate sections (verbal communication authorization, expiration dates, redisclosure warnings) that are largely irrelevant to self-access.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the pathway level. There is no separate patient access form, no distinct web page for individual record requests, and no portal-based request wizard. The single PDF form serves all purposes.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**, though not via A.O. Fox Hospital directly. A search for Fox-specific forms returned nothing; searching for the parent system — Bassett Healthcare Network — immediately surfaced a direct PDF link on bassett.org. A patient who knows Fox is part of Bassett would locate this quickly. One who searches only for "A.O. Fox Hospital medical records" might need an extra step. No bot blocking, broken links, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-constructed, digital-first fillable PDF** — one of the strongest technical implementations in the study. Key characteristics:

- **Fillable fields**: 83 AcroForm interactive fields across just 2 pages, covering every checkbox, text input, and signature area. This is unusually thorough.
- **Layout**: 10 clearly numbered sections with bold headings provide logical flow and easy scanning.
- **Delivery options**: Seven methods offered (MyBassett Portal, USB, CD, Fax, US Mail, in-person pickup at two locations, Email with encrypted/unencrypted options). The portal-first default is a progressive design choice.
- **Record type selection**: 13 categories plus "Entire Medical Record" and an open-ended "Other" field, with date range controls.
- **Sensitive records**: An opt-out model (Section 6) lets patients exclude categories they don't want disclosed, rather than requiring explicit opt-in for each — a patient-protective default.

**Weaknesses** are minor but notable: two typos ("Frist" for "First", "DISCLOUSRE" for "DISCLOSURE"), internal Windows file paths exposed in the revision line (`d:\forms\hosp\.ofm`), and dense legalese in the rights section — particularly the HIV/AIDS redisclosure paragraph, which is a single four-line sentence. The form does not mention fees or response times.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. The form requires only a patient signature — no notarization, no witness, no in-person submission requirement. The no-conditioning statement is clearly articulated. The one-year date range default ("If left blank, information from the past (1) year will be provided") could inadvertently limit scope for patients seeking older records, but this is a scope default rather than a true barrier.

## Bright Spots

- **Portal-first default delivery** is rare and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **83 fillable fields** on a 2-page form represents exceptional digital-first design.
- **Seven delivery format options** including encrypted email with explicit risk acknowledgment.
- **Opt-out model for sensitive records** defaults toward completeness.
- **No-conditioning language** explicitly protects patient rights.

## Overall Assessment

A.O. Fox Hospital, through its parent Bassett Healthcare Network, provides a technically excellent form that is easy to find and free of major barriers. The form's primary limitation is structural: it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual right of access — through a generic authorization framework designed for third-party release. While the form accommodates patient self-access well, it does not center it. A dedicated patient access pathway or a clearly separated section for self-access requests would elevate this from a good form to an exemplary one. Grade: **B**.

# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Newton-Wellesley Hospital (NWH) is a community hospital in Newton, MA, part of the Mass General Brigham (MGB) health system (formerly Partners HealthCare). For medical records requests, NWH uses the system-wide MGB authorization form rather than a facility-specific document. Two forms were found: the current MGB-branded authorization (form-1, dated 06/2024) and a legacy Partners HealthCare version (form-2, dated 01/2006) that remains accessible at an orphaned URL on nwh.org but is no longer linked from current navigation.

## Access Pathway

NWH does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary (and only current) form is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" designed to serve all release scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, and other recipients. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as someone authorizing release to a third party, selecting "Personal" as the purpose and checking a box to have records mailed to their own address. While functional, this approach requires patients to identify which sections apply to them and which to skip, without explicit guidance distinguishing patient access rights from third-party authorization.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. It frames the interaction as an "authorization" rather than a right, which is technically appropriate for third-party releases but conceptually misaligned for patient self-access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The NWH website provides a clear navigable path (Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records), though this redirects to the MGB parent system's medical records page where the user must expand a "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" accordion to access the download. This extra indirection is minor. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1) is a high-quality digital artifact. It features **78 fillable/interactive form fields** — checkboxes, text inputs, and date fields are all functional for on-screen completion. The form is organized into five clearly lettered sections (A through E) with a logical flow: patient info → permission/purpose → record types → sensitive information → understanding/signature. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The header prominently displays submission instructions (mailing address and fax number), and the form offers four delivery methods for the records themselves: Patient Gateway (portal), Secure Email, Fax, and Paper Copy via Mail. The inclusion of electronic delivery options is a notable strength.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though Section D (sensitive information authorization) contains dense regulatory text, particularly the 42 CFR Part 2 disclosure. This is legally required but not reader-friendly.

**Multilingual support** is a bright spot: the MGB medical records page offers the form in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

## Barriers

**Notarization**: Not required. Only a patient signature is needed.

**Fees**: The form subtly differentiates — copying fees are asterisked only for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes, while "Personal" and "Medical Care" are not marked, implying no fees for patient access requests. However, this is implicit rather than explicitly stated.

**Date requirement**: Section C states patients "MUST specify dates" (capitalized emphasis) for each record type category. HIPAA does not require patients to specify date ranges, and this requirement could function as a barrier for patients seeking comprehensive access to their records.

**Outside records carve-out**: Records from outside providers held by MGB will not be released unless the patient specifically requests them under "Other" — placing a knowledge burden on patients who may not know what outside records exist in their file.

## Strengths

- 78 fillable form fields enabling genuine digital completion
- Four delivery methods including portal and secure email
- Trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Portuguese)
- Implicit fee exemption for patient access requests
- Clean, well-organized layout with clear section headers
- Easy findability via web search or website navigation

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway; generic third-party authorization form only
- "MUST specify dates" requirement potentially exceeds HIPAA requirements
- No explicit statement of patient Right of Access
- Outside records require special knowledge to request
- Submission limited to fax or mail (no online form submission)

## Overall Assessment

Newton-Wellesley Hospital, through its parent system MGB, provides a technically well-executed authorization form that is easy to find and genuinely usable digitally. The form's 78 fillable fields, multilingual availability, and multiple delivery options represent above-average document quality. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, funneling all requestors through a generic authorization form. The "MUST specify dates" requirement and lack of Right of Access framing are missed opportunities to center the patient experience. Overall, this is a competent but generic approach — the form works, but it wasn't designed with the patient requesting their own records as the primary audience.

# Copley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Copley Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Morrisville, Vermont. The hospital offers a single Release of Information form — titled "Patient Request for Health Information Authorization Form" (Form 1085, dated 07-21) — that serves as the primary pathway for patients seeking their own health records. No patient portal–based request option or online submission wizard was identified; the form is a downloadable PDF linked from the hospital's Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Copley's form is a **dual-purpose authorization** that handles both patient self-access and third-party release on a single page. The form includes a clear checkbox for "Provide a copy of my records to: Me," which meaningfully distinguishes the patient self-access use case — but it does not separate this pathway from third-party release. A patient requesting their own records encounters fields irrelevant to their situation, such as "Release my Records TO:" (with recipient name, address, fax, and phone fields) and "Purpose of Release." Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not state a purpose for requesting their own records, so the presence of this field — without clarification that it's optional for self-requests — could confuse or deter patients.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the phrase "Right of Access." While the authorization language (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure warning) is well-written, the form frames the interaction as an *authorization* rather than an *access right*, which is a conceptual distinction that matters for patient-centeredness.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Copley Hospital's release of information form immediately surfaced a direct link to the PDF. The form is also prominently linked from the Medical Records page under "For Patients + Visitors" in the main site navigation. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was required. The hospital's Medical Records page also links to three related HIPAA forms (amendment request, alternate communication, PHI restrictions), which shows a thoughtful information architecture even if the ROI form itself is the only one relevant to record requests.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page PDF** — impressively compact — with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → delivery/format options → authorization scope → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. The language is largely plain and accessible, with standout phrasing like "My treatment will not be impacted, no matter if I sign this Authorization or not."

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). This means patients must print and hand-fill the form, then fax or mail it back. The delivery and format options are notably strong — in-person pickup, mail, fax, and patient portal for delivery, plus paper copy or electronic copy (email, USB, CD, portal) for format — and the form helpfully notes that "Many documents that you may be requesting are available to you in your patient portal." But the submission process itself requires either fax (802-888-8361) or mail to the HIM department.

## Barriers & Compliance

**No notarization or witness** is required. Representative signers must attach proof of authority, which is a reasonable requirement. The authorization is valid for one year with clear revocation instructions including both mailing and fax addresses.

**Fees are not mentioned** anywhere on the form, leaving patients unable to anticipate costs. This is a notable gap — HIPAA requires transparency about fees for patient access requests.

The form is dated July 2021 and predates the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective April 2023), suggesting it may not reflect current requirements around electronic health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- **Comprehensive delivery and format options** — email, USB, CD, patient portal, fax, mail, and in-person pickup
- **Single-page efficiency** — all necessary content on one page
- **Clear voluntariness statement** in plain language
- **Easy findability** — prominent placement and search-engine accessible

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** — forces a paper workflow despite digital authorship
- **No fee disclosure** — patients cannot anticipate costs
- **"Purpose of Release" field** not flagged as optional for self-requests
- **No explicit Right of Access framing** — treated as authorization rather than access right
- **Form staleness** — over 4 years old, predating information blocking rules

## Overall Assessment

Copley Hospital provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience anchored by easy findability, a compact single-page form, plain language, and strong delivery/format options. The dual-purpose design accommodates patient self-access but doesn't optimize for it. The primary weaknesses — lack of fillable fields and absence of fee disclosure — represent missed opportunities rather than active barriers. Fax submission is available, providing an adequate electronic pathway. For a small critical access hospital, this is a competent if imperfect effort that would benefit from modernization: adding fillable fields, separating or clearly labeling the self-access pathway, and disclosing fee information.

# UW Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UW Medical Center, part of the UW Medicine system (University of Washington), provides a single ROI form for all of its facilities: "Patient Authorization to Disclose, Release, and/or Obtain Protected Health Information" (form U0626, version V.2512, last approved December 2025). This 3-page fillable PDF covers Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center (Montlake and Northwest campuses), UW Medicine Primary Care, and UW Physicians. No separate patient-access-specific form exists — this is a generic HIPAA authorization serving both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UW Medicine does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from third-party authorization. The single form handles all release scenarios — attorneys, providers, insurers, and patients alike. The "Purpose of Request" section includes a "Personal" checkbox, and the "Recipient of Records" field lists "Patient" as one example alongside "Insurance Company, Attorney, Physician." A patient can certainly use this form, but the framing treats self-access as one option among many rather than a first-class use case.

However, UW Medicine partially compensates with an outstanding **MyChart fast-track**: the form opens with a prominent callout — *"Recent medical records are available via MyChart for immediate download without filling out this form"* — and page 3 elaborates with instructions and a URL. The form also notes that an electronic request form is available within MyChart as an alternative. This effectively creates a two-tier system: MyChart for recent records (instant, self-service), and the paper authorization for everything else.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. Web searches for UW Medical Center ROI terms immediately surfaced it, and the UW Medicine website's Patient Forms page links directly to the canonical URL on the UW compliance site (`depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf`). One complication: the uwmedicine.org CDN blocks programmatic downloads (403 errors), but since the official patient forms page links to the compliance-hosted version, patients following the normal path encounter no issues. No browser fallback was needed for the working URL.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-designed interactive PDF with **61 fillable fields**, a full text layer, and 10 embedded fonts — clearly a digital-first document, not a scan. The layout follows a logical **numbered structure** (Items #1–7): patient information, purpose, facility selection, recipient, record types, format preferences, and expiration. This is easy to follow and a patient could complete it without assistance.

**Language** is mostly plain and accessible, though the patient rights section on page 2 includes a dense legal paragraph about conditioning treatment on authorization that would challenge many readers. Page 3 provides item-by-item **completion instructions** — an unusual and genuinely helpful addition that sets this form apart.

**Delivery format options** are exceptional: CD/DVD, Paper, MyChart, USB/Thumb Drive, and Email — five choices, more than nearly any other provider form. **Submission channels** are equally strong: postal mail, fax ((206) 744-9997), and email (uwmedroi@uw.edu), with separate contacts for billing records.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. There is **no notarization or witness requirement**, no in-person submission mandate, and no fee disclosure on the form (neither a stated fee nor a stated exemption). The 3-year default authorization expiration is generous. Revocation requires a written request to the Compliance Office — standard but could be more accessible.

One ambiguity: the form includes a blanket statement that the authorization "permits UW Medicine to release information related to sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, behavioral or mental health services, and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse," which could confuse patients about whether signing automatically releases all sensitive categories.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart fast-track** at the top of the form actively diverts patients to faster self-service
- **Five delivery formats** give patients genuine choice
- **Three submission channels** (mail, fax, email) with complete contact information
- **Instruction page** with item-by-item guidance and honest expectations about record completeness
- **Multi-facility coverage** via a single form with clear facility checkboxes
- **Sensitive information opt-in model** for specific unit records (sexual assault, mental health, living donor)

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access form — generic authorization serves all purposes
- No mention of HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or fee limits for patient access
- "PLACE PATIENT LABEL HERE" hospital artifact may confuse patients filling out at home
- Fillable field names are empty in metadata, potentially indicating accessibility deficiencies for screen readers

## Overall Assessment

UW Medical Center provides a **competent, well-designed generic authorization form** with strong digital capabilities and multiple submission options. The MyChart promotion is a standout patient-centering feature that partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway. The form's thorough instruction page, granular record selection, and five delivery formats demonstrate genuine care for usability. The main gap is structural: patients requesting their own records navigate the same form designed for attorneys and insurers, with no acknowledgment that their rights and fee protections differ. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and mostly patient-friendly, but not designed around patient self-access as a primary use case.

# Abbeville Area Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Abbeville Area Medical Center (AAMC) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Abbeville, South Carolina. Two documents were found on its website: an authorization form for releasing protected health information (form-1.pdf) and a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices brochure (form-2.pdf). Only the authorization form is relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Patient Self-Access Distinction

AAMC provides a single, generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (HIM 1022) for all record requests. The form is clearly designed for third-party release — it asks the patient to identify a "Name/Facility" recipient and authorize disclosure "to the following individual or group." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the patient and the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no separate pathway or section for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524, and no mention of the right to access one's own records anywhere on the authorization form.

The companion HIPAA brochure (form-2.pdf) does articulate patient rights well, including the right to electronic copies and a 30-day response timeline, but this informational document is entirely disconnected from the authorization workflow. A patient would need to read two separate documents and synthesize the information themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via Patients & Visitors navigation. The PDF is directly linked and downloads without login, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking. The WordPress site is simple and functional. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form is a single page — admirably brief compared to multi-page forms at other organizations. It follows a logical numbered structure: authorization/recipient identification, record type selection (16 specific checkboxes), dates of service, purpose, and signature block. However, the form has significant technical limitations:

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields. All checkboxes are static Unicode characters, and all blanks are underscored lines. A patient must print the PDF and fill it in by hand.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no address, fax number, email, or department contact. A patient downloading this from the website would have no idea where to send the completed form. The fax number and mailing address must be found separately (the NPP brochure provides the Privacy Officer's P.O. Box and phone number).
- **No "All Records" option**: The 16 granular checkboxes are useful for targeted requests but there is no "Complete Medical Record" option for patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Ambiguous fields**: Item 2 ("Date records were printed and/or CD was requested") appears to be an internal staff field but is numbered as if patients should complete it.

The language is a mix of plain English at the top and denser legal boilerplate at the bottom. Required fields are marked with asterisks, but the legend ("* Must Have Information") appears only at the very bottom of the page.

## Barriers

- **Witness requirement**: The form requires two witness signatures (marked with asterisks as required), which goes beyond HIPAA requirements for patient self-access and creates a logistical barrier.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: The form automatically includes authorization to release psychiatric, substance abuse, HIV, and STD records with no opt-out mechanism. Patients who want general medical records but wish to exclude sensitive categories cannot do so.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signing, which could force resubmission if processing is delayed.
- **No fee information**: The form discloses nothing about costs. The NPP brochure vaguely mentions "there will be a charge" without amounts.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: Everything fits on one page, reducing patient burden.
- **Fax acceptance**: The form explicitly states "A faxed copy of this release shall be deemed as having the same effect as the original," enabling remote submission.
- **Granular record-type selection**: The 16 checkboxes give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **NPP quality**: The privacy brochure includes clear language about the right to electronic copies and a 30-day timeline — strong for a small critical access hospital.

## Overall Assessment

AAMC provides a minimally adequate but dated approach to patient record requests. The form is easy to find and mercifully short, but it offers no digital-first workflow, no patient-access-specific pathway, and no submission instructions. A patient must print the form, handwrite their information, find a fax number or mailing address from a separate document, and obtain two witness signatures — all to exercise a fundamental HIPAA right. The organization earns credit for accessibility of retrieval and brevity of form, but loses ground on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and unnecessary barriers. Grade: **C**.

# Esse Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Esse Health is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in St. Louis, Missouri. Two documents were retrieved from their patient forms page: an Authorization for Release of Medical Information (form-1.pdf) and a communication/message authorization (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own health records. Notably, Esse Health also offers a DocuSign-based electronic submission pathway for the same ROI form, which meaningfully improves the overall patient experience.

## Access Pathway

Esse Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single ROI form (form-1.pdf) is a generic HIPAA authorization with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED BY" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields — a structure designed for records transfers between providers or releases to attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no separate section for individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient requesting their own records has different rights than a third party requesting records on someone's behalf.

The form does cite 45 CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA right of access provision), which is a positive signal, but this is buried in a dense paragraph of legal language rather than presented as guidance for patients. The availability of a DocuSign electronic submission option is a genuine bright spot — it allows patients to complete and submit the form digitally without printing, scanning, or visiting the office.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF URL, and the patient forms page at `essehealth.com/patient-center/patient-forms/` is well-organized with clear labeling under "General Forms." No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The retrieval was rated **easy**. One minor issue: the communication authorization form (form-2) has "Medical Records" in its website title, which could mislead a patient looking for the actual records release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF. While the metadata reports 28 fillable field annotations, the field names array is empty, suggesting the fields may not be properly configured for interactive use. The form relies on underline blanks — it was designed primarily as a print-and-write document. However, the DocuSign alternative compensates significantly by providing a fully interactive digital pathway.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, release from/to fields, 11 record-type checkboxes, sensitive information disclosure, revocation and expiration language, and signature. The language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese — the opening authorization statement is clear, but the disclosure paragraphs covering HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse are denser. At one page, the form is appropriately concise without being cramped.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment. It provides a six-month default expiration and a revocation mechanism, though the revocation language ("present my written cancellation to the health information management department") is ambiguous about whether this can be done remotely. Fee disclosure is vague — "there may be a charge associated with copying my health information" — with no specifics about amounts or HIPAA's cost-based limits. No delivery format options (electronic, paper, mail, pick-up) are mentioned, which is a gap for patient self-access scenarios. Submission options include the DocuSign electronic pathway, making electronic submission available.

## Overall Assessment

Esse Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The key strength is the DocuSign electronic submission option, which elevates the experience above many peers by enabling end-to-end digital completion and submission. The key weakness is the lack of any differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — the generic authorization form forces patients to navigate a process not designed for them. The form itself is clean and concise but not interactive, and the fee disclosure is vague. For an independent physician practice, this represents a middle-of-the-road effort: the form is easy to find and usable, but the organization has not invested in a patient-centered access pathway.

# NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) provides a well-organized, multi-channel records request system anchored by a system-wide "Tripartite" HIPAA authorization form shared across NYP, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medicine. Three documents were retrieved: the primary Tripartite ROI form (form-1), a patient-facing FAQ (form-2), and an older Lawrence campus-specific variant (form-3). The organization directs patients primarily to a Verisma online portal, with MyChart and paper form submission as alternatives.

## Access Pathway & Differentiation

NYP offers genuine differentiation at the pathway level: the medical records page provides separate Verisma portal links for Patient, Patient Representative, and Attorney workflows. This is a meaningful distinction that helps patients identify their correct route. However, the underlying authorization framework remains generic — the paper form (form-1) is a single HIPAA authorization used for all disclosure types, with "Patient Request" as one of seven checkboxes alongside Life Insurance, Legal Purposes, and Worker's Comp. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish the legal framework for patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization section states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records," which is accurate for third-party releases but misleading for patient access requests, where HIPAA requires only a written request, not a signed authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records) leads to a well-organized page. Web searches readily surface both the medical records page and direct PDF links. The form is hosted on a digital asset management platform (nyp.widen.net), which initially served an HTML viewer rather than the raw PDF, requiring some effort to extract the actual download URL. This is a minor friction point for an otherwise easy retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is technically excellent. It is a born-digital, fully interactive PDF with 103 fillable fields — one of the most technically capable ROI forms in this study. The 2-page form follows a logical flow through patient demographics, recipient information, disclosing entity selection (covering all 11 NYP campuses plus outpatient groups), granular record-type checkboxes (16+ options including "Entire Medical Record"), sensitive information authorization (compliant with New York state law for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing), six delivery methods, and a numbered authorization section. The layout is clean with bold section headers, though the density of content on two pages results in small text in places. The authorization language includes some compound legalese that is difficult to parse, but the overall organization is strong.

The form is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese — a notable accommodation for New York City's diverse population.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on the primary form (though the older Lawrence form-3 includes a "Witness or Notary" line). The Verisma portal requires two forms of photo ID, which exceeds typical HIPAA identity verification expectations and may exclude patients without two scannable photo IDs. The form mandates a date-of-service range, stating "records will not be released unless Date of Service section is complete" — a potential barrier for patients seeking their complete longitudinal record. Fees are described as "reasonable fees to recover costs," tracking HIPAA's statutory language without specifying amounts. No response time commitment appears on the form or FAQ.

## Notable Strengths

NYP's system stands out for its dedicated phone line (646-NYP-4ROI, M-F 8am-6pm), multilingual form availability, comprehensive FAQ document with transparent MyChart record-type listings, and the sheer technical quality of the fillable PDF. The six delivery options — paper, fax, email, CD, flash drive, and patient portal (at no cost) — give patients meaningful choice.

## Overall Assessment

NYP delivers a technically strong, well-organized records request experience with good findability and multiple access channels. The main weakness is the lack of a truly patient-access-specific pathway: despite portal-level differentiation, the underlying form treats patient self-access as one use case among many without acknowledging the distinct legal rights involved. The two-photo-ID portal requirement and mandatory date-of-service range create unnecessary friction. Overall, this is a solid B-level experience — above average in technical execution but falling short of patient-centered design.

# Memorial Healthcare System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Memorial Healthcare System (Hollywood, FL) is a government-owned regional hospital system serving South Florida. The system's medical records page provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" form available in three languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole), plus a separate Request for Amendment form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form; all record requests flow through the same HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release.

## Pathways and Primary Form

The primary pathway is a downloadable PDF form (form-1.pdf in English) linked from the main website at Patients & Visitors > Medical Records. The form lists five delivery methods — Pick-up, Mail Out, e-Delivery, CD, and MyChart — prominently at the top, showing the org supports both traditional and electronic record delivery. MyChart is referenced as a delivery option, suggesting patients may also be able to request records through their patient portal. The medical records page states a two-business-day processing commitment, far faster than the HIPAA-allowed 30-day window.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is titled "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" and is structured around disclosing records to a named recipient (Section 4: "This information is to be released to: Name / Address"). While an email field explicitly reads "I request my records be sent to me at this e-mail address" — clear patient-access language — the overall form design is a generic authorization. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and Section 5h requires patients to state a purpose for the disclosure, which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form and process as an attorney or insurer, figuring out which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The medical records page is linked from the main navigation, the PDF is directly downloadable without login or CAPTCHA, and all language versions are grouped on the same page. No bot blocking was encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — every checkbox, text field, and signature line must be completed by hand after printing. This is consistent across all three language versions. The file is bloated at 2.45 MB (vs. ~700 KB for the identically structured Spanish and Creole versions), with 23 embedded fonts and garbled hidden content from overlapping template layers — including staff business cards, physician rosters, and internal template labels like "JDCH Oncology BC (Multiple Doctors & Locations) FRONT." This hidden content inflates file size and produces garbled output for assistive technologies.

The form's content is organized in five numbered sections with logical flow: facility selection, patient identification, record type selection (~15 granular options), recipient information, and acknowledgment statements. The acknowledgments (Sections 5a–5h) are dense legal text — particularly the electronic delivery risk-shifting language in 5e, which requires patients to "knowingly and voluntarily assume this risk and all consequences, losses and damages" for electronic records. This language could discourage patients from exercising their right to receive records electronically.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No notarization or witness is required.** Fees are not disclosed on the form itself; the website mentions "copy charges as authorized by Florida law" with an exception for records sent to treating physicians. The six-month authorization expiration is standard. No in-person-only submission restriction exists — forms can be mailed. However, there is no explicit electronic submission pathway for the form itself (no fax, no email-based submission explicitly stated, though MyChart may serve this role).

**Bright spots** are notable. The trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is exemplary and uncommon — most organizations offer at most English and Spanish. The five delivery methods, including e-Delivery and MyChart, are forward-thinking. The two-business-day processing commitment is remarkably fast. Granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control.

**Red flags** include the electronic delivery risk-shifting language (Section 5e), the purpose field that may create an impression that patients need to justify their access, and the bloated English PDF with garbled hidden content that affects accessibility tools.

## Overall Assessment

Memorial Healthcare System demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness in several areas — multilingual access, fast processing, and electronic delivery options — but is held back by a non-fillable, generic authorization form that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The form's paper-based workflow and dense legal language create unnecessary friction. The org earns a solid **B** grade overall: excellent findability and some compliance strengths offset by a fundamentally paper-based process and a form that wasn't designed with patients as the primary audience.

# Synthesis: Duly Health and Care

## Overview

Duly Health and Care (Downers Grove, IL) is a large independent, for-profit physician practice formerly known as DuPage Medical Group. Four PDF documents were retrieved: one Duly-branded ROI authorization (form-1), two MediCopy vendor authorization forms (forms 2 and 4), and one specialized FMLA/disability intake form (form-3). The primary form for patient self-access is **form-1**, Duly's own "Authorization for Release of Health Information," processed by ScanSTAT Technologies and last updated June 2023.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Duly does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. All four forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any disclosure purpose. Form-1's "Purpose of Disclosure" section includes a "Personal Reasons" checkbox, and forms 2 and 4 offer "Personal Use," but none of these forms are specifically designed around the patient's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. The same witness requirements, fee language, and expiration terms apply regardless of whether the patient is requesting records for themselves or authorizing release to a third party.

The form header does note that records "may be available through MyDMGHealth" (the MyChart patient portal), suggesting a digital self-service alternative exists — but this is a brief aside, not a developed pathway. Delivery methods on form-1 include fax, mail, MyChart, secure e-delivery, and pick-up, which is above-average flexibility. Submission of the completed form can be done via fax (630-873-8797) or email (mrrequests@dupagemd.com), so a patient can submit without visiting the facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Duly's forms was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned direct PDF links on the first attempt. Duly hosts forms on Azure blob storage, and a dedicated medical records request page exists at `dulyhealthandcare.com/services/medical-records-requests`. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor friction: the coexistence of Duly-branded and MediCopy-branded forms could confuse a patient about which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF with a text layer and clean extraction, but **zero fillable fields**. It is a print-and-fill document. Despite being "Updated 062023," the form retains legacy branding — the email uses `@dupagemd.com`, the MyChart URL references `dupagemedicalgroup.com`, and the form ID starts with "DMG." The layout is organized into six clearly numbered sections with a logical flow (patient info → records requested → recipient → delivery → purpose → signature). Record-type checkboxes are granular (11 categories including imaging CDs), and date format examples are provided — helpful details many forms lack. However, the legal text in Section 6 is dense, presented as a continuous block in small type.

The MediCopy forms (2 and 4) use friendlier conversational headings ("Tell us about the patient," "Where are we sending the records?") but also lack fillable fields and have their own issues: form-2 has no submission contact information at all, while form-4 adds a witness requirement.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-1 requires a witness signature unless the request is for continuation/transfer of care or records go directly to the patient. A patient requesting records for "Personal Reasons" must find a witness — an unusual burden with no HIPAA basis. Form-4 imposes the same requirement.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "Charges may apply. Please contact us for details. Cash payments are not accepted." No fee schedule is provided, no amounts are indicated, and there is no acknowledgment that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests. The cash-payment prohibition is unexplained.

**"All records" rejection**: Form-1 explicitly states that "'All records' or incomplete dates are not considered specific." This may improperly limit patient access under HIPAA, which permits patients to request their entire designated record set.

**No notarization** is required — a positive. **Response time** is not stated.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple delivery methods** including MyChart, secure e-delivery, fax, mail, and pick-up — five options on form-1.
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** with 11 categories give patients specific control.
- **Explicit date format examples** reduce ambiguity.
- **Patient rights statements** in form-1's Section 6 cover revocation, right to inspect, right to refuse, and re-disclosure — comprehensive if dense.
- **Easy retrieval** — forms found quickly with no technical barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Duly Health and Care provides a functional but undifferentiated records request process. The primary form is well-organized and offers good delivery flexibility, but it funnels all requests — patient self-access and third-party releases alike — through a single generic authorization with unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, fee opacity, rejection of blanket record requests). The form is not fillable, retains outdated branding, and does not acknowledge the distinction between patient access rights and third-party authorization. A patient can complete the process (print, fill, fax), but the experience is not designed around their needs as a rights-holder under HIPAA.

# Cuba Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cuba Memorial Hospital is a small, independent critical access hospital in Cuba, NY, affiliated with the Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) alongside Olean General Hospital (OGH) and Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC). The hospital does not publish its own medical records request form. Instead, patients must discover and use ROI forms from affiliated UAHS facilities, found on a separate organization's website.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two forms were retrieved, both from the BRMC-OGH website (brmc-ogh.org), not from Cuba Memorial's own site:

- **Form 1 (OGH)**: "Authorization for Patient Access and/or Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," branded for Olean General Hospital. This is the most relevant form since both OGH and Cuba Memorial are New York facilities within UAHS.
- **Form 2 (BRMC)**: Nearly identical form branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Less relevant due to cross-state jurisdiction, but its blank disclosing-organization field makes it theoretically more adaptable.

The hospital's website also mentions a "YourHEALTH" patient portal for electronic record access, but no ROI form or formal request process is linked from the portal page.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are dual-purpose: their title explicitly covers both "Patient Access" and "Use and Disclosure." Section 4 includes dedicated checkboxes for patient inspection or copies, alongside a third-party release authorization line. This is a modest positive — the form acknowledges patient self-access as a use case rather than treating it as an afterthought. However, the form is fundamentally a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all release purposes, not a dedicated patient access form. A Cuba Memorial patient must also contend with the fact that neither form mentions their hospital by name, creating real confusion about which form to use and where to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was moderately difficult. Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website has no medical records page, no patient forms section, and no downloadable ROI form. Multiple search strategies — including site-specific searches, direct navigation, and sitemap review — yielded nothing. The forms were only discovered by following a small footer link from Cuba Memorial's site to the BRMC-OGH website, then navigating to the medical records page. A patient would need to recognize this footer link as relevant, navigate a different organization's site, and infer that the "OGH" form applies to their Cuba Memorial records — a non-obvious multi-step process.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are 2-page, digitally produced PDFs with text layers — not scans. However, neither has fillable fields (fillable_field_count: 0). Patients must print and complete them by hand. The forms use a numbered seven-section structure (authorization statement, disclosing organization, record types, recipient/patient access, patient rights, expiration, specially protected information) that provides reasonable organization. Approximately 15 fields require completion for a patient self-access request.

The language is moderately legalistic but generally comprehensible. Patient rights statements in Section 5 cover voluntariness, no treatment impact, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, and right to copies. However, a typo in Section 5(c) — "but in do" instead of "but if I do" — has persisted across both forms since at least 2017, suggesting the templates are unmaintained.

## Barriers

- **No clear submission pathway**: The forms provide no instructions for how to submit them. The bolded statement "Photo ID is required for records to be picked up" implies in-person pickup as the expected or only delivery method. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or online submission option is mentioned on the form or the BRMC-OGH medical records page.
- **Witness lines**: Dedicated witness signature lines appear without indication of whether witnessing is required or optional, potentially deterring patients from submitting unwitnessed forms.
- **90-day expiration**: Authorization expires after 90 days, which is unnecessary for patient access requests under HIPAA's ongoing right of access.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) mentions "a reasonable copy fee" with no specifics or fee schedule reference.
- **Outdated forms**: Both forms were last revised in January 2017, predating Information Blocking rules and 21st Century Cures Act implementation.

## Strengths

- The form explicitly contemplates patient self-access with dedicated inspection/copies checkboxes — relatively uncommon among generic authorization forms.
- Granular record type selection (11 categories with date ranges) gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.
- Appropriate handling of specially protected information (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) with separate consent checkboxes consistent with New York law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Overall Assessment

Cuba Memorial Hospital presents significant access challenges for patients seeking their own records online. The hospital publishes no form of its own, requiring patients to navigate to an affiliated organization's website and use a form branded for a different hospital. The forms themselves, while structurally adequate and notably inclusive of patient self-access checkboxes, are non-fillable, outdated, and provide no guidance on submission or delivery methods. The implied requirement for in-person pickup with photo ID — potentially at a facility 30+ miles away — represents a meaningful barrier for a rural critical access hospital population. The overall experience falls short of patient-centered design, earning a grade of C.

# Lexington Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Lexington Medical Center (West Columbia, SC) publishes three documents on its Medical Records page at lexhealth.com/medical-records: an English-language "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (form-1), a full Spanish translation of the same form (form-2), and a supplemental Reproductive Health Attestation form (form-3) implementing the 2024 HIPAA privacy rule. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a two-page general-purpose ROI authorization. The website also mentions MyChart as a digital option for records requests, though that portal-based pathway was not directly evaluated.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lexington Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic authorization: "I authorize the following provider/entity _____ to release my health information to: Recipient/Provider Name: _____." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly designate themselves as both the authorizer and the recipient — an unintuitive workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no separate patient access form, and no language explaining that patients have a legal right to obtain their own records. The form funnels all requests — whether to insurers, attorneys, family members, or the patient themselves — through the same third-party release authorization framework.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which links directly to all three PDFs. No bot blocking, no JavaScript rendering issues, and no portal login was required. The Medical Records page provides context for both digital (MyChart) and paper-based requests. This is a well-organized web presence for records access information.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a digitally-authored, text-based PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores and all checkboxes are non-interactive symbol characters. Patients must print and complete the form by hand. The layout is well-organized into three clear sections: patient identification and routing, medical records release details with a granular record-type checklist (~25 categories), and review/authorization terms with a signature block. At two pages, the length is appropriate. Language is moderately formal — not impenetrable legalese, but not plain language either. The authorization conditions (Section 3) use standard legal register that most adults could follow with careful reading.

Submission is limited on the form itself: the only method stated is postal mail ("Mail completed form to: Lexington Health Attn: Medical Records, 2720 Sunset Blvd."). However, Condition 6 states that "a copy or fax of this document is just as valid as the original document," implying fax submission would be accepted, though no fax number is provided for the records department. The website separately references MyChart for digital requests.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness signature** is required — a welcome absence. The form also explicitly accepts copies and faxes as valid. However, there are notable concerns:

- **Full SSN collection**: The form requests the patient's complete Social Security Number as a top-level identifier, which is unnecessary for HIPAA purposes and creates identity theft risk on a document designed to be mailed.
- **Blanket substance abuse/psychiatric disclosure**: Condition 1 states that alcohol abuse, psychiatric, drug abuse, and communicable disease records "will be released" with no opt-out, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records.
- **Undisclosed fees**: Patients are told "there may be a charge" and must call (803) 791-2264 to learn the amount — no upfront fee transparency.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires in 90 days, which is short but generally adequate for a single records request.

## Notable Strengths

The **Spanish-language version** (form-2) is a full professional translation co-located with the English form — not buried in a separate section. It uniquely includes an interpreter services phone number with conference call instructions, a thoughtful accessibility touch. The **granular record-type checklist** gives patients meaningful control over what gets released. The **Reproductive Health Attestation** (form-3) demonstrates proactive compliance with recent HIPAA regulatory changes, ahead of many peer organizations.

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Medical Center makes its forms easy to find and offers a well-organized, bilingual paper-based workflow. However, the process fundamentally treats patient self-access as indistinguishable from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a generic authorization form not designed for their needs. The non-fillable PDF and mail-only submission (on the form itself) create unnecessary friction in an era of digital health records. The SSN collection and blanket substance abuse disclosure represent compliance concerns. The organization earns credit for findability, bilingual access, and clear layout, but falls short on patient-centeredness and technical accessibility.

# Huntington Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Huntington Hospital, a community hospital in Huntington, NY, is part of the Northwell Health system and uses Northwell's system-wide forms for all records requests. Four documents were retrieved: a general third-party Authorization for Release of Health Information (form-1) with companion instructions (form-2), and a dedicated patient-specific Request for Access form (form-3) with its own companion instructions (form-4). The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-3**, the "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative."

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Access Form

Northwell Health distinguishes itself by maintaining **two separate form types**: one for third-party release (form-1) and one specifically for patient self-access (form-3). This two-form architecture is uncommon among healthcare organizations and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to HIPAA compliance. Form-3 opens with an explicit citation of HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524, informing patients of their right of access, and presents "To me" as the first recipient option — signaling that patient self-access is the primary use case, not an afterthought.

However, there is a notable gap: form-1 (the third-party release form) contains **no cross-reference** to form-3. A patient who encounters the general authorization first would have no indication that a separate, more appropriate form exists for their self-access request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. All four documents are directly linked from the Northwell Health medical records page at northwell.edu. The main friction point was search disambiguation — "Huntington Hospital" also refers to a facility in California, requiring "Northwell" to be added to queries. No facility-specific forms exist at huntington.northwell.edu; patients must navigate to the parent system site. URLs are descriptive (e.g., `request-for-access-to-health-information-form-english-2022.pdf`), and the filename's "english" suffix hints at a multilingual intent, though no non-English versions were found during retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a strong document. At **2 pages with 28 fillable fields**, it is a genuinely interactive PDF that patients can complete digitally without printing. The layout follows a logical numbered structure: patient demographics, source facility, recipient, delivery method/format matrix, record type selection, substance use/HIV consent section, and signature block. The delivery options are notably comprehensive — mail, facility pickup, secure email, unsecure email (with explicit risk acknowledgment), fax, USB flash drive, and CD.

The language is generally accessible, using informal parenthetical labels like "(From Who)" that prioritize clarity over grammatical precision. The companion instruction document (form-4) provides step-by-step guidance with concrete examples ("Jane Patient," "Dr. Jane Jones at 300 Northwell Drive"), which is a genuine accessibility aid.

The form does have minor weaknesses: the delivery method matrix with nested checkboxes requires careful reading, and the witness signature line is ambiguous — it doesn't state whether a witness is required or optional, which could create a perceived barrier.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and does not mandate in-person submission. The expiration field applies only to substance use disorder and HIV records (consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 and NY law), not to the general access request — a correct implementation. No fees are disclosed, which avoids discouragement but leaves patients without cost visibility.

The most significant gap is the **absence of submission instructions**. Neither form-3 nor its instructions (form-4) specify where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link is provided. A patient could fill out the form perfectly and still not know what to do with it. This is a systemic gap across all four Northwell documents.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation — rare among healthcare organizations
- **28 fillable fields** enabling fully digital completion
- **Companion instruction documents** with annotated visual examples — genuinely helpful and uncommon
- **Comprehensive delivery format options** including USB flash drive and secure/unsecure email with informed consent

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No submission instructions** on any form or instruction document
- **No cross-reference** between the third-party form (form-1) and patient access form (form-3)
- **Witness line ambiguity** may deter patients who assume a witness is mandatory
- **Third-party form (form-1) lacks fillable fields** despite patient access form having 28 — inconsistent modernization

## Overall Assessment

Huntington Hospital, through its parent system Northwell Health, provides an above-average patient access experience. The dedicated patient access form with HIPAA citation, fillable fields, comprehensive delivery options, and companion instructions represent genuine investment in patient-centered design. The primary gaps — missing submission instructions and lack of cross-referencing between forms — are meaningful but do not fundamentally obstruct access. This organization earns a **B grade**, reflecting strong patient-centeredness and good document quality with room for improvement in workflow completeness.

# Synthesis: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital

## Overview

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital in Murfreesboro, TN is part of Ascension, the largest nonprofit Catholic health system in the U.S. For medical records requests, the hospital relies on two pathways: a **Swellbox-based online request wizard** (the primary pathway linked from the patient portal page) and a **downloadable PDF authorization form** (STHS490) shared across the entire Ascension Saint Thomas system in Tennessee. Only the PDF form was available for detailed evaluation. No dedicated patient access request form was found — the single PDF serves both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information at the form level. The PDF form (STHS490) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Disclosure of PHI" that handles both use cases through a single "and/or" construction: patients can check "Use my health information" and/or "Disclose my health information to the following individual or organization." A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same form — including specifying themselves as the recipient — as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), the 30-day response obligation, or patient-specific fee limits.

However, the existence of the **Swellbox online wizard** as the primary pathway is significant. Though we could not evaluate the wizard's internal design, the fact that patients are directed to an online request tool — rather than solely to a downloadable PDF — suggests a more modern and potentially more patient-friendly experience as the default path. This partially mitigates the generic nature of the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form was **easy**. A targeted Google search on the second attempt returned a direct link. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or browser fallback was needed. The form is hosted on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure (the URL path includes "legacy"), suggesting it predates the current website architecture and is discoverable primarily via search engines rather than site navigation. The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, is linked from the patient portal page via normal site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF form (STHS490) is a **single page** — concise and complete. It uses a numbered structure (items 1–7) with a logical flow from patient identification through record type selection, rights notice, and signature. The record type checklist (ten options plus "Other") gives patients meaningful control over scope. Contact phone numbers for all eight Saint Thomas facilities are listed, which is helpful.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. The layout is dense, with small fonts (likely 8–9pt in places) cramming all content onto one page. Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese, particularly in the revocation clause (item 5). There are no separate instructions, no multilingual versions, and no plain-language summary of patient rights.

The form offers **mail and email delivery** checkboxes (item 7), which is better than forms limited to mail or in-person pickup. Combined with the Swellbox wizard for online submission, a patient has viable electronic pathways available.

## Barriers

The most notable barrier is the **SSN field combined with "ALL BLANKS MUST BE COMPLETED"** — implying SSN is mandatory. HIPAA does not require SSN for a records authorization, and requiring it creates both a privacy risk and a potential deterrent. The form also uses stale branding ("Saint Thomas Health" in body text vs. "Ascension Saint Thomas" in footer) and has a filename/form number mismatch (sths409 vs. STHS490), which are minor but erode trust in document currency.

No notarization or witness is required. No fees are mentioned on the form. The six-month default expiration is reasonable.

## Strengths

- **Online alternative (Swellbox wizard)** as the primary pathway
- **Email delivery option** on the PDF form
- **Granular record type checklist** with helpful descriptions
- **HIM contact numbers** for all facilities listed directly on the form
- **Easy findability** — no search difficulties

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox online wizard as the primary pathway is a meaningful strength that elevates the organization above those relying solely on PDF forms. However, the PDF form itself — the only document available for detailed evaluation — is a generic third-party authorization form with no fillable fields, an implied SSN requirement, and no acknowledgment of patient self-access as a distinct right. The organization earns credit for offering electronic pathways but falls short on patient-centeredness and form document quality.

# Labette Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Labette Health is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Parsons, Kansas. It takes a notably digital-first approach to medical records requests: rather than offering a downloadable PDF authorization form, it routes patients to an **online Formstack form** accessible directly from the main website navigation. This places Labette Health ahead of many peers who still rely on print-and-mail PDF workflows.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents were downloaded during the search, but **neither is Labette Health's actual ROI form**:

- **form-1.pdf** — A generic one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" template from PatientPop, hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It does not mention Labette Health anywhere and surfaced only as a misleading search result. It has no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and is missing core HIPAA authorization elements.
- **form-2.pdf** — Labette Health's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), effective November 2021. This is an informational compliance document, not a request mechanism. It does reference the right to inspect and copy records and the right to an electronic copy, but does not link to the actual request form.

The **primary and only pathway** for requesting records is the Formstack online form at `https://labetteheatlh.formstack.com/forms/medical_records_request` (note: the subdomain contains a typo — "labetteheatlh" instead of "labettehealth"). The Contact Us page also mentions visiting the office in person as an alternative.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Labette Health's Formstack form **does differentiate** between patient self-access and third-party release. It includes a "Release direction" field with "to Patient/Self" as an explicit option alongside "Other," and a "Relationship to patient" field that includes "Patient/Self" as the first choice. While it is a single form serving multiple purposes rather than a dedicated patient-only form, the self-access pathway is clearly accommodated — a patient does not need to guess which parts apply to them.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating the website directly; standard web searches returned only the irrelevant PatientPop template. The website blocks simple HTTP fetches (returns 403), necessitating browser-based navigation. However, once on the site, the form is **easy to find**: the main navigation under "Patients & visitors" contains a direct "Medical records request form" link. The Contact Us page also links to it. Overall retrieval difficulty is **moderate** — the form is well-placed on the website but invisible to search engines and requires browser access.

## Form Document Quality

The Formstack form is a strong digital-first implementation:

- **Fully interactive**: All fields are fillable online with no printing required
- **Electronic signature**: Includes a signature pad for digital signing
- **Comprehensive record types**: 15+ specific checkboxes (COVID-19, Abstract, Clinic Note, Discharge Summary, EKG/Stress Test, ER Record, H&P, Lab Results, Operative Report, Radiology CD/Report, Sleep Study, Vaccination History, etc.)
- **Date range**: Includes date(s) of service field
- **Email delivery**: Offers an email delivery option for receiving records
- **Photo ID upload**: Built-in identity verification via file upload
- **Sensitive information**: Explicit exclusion options for mental health, communicable diseases, and drug/alcohol records
- **HIPAA language**: Standard authorization language including 1-year expiration, right to revoke, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warning

The layout is structured with clear sections and the field count (~15-20 fields) is reasonable for a comprehensive records request.

## Barriers and Compliance

No unnecessary barriers were identified. There is no notarization requirement, no witness requirement, and no mandatory in-person submission. The form submits electronically upon completion. The NPP mentions that copies may incur a "reasonable fee" but provides no specific amounts — this is standard HIPAA language but leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **Digital-first, no-paper workflow**: Among the most modern approaches observed for a community hospital of this size
- **Patient self-access clearly supported**: "Patient/Self" is an explicit option, not an afterthought
- **Comprehensive NPP**: Includes an unusually detailed Kansas HIT/HIO section and complete Privacy Officer contact information (name, address, phone, email)
- **Email delivery option**: Patients can request records via email, going beyond the typical CD or paper delivery

## Weaknesses and Concerns

- **URL typo**: The Formstack subdomain "labetteheatlh" (missing an "h") is fragile — if corrected upstream, existing links would break
- **No PDF alternative**: Patients without reliable internet access have no downloadable form option (only in-person office visit)
- **NPP doesn't link to the form**: The NPP tells patients to "complete a specific form" to exercise access rights but never identifies which form or where to find it
- **Website blocks automated access**: 403 errors on HTTP fetches could impact accessibility tools or screen readers that rely on direct URL access

## Overall Assessment

Labette Health provides a genuinely patient-centered, digital-first records request experience that stands out for an independent community hospital. The Formstack form is well-designed, comprehensive, and clearly accommodates patient self-access. The main gaps are the lack of a PDF fallback, the URL typo, and the disconnect between the NPP and the actual request mechanism. Overall, this organization earns a **B grade** — above average in technical accessibility and patient-centeredness, with minor findability and disclosure gaps preventing a top score.

# Columbia Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbia Memorial Hospital (CMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Astoria, Oregon. Two ROI forms were found: an English-language "Release of Information" form (HIPAA Form 3B, revised February 2025) and a Spanish translation (HIPAA Form 3Bsp, revised August 2017). Both are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms — the hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access request form distinct from third-party release authorization.

## Access Pathway

CMH funnels all record requests — whether from patients seeking their own records or third parties — through a single generic ROI authorization form. The form's "Purpose" checkboxes (Continuing Care, Insurance, Legal, Other) do not include "Personal use" or "Patient access," forcing a patient requesting their own records to select "Other" and write in a reason. The bidirectional design (Section C has both "Send Records To" and "Request Records From" fields) further signals that this form was designed for inter-facility transfers, not individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The hospital does offer a patient portal (myCMH) for partial record access, but the primary written pathway for requesting complete records is this generic ROI form. There is no evidence of a dedicated patient access request process that distinguishes individual rights from third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page at `columbiamemorial.org/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/` links directly to both the English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative search strategies were needed — basic website navigation sufficed. The page also prominently states that "Records are free to patients who request their records," which is a notable positive signal adjacent to the form links.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a cleanly structured 2-page PDF with five labeled sections (A through E). Page 1 is the patient-facing authorization; page 2 is for hospital administrative use only. The layout is logical and navigable, with clear section headers and a well-organized record-type checklist offering 11 specific categories (Emergency Room, Lab Reports, Imaging, etc.) each with a date-of-service field.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). All data entry relies on printed blank lines, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the PDF was clearly created in a layout tool capable of adding interactive fields.

The language is generally plain and accessible. The opening purpose statement ("This form is an authorization to release protected health information") is clear and direct. The signature block language is standard without excessive legalese. There are no instructions or guidance text beyond the section labels, and no statement of patient rights beyond the required notice about entitlement to a copy of the signed authorization.

Submission methods are not explicitly stated on the form itself, though the header lists both a phone number and fax number. The page 2 hospital-use section tracks delivery via "Pt. Pick-Up," "Mailed," "Faxed," and "Electronic" — but these are staff-facing fields, not patient-facing options. A patient filling out the form independently would have to infer that faxing is acceptable.

## Barriers and Compliance

CMH demonstrates several positive practices: no notarization or witness requirement, no in-person mandate, and an explicit commitment to free records for patient access (stated on the website, though not on the form itself). Processing time is stated as 72–96 business hours.

The primary compliance concern is the absence of explicit expiration date/event language and revocation instructions in the form text — elements required by HIPAA § 164.508(c)(1)(v) for valid authorizations. Additionally, the form includes no reference to patient rights under HIPAA, no information about fees on the form itself, and no delivery format options for the patient.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Bilingual form availability (English and Spanish) is uncommon, especially for a small rural critical access hospital, and demonstrates attention to community language needs. The explicit "records are free" statement is exemplary transparency. The well-organized section structure makes the form more navigable than many single-block authorization forms.

**Red flags:** The Spanish form is nearly 8 years older than the English version (2017 vs. 2025), creating a risk that Spanish-speaking patients encounter outdated language or missing sections. Page 2 of the Spanish form is entirely untranslated. The form's missing expiration/revocation language may render signed authorizations technically non-compliant.

## Overall Assessment

Columbia Memorial Hospital provides a reasonably accessible, well-organized ROI process with commendable bilingual availability and fee transparency. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and gaps in compliance language prevent it from achieving the highest marks. A patient can get their records here without unreasonable barriers, but the process was not designed with the individual access use case as a priority.

# The Baton Rouge Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

The Baton Rouge Clinic maintains three distinct medical records forms on a well-organized "Downloadable Forms" page: (1) an outbound release authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information FROM The Baton Rouge Clinic"), (2) an inbound transfer authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information TO The Baton Rouge Clinic"), and (3) a "Right of Access Form" citing HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 164.524. This three-form strategy shows unusual thoughtfulness — the clinic has differentiated between outbound third-party release, inbound records transfer, and patient-directed access, which is more than most organizations offer.

## Patient Self-Access Pathway

The Right of Access form (form-3) is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. At just one page and ~1,300 characters, it is admirably concise compared to the two-page authorization forms. It explicitly cites HIPAA Right of Access authority and offers a choice between electronic and hard copy delivery — a genuine bright spot that many organizations lack.

However, the form has a meaningful design flaw: it is framed entirely as a designee authorization, directing providers to disclose records "to: Name: ___." There is no clear option for a patient to request records for themselves; a patient wanting their own records would need to awkwardly write their own name in the recipient field. The form that most directly invokes the Right of Access isn't actually designed for the most common Right of Access use case — patient self-request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search immediately returned direct PDF links to the authorization forms. All three forms were hosted on a well-organized downloadable forms page at `batonrougeclinic.com/patient-information/downloadable-forms/` with no login, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering required. The one findability gap: the Right of Access form (form-3) was not surfaced by the initial web search and was only discovered by browsing the forms page directly. A patient searching specifically for "how to request my records" might land on the third-party release form instead.

## Form Document Quality

All three forms are flat PDFs with zero fillable fields, despite having clean text layers (not scans). Every form requires printing and hand-filling — a significant accessibility gap, particularly ironic for form-3, which explicitly offers electronic record delivery while requiring a paper submission process. Form-3 has a clean, simple layout with logical flow (patient name → designee → scope → format → duration → signature). The language is relatively plain and accessible. Form-1 uses an asterisk system to mark required fields, which is helpful, though it also requires a Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection burden that form-3 wisely avoids.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. None of the forms disclose fees or state response times. Form-1 includes a hold-harmless clause that goes beyond HIPAA requirements, though form-3 omits this — a more patient-friendly approach. Submission methods are poorly documented: form-1 provides a medical records email (medrecords@brclinic.com) and phone number for questions and urgent requests, but no form explicitly states how to submit the completed document. No fax number is provided. The mailing address appears in footers. A patient completing form-3 has no guidance on where or how to send it.

## Overall Assessment

The Baton Rouge Clinic demonstrates above-average organizational thinking about patient access — the three-form strategy and HIPAA Right of Access citation reflect genuine awareness of different use cases. The Right of Access form's conciseness and electronic delivery option are bright spots. However, the execution falls short in key areas: all forms lack fillable fields, submission pathways are unclear, and the Right of Access form's designee-only framing creates a confusing gap for patients seeking their own records. The clinic has the right structure but needs better implementation — fillable fields, explicit submission instructions, and a self-access option on the Right of Access form would substantially improve the patient experience.

# Piedmont Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Piedmont Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Rock Hill, SC, affiliated with Tenet Healthcare. Two authorization forms were found: a one-page hospital-specific form (form-1) and a two-page physician network form (form-2). The organization also contracts with Datavant and offers Swellbox online portals for both patient and provider record requests, which represents the most patient-friendly pathway.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The hospital's "Request Medical Records" page at piedmontmedicalcenter.com/patients/request-medical-records serves as the central hub, linking to: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (form-1), and (2) a Swellbox/Datavant online portal for patient record requests. A second PDF form (form-2) exists on the affiliated Piedmont Physician Network website but is not linked from the hospital's main medical records page.

Form-1 is the primary PDF document for hospital record requests. It is a single-page "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" form (EZ-7003, revised 2013). The Swellbox portal, however, is likely the pathway the organization most actively directs patients toward for digital submission.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither PDF form is a dedicated patient-access form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 does include a "Self" checkbox under the PURPOSE section, acknowledging that a patient may be requesting their own records, but the form's framing ("I authorize Piedmont Medical Center to disclose the following information...") and structure assume a third-party recipient scenario. Form-2 is even more clearly a third-party release form, with fields for "Name of Person or Class of Persons who may disclose" and "To release records to" — a structure that makes no sense for self-access.

The Swellbox portal provides a meaningful alternative. By offering separate portals for patient and provider requests, the organization does create some differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — though this differentiation exists at the portal level, not in the PDF forms themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately returned the medical records page URL and direct PDF links. The medical records page is well-organized and clearly labeled. The only technical hurdle was Cloudflare bot protection blocking automated downloads, requiring browser-based retrieval — a hosting infrastructure issue that could also affect assistive technologies.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1** (primary hospital form) is a non-fillable PDF with zero interactive fields. Despite having labeled fields for patient name, date of birth, address, and various checkboxes for record types, all are static text requiring print-and-fill completion. The form is compact at one page with a logical layout organized into PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION REQUESTED, PURPOSE, and INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO sections. Record type options are granular, with 14+ checkboxes covering specific document types plus a write-in option.

The language is moderately legalistic, particularly the liability release and re-disclosure clauses. Template merge fields (`«PatientNumberBarcode»`, `«PatientName»`, etc.) are visible at the bottom of the public PDF, indicating an unprocessed template extracted from the hospital's document management system — confusing for patients and unprofessional in appearance. A typo ("in ability" for "inability") in the legal representative attestation is concerning for a legal document.

**Form-2** (physician network form) is more comprehensive at two pages but also entirely non-fillable. Its standout feature is granular opt-in checkboxes for seven categories of highly confidential information (mental health, psychotherapy notes, HIV/AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, sexual assault, child abuse/neglect). However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, carries no organizational branding, has a date field locked to "200_" (rendering one term option unusable since 2010), and provides no Privacy Office contact information.

## Barriers and Compliance

Neither form requires notarization or in-person submission. Neither mentions fees. Both include standard HIPAA disclosures: revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warnings. Form-1's six-month default expiration is reasonable. The liability release clause on Form-1 — releasing the hospital "from any legal responsibility or liability" — is unnecessary for patient self-access and could discourage patients from exercising their rights. Both forms are notably outdated (2013 and pre-2010 respectively), predating significant regulatory updates.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** for patient record requests provides a modern digital pathway beyond the paper forms
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear organization and multiple access options
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** (14+ options on form-1) give patients meaningful control
- **Granular sensitive information opt-in** on form-2 (seven separate categories) represents strong practice

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — both PDFs are generic third-party authorization forms
- **Zero fillable fields** on either form — entirely print-and-fill
- **Severely outdated forms** (one from 2013, one from pre-2010)
- **Visible template merge fields** on form-1 indicate an unprocessed internal template
- **SSN requested** on form-2 (unnecessary privacy risk)
- **Liability release clause** on form-1 (inappropriate for patient self-access)

## Overall Assessment

Piedmont Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional patient records request experience. The organization's investment in a Swellbox/Datavant online portal significantly improves the digital pathway, compensating for PDF forms that are entirely paper-oriented and outdated. The medical records page is easy to find and well-organized. However, the underlying PDF forms show their age — neither has been updated in over a decade, neither offers fillable fields, and neither is designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. The organization earns a B grade, buoyed by the portal alternative and reasonable findability, but held back by paper-era form design and a generic authorization approach that doesn't center patient access rights.

# University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two versions of the same form were found: **Form 1989 ("ADMIN – Consent to Release of Information and Right of Access Request")**. Form-1 is the current official version (revised May 2024), hosted on the university's healthcare domain. Form-2 is an older revision (August 2021) hosted on a third-party CDN, pre-populated for a driving rehabilitation service ("Safer Driver Solutions"). Form-1 is the canonical, patient-facing document; form-2 is irrelevant for direct patient self-access and is included only for completeness.

The organization directs patients to a clear medical records request page at `uihc.org/medical-records-request`, which links to the PDF form and provides submission instructions. Submission options include email (`him-consentform@uiowa.edu`), fax (two numbers), and physical mail — a notably flexible set of channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form title explicitly names both functions: "Consent to Release of Information **AND** Right of Access Request." This dual-purpose naming is unusual and shows awareness that patients may exercise their HIPAA right of access. However, the form body does not differentiate the two use cases. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no separate workflow, and — critically — no "send records to myself" shortcut. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Send UI Health Care information to" field, effectively treating themselves as a third party. Ironically, the older form-2 included a "Myself at the address above unless noted below" option, which the current revision dropped.

The organization does not distinguish between individual access requests (governed by HIPAA § 164.524) and third-party authorization (governed by § 164.508) in its process or documentation. This is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that acknowledges patient access in name only.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF link. The official medical records page provides clear context and instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, CAPTCHAs, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, natively digital PDF with a clean text layer (4,233 characters). Despite being digitally created, it has **zero fillable fields** — a significant regression from the older form-2, which had 50 fillable fields. Patients must print the form, complete it by hand, scan it, and then submit electronically (email or fax) or by mail. The form's consent language acknowledges electronic completion ("as valid as if you signed the consent in writing"), creating a paradox: the form claims to support electronic completion but provides no interactive fields to enable it.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient → format options → record types → date range → reason → consent → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Sections are spatially separated but lack labeled headers. The language is generally clear, though the consent block contains moderately dense legal prose. Record type options are comprehensive (16+ checkboxes), and the form thoughtfully includes legacy entity lines for patients who received care under prior organizational names (Corridor OB GYN, Mercy Clinics, Mercy Hospital).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states a 30-day response commitment, aligning with HIPAA requirements. The non-conditioning statement is present and properly worded. Fee disclosure is vague: "I understand there may be a charge for this information" — without distinguishing between patient access fees (limited under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. Revocation requires written notification to the Director of Health Information Management, a minor but unnecessary barrier.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Exceptional findability. Multiple electronic submission channels including email. Dual-purpose form title acknowledging right of access. Legacy entity lines accommodating merged organizations. Comprehensive record type selection. Five delivery format options including electronic media (CD, USB, email).

**Red flags**: The current official form regressed from 50 fillable fields to zero — a clear step backward in digital accessibility. The removal of the "Myself" recipient option from the current form makes patient self-access less intuitive than in the older version. Vague fee language fails to inform patients of their right to cost-based fees under HIPAA.

## Overall Assessment

University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics earns credit for excellent findability, multiple submission channels, and a form that at least names patient access in its title. However, the lack of fillable fields on the current form, the absence of a differentiated patient self-access pathway, and the regression from the more interactive older version weigh against it. The organization provides an adequate but not patient-centered experience — a patient can get their records, but must navigate a form designed primarily for third-party authorization using a print-and-fill workflow.

# El Centro de Corazón — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

El Centro de Corazón is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Houston, Texas. It offers a single downloadable PDF form for health information disclosure — a bilingual (English/Spanish) "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information." This form is the only pathway available for patients seeking their own medical records, and it is oriented entirely toward third-party release of information rather than patient self-access.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page authorization for disclosure hosted on the organization's WordPress site. Page 1 is in English, page 2 is a Spanish translation. No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified. The form's fax number (713-926-9105) is printed on the document, suggesting fax is an accepted submission method, though this is not explicitly stated as a submission instruction. No email, portal, or other electronic submission options are mentioned.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

El Centro de Corazón does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses a "provide to / receive from (circle one)" structure that presumes records flow between El Centro and another entity. There is no "send records to me, the patient" option. Among the nine reason-for-disclosure checkboxes (Continuing of Care, Financial Insurance Verification, Legal Proceedings, etc.), none corresponds to "personal/patient request." A patient wanting their own records must use the "Other (Specify)" write-in, which is unintuitive and signals that patient self-access was not a design consideration.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), does not include any patient rights language, and does not ask how the patient would like to receive their records (mail, electronic, in-person pickup). This is a generic HIPAA authorization form pressed into service for all disclosure scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned a direct link to the PDF on El Centro's WordPress site. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication was encountered. The URL structure (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/...`) is a standard WordPress media path — functional but not linked from a clearly labeled "Medical Records" or "Patient Resources" page. The form appears to date from August 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive form fields). It must be printed and completed by hand — the design uses underscore-line blanks and a "circle one" instruction that are hallmarks of print-era forms. The text layer is present (not a scan), so the content is readable and searchable, but there is no digital-first workflow available.

**Field count** is modest: patient name, DOB, phone number, the other party's information, reason checkboxes, information-type checkboxes, a sensitive-information acknowledgment, and signature/date fields — roughly 12–15 fields per language. At one page per language, the form is compact and not overwhelming.

**Layout** is functional but dense. Section headers are minimal; the form flows as a single block of content. Language is relatively plain, though legal constructs appear ("I hereby authorize"). A grammatical error exists in both versions regarding re-disclosure language.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Witness signature line**: Present on both English and Spanish versions. HIPAA does not require a witness for authorization forms. While the line appears optional (no mandatory language), its presence may lead staff to enforce it as required, creating an unnecessary barrier.
- **Fee disclosure**: Vague — "I understand that I may be charged for the copies of health records I have requested" — with no specifics about amounts, HIPAA cost-based limits, or dispute processes.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization defaults to 90 days, which is reasonable for third-party disclosures but irrelevant for patient access requests (which must be fulfilled within 30 days).
- **No delivery format options**: The form does not ask how the patient wants to receive records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual (English/Spanish)**: Providing a full Spanish translation on the same document is a meaningful accessibility feature for an FQHC serving Houston's predominantly Spanish-speaking communities. This is uncommon and commendable.
- **Compact design**: One page per language avoids the multi-page complexity that discourages completion.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient self-access pathway**: The form's entire structure is oriented toward third-party disclosure. A patient exercising their Right of Access is a second-class user.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive fields; purely a print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Checkbox mismatch**: The Spanish version omits "Billing Records" as a checkbox option, creating a translation inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

El Centro de Corazón provides a findable, compact, bilingual form — but it is a generic third-party authorization that does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The non-fillable format, lack of patient rights language, ambiguous witness requirement, and vague fee disclosure all contribute to a below-average patient experience. The bilingual design is a genuine bright spot that partially offsets the form's structural shortcomings.

# UAB Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UAB Hospital (UAB Medicine), a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, provides one of the clearer patient record request experiences encountered in this study. The organization maintains a dedicated medical records request page that explicitly separates patient self-access from third-party release, offering distinct downloadable PDF forms for each pathway. Three forms were retrieved: a patient self-access form (form-1), a Callahan Eye Hospital variant (form-2), and a third-party authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

UAB Medicine stands out by offering a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-1, "Patient Request for Own Medical Records") that is clearly differentiated from its third-party authorization form (form-3). The patient access form opens with an explicit rights-affirming statement: *"UAB Medicine recognizes a patient's right to access their own protected health information."* The medical records request page at `uabmedicine.org/pay-your-bill/medical-records-request/` routes patients to the correct form based on their need — self-access versus third-party disclosure — with separate download links. This is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the UAB Medicine website clearly organizes its medical records page. The patient access form has a descriptive URL and filename (`Patient-Request-own-medical-records.pdf`), making it identifiable even in search results. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Quality: The Primary Patient Access Form (Form-1)

Form-1 is a 2-page fillable PDF with **51 interactive form fields**, clean text extraction, and a logical layout. The form is structured into clear sections: patient demographics, recipient designation, sensitive records opt-in, date range, record package selection, delivery method, and signature. The language is generally plain and direct, though the tiered package system requires some cognitive effort to parse.

A standout feature is the **five-tier record package system**, offering graduated levels of detail from key clinical notes through the entire medical record. This gives patients meaningful control over scope rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice. Additionally, nine individual record-type checkboxes allow specific requests (operative reports, billing records, medication list, radiology images, etc.).

**Delivery options** are comprehensive: paper mail, in-person pickup, fax, CD, and email. Electronic delivery includes a clear notice about encryption and privacy. For form submission, patients can return the completed form by mail or **fax (205-930-6721)**, providing an adequate electronic submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no notarization or witness requirements. No in-person submission is required. There are no excessive procedural hurdles — a patient signs once and does not need to initial multiple clauses (unlike form-2's three-initial requirement). However, **fees are not mentioned at all** — neither confirming free patient access nor disclosing a fee schedule. This silence creates ambiguity for patients who may reasonably want to know costs upfront. Similarly, **no turnaround time** is stated.

One ambiguity warrants mention: the form asks patients whether to include psychiatric/substance use records (opt-in checkbox on page 1) but then includes blanket authorization language covering those same records in the signature block on page 2, creating a potential contradiction.

## Contextual Notes on Other Forms

Form-2 (Callahan Eye Hospital variant) serves the same self-access function but is notably inferior: it has **zero fillable fields**, requires print-and-handwrite completion, and is 3 pages despite offering less content (2 record packages versus 5). Its title conflates "Patient Access" with "Authorization for Use or Disclosure," and it omits the rights-affirming opening statement present in form-1. It also contains a pagination error ("Page 3/2"). However, the high-watermark principle means UAB is assessed based on form-1, not this weaker variant.

Form-3 is correctly scoped as a third-party authorization and is appropriately separate from the patient access pathway. Its text layer is completely garbled due to CID font encoding issues, creating accessibility barriers, but this does not affect the patient self-access assessment.

## Overall Assessment

UAB Hospital delivers an above-average patient record request experience. The dedicated patient self-access form with rights-affirming language, fillable fields, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options — combined with a well-organized website that clearly separates patient access from third-party release — places this organization among the better performers. The primary gaps are the absence of fee disclosure and turnaround time information. The form is not cutting-edge (no online portal or digital submission), but the fillable PDF with fax submission represents a solid, accessible workflow.
