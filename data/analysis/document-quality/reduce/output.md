# Document Quality Across the ROI Form Landscape

## The Typical ROI Form: A Portrait

The median Release of Information form in this study is a **one-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF with approximately 20 fields, in English only, without instructions, structured as a generic third-party authorization**. It was created digitally — in a word processor or layout tool, with a clean text layer — but exported without interactive form fields, forcing patients into a print → handwrite → scan/fax workflow that negates its digital origins.

This is the central paradox of the ROI form landscape: the vast majority of forms are born-digital documents trapped in paper-era workflows. Organizations have the tools to produce fillable, accessible PDFs. They simply don't.

## Aggregate Counts: Format and Fillability

Across 190 scored organizations, forms divide into three tiers:

- **Fillable/interactive PDFs**: 50 organizations (26%) provide forms with working fillable fields — text inputs, checkboxes, or dropdowns that patients can complete on-screen.
- **Flat digital PDFs (print-and-fill)**: Roughly 110 organizations (58%) publish born-digital PDFs with zero fillable fields. These are digitally created, properly text-layered documents that nonetheless require printing and handwriting.
- **Image-only scans**: About 25 organizations (13%) serve scanned paper forms — grayscale or black-and-white images with no text layer, no searchability, and no accessibility support.
- **No form found**: 5 organizations (3%) publish no downloadable ROI form at all, leaving patients with no clear starting point for exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

Nearly three-quarters of all organizations offer no digital completion pathway whatsoever. The fillable-form rate of 26% means that for every patient who can type into their authorization form on-screen, roughly three others must locate a printer, find a pen, and figure out how to return a physical document.

## Page Counts and Field Counts

ROI forms are compact documents. Fully 52% are a single page, and another 39% are two pages. The median is one page; the mean is 1.7. Only a handful exceed three pages, and the outliers — El Rio Health at 16 pages, People's Health Centers at 10 — are not actually ROI forms at all but compliance booklets or Notices of Privacy Practices misidentified as request mechanisms.

Field counts range from 7 to 103, with a median of 20 and a mean of 25.5. The interquartile range is 15–25 fields, representing a standard one-page authorization with patient demographics, record-type checkboxes, recipient fields, and a signature block. At the high end, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital leads with 103 fillable fields across two pages, followed by Texas Oncology (95 fields), A.O. Fox Hospital (83 fields), and Northwestern Memorial Hospital (79 fields). These high-field-count forms are uniformly fillable interactive PDFs from major teaching hospitals or large systems — organizations where someone made a deliberate investment in digital form infrastructure.

## Digital-First vs. Scanned Paper

Approximately 95% of forms are digitally authored rather than scanned from paper. True image-only scans — photocopied paper forms saved as PDFs with no text layer — are relatively rare at roughly 7–13% of organizations, depending on how marginal cases are counted. This suggests the era of the flatbed-scanned authorization form is waning, though notable holdouts persist. Troy Regional Medical Center's form, a decade-old grayscale JPEG scan served over unencrypted HTTP, represents the absolute nadir: zero fillable fields, zero searchable text, completely inaccessible to screen readers, on a defunct legacy website.

But "digitally authored" must not be conflated with "digitally usable." The 133 organizations that produce clean digital PDFs without adding interactive fields represent a massive missed opportunity. Adding fillable form fields to an existing Word or InDesign document is a low-effort, high-impact improvement that most of these organizations could accomplish in an afternoon.

## Instructions, Plain Language, and Multilingual Support

**Instructions** accompany only 82 forms (43%). Teaching hospitals lead at 73%; critical access hospitals provide instructions only 14% of the time. When present, quality ranges from Blessing Hospital's page-by-page completion guidelines to perfunctory inline text. Critically, many forms lack even basic submission instructions — no fax number, no mailing address, no email. A patient who downloads and completes Troy Regional Medical Center's form, GI Alliance's form, or Alabama Medical Group's form has no way to know where to send it.

**Plain language** appears in 91 forms (48%). The slight majority relies on legalistic or clinical jargon, with dense authorization clauses, nested parentheticals, and sentences exceeding 100 words. Physician practices score highest on plain language (65%), while community hospitals score lowest (35%).

**Multilingual support** is available from 63 organizations (33%). Spanish is universal among these — all 63 include it. Beyond Spanish, the offerings are scattered: Haitian Creole (3 organizations, concentrated in South Florida), Portuguese (2), Chinese (2, including NewYork-Presbyterian), Somali (2, in Minnesota), and Hmong (1 — Prevea Health in Wisconsin, reflecting its local community). FQHCs lead at 48% multilingual, consistent with their mandate to serve diverse populations. Critical access hospitals trail at 10%.

The combination of all three quality markers — clear layout, plain language, and instructions — is present in only 48 forms (25%). Three-quarters of ROI forms fail at least one of these basic document design criteria.

## Layout and Visual Design

Clear layout is the strongest dimension: 165 of 190 forms (87%) are rated as having logical organization, section headers, and adequate spacing. Most follow a recognizable template: patient demographics at top, record-type checkboxes in the middle, recipient/delivery fields next, and a signature block at the bottom. This near-universal structural competence suggests that the basic organizational template for an authorization form is well established across the industry, even when other quality dimensions lag.

## The Best-Crafted Documents

**Flowers Hospital** (Dothan, Alabama) earned the study's only A grade (4.65/5). Its single-page form packs 66 fillable fields into a layout created in Adobe InDesign, offers five delivery methods including password-protected removable media, provides a professionally translated Spanish version with identical structure and field count, includes clear instructions, and is paired with a Swellbox online portal as an alternative pathway. It demonstrates that excellent document craftsmanship is achievable even for a mid-size community hospital.

**Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin** maintains one of the rare purpose-built patient self-access forms — separate from its third-party authorization — with question-based section headers ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?") and 49 fillable fields on a single page.

**NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital** represents the technical ceiling: 103 fillable fields across two pages, available in three languages (English, Spanish, Chinese), with a companion FAQ and Verisma portal. The sheer density of interactive elements makes this the most technically capable paper form in the study.

**Cherokee Health Systems** earns recognition for its bilingual color-coded instructional companion guides — separate annotated documents that walk patients through each form section in plain language, available in both English and Spanish.

## The Worst-Crafted Documents

**Troy Regional Medical Center** (Troy, Alabama) represents the floor: a decade-old image-only scan on a defunct legacy website, served over unencrypted HTTP, with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, a mandatory liability waiver, and a witness requirement. A patient attempting to use this form faces near-total failure.

**Neshoba General Hospital** and **Aaron E. Henry Community Health Center** (both F grades at 1.20/5) publish no ROI form at all — no form, no instructions, no digital pathway. Ironically, Neshoba demonstrates the technical capability to produce fillable PDFs; its employer authorization form has 54 interactive fields. The organization simply never applied that capability to patient records access.

**El Rio Health** publishes a 16-page HIPAA compliance booklet that describes the right to access records without providing any mechanism to exercise it. **La Clínica de La Raza** requires patients to compose a letter and mail it to a P.O. Box — no form exists in any format.

The gap between the best and worst is not a spectrum; it is a chasm. The top performers offer fully fillable, multilingual, digitally submittable forms with dedicated patient-access pathways. The bottom performers offer nothing — or worse, offer documents that actively mislead patients about what's required.

## Patterns by Organization Type

### System affiliation is the strongest predictor

Major health system affiliates produce fillable forms at 43%, more than double the rate of independent facilities (19%) or regional systems (14%). System-affiliated organizations also score higher overall (mean 3.57 vs. 3.10 for independents). The mechanism is clear: large systems invest in standardized, professionally designed form templates that cascade to member facilities. HCA's corporate template gives Riverside Community Hospital a 52-field fillable bilingual form; Community Health Systems' HIM-1406 gives Merit Health Central a 66-field fillable form with Spanish parity. Independent hospitals must build their own, and most don't.

### Teaching hospitals lead; critical access hospitals trail

Teaching hospitals have the highest fillable-form rate (40%), the highest mean technical score (3.27), the highest rate of instructions (73%), and the highest average field count (33.7). Critical access hospitals sit at the opposite end: 10% fillable, lowest mean technical score (2.79), only 14% with instructions, and the fewest fields on average (20.8). FQHCs score low on technical dimensions (mean 2.68) but lead on multilingual support (48%), reflecting their distinct mission.

### Size doesn't guarantee quality — but it helps

The correlation between organizational resources and document quality is real but imperfect. Vanderbilt University Medical Center, a leading academic center, publishes a 2023-dated form that is an image-only scan with zero fillable fields. Duke University Hospital's primary form, by contrast, has 67 fillable fields and a companion instruction document. Both are major teaching hospitals; the difference is institutional commitment, not resources. In the other direction, Decatur County Hospital — a 25-bed government-owned critical access hospital in rural Iowa — produces a fillable PDF with 61 interactive fields, outperforming many institutions with ten times its budget.

## The Grade Distribution

| Grade | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| A     | 1     | 0.5%       |
| B     | 81    | 42.6%      |
| C     | 94    | 49.5%      |
| D     | 9     | 4.7%       |
| F     | 5     | 2.6%       |

The modal grade is C — functional but with significant gaps. Nearly half the sample earns a B, indicating adequate but improvable quality. The near-absence of A grades (1 of 190) confirms that truly excellent ROI form craftsmanship remains exceptional. The bottom 7% (D and F grades) represent forms that create genuine barriers to patient access.

## What Would It Take to Reach a Baseline Standard?

The data suggests a surprisingly achievable baseline. A "minimum viable ROI form" would require:

1. **Fillable fields.** The single highest-impact improvement. Most organizations already produce clean digital PDFs; adding interactive fields is a straightforward technical step. If every born-digital flat PDF in the study had its fields made fillable, the fillable rate would jump from 26% to over 80%.

2. **Submission instructions on the form itself.** A fax number, email address, or mailing address printed on every form. This costs nothing and eliminates the absurd situation where a patient completes a form and has no idea where to send it.

3. **A one-page instruction companion** explaining what the form is, who should use it, what to expect, and how long it takes. Cherokee Health Systems and Blessing Hospital demonstrate this is achievable at any organizational scale.

4. **Spanish translation** for organizations serving communities with significant Spanish-speaking populations. Flowers Hospital's approach — a professionally translated version with identical structure and field count — is the gold standard, but even a basic translation would serve 95% of non-English-speaking patients in most markets.

5. **Differentiation between patient self-access and third-party authorization.** The study reveals that most organizations funnel patients through generic authorization forms designed for attorneys and insurers, creating confusion and imposing irrelevant requirements. A dedicated patient access form — as Group Health Cooperative and a handful of others provide — correctly frames the interaction.

None of these improvements requires new technology, vendor contracts, or regulatory changes. They require attention — the institutional decision that the document a patient uses to exercise a fundamental right deserves the same design investment as the organization's marketing materials. The data makes clear that this decision is the exception, not the rule. The typical ROI form is not badly designed; it is simply undesigned — a compliance artifact that was never reimagined as a patient-facing tool.
