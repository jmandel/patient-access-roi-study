# Document Quality Deep Dive — Batch 3

## Sample

This batch covers 190 organizations with scored data (5 of 195 lacked synthesis). The sample spans all five facility types: community hospitals (80), teaching hospitals (30), critical access hospitals (29), physician practices (26), and FQHCs (25).

## Format and Fillability

Only **50 of 190 forms (26%)** offer interactive/fillable PDF fields. The remaining 140 (74%) are flat, print-and-fill PDFs despite most being digitally authored. Within the flat forms, **14 (7%)** are image-only scans — photocopied paper forms saved as PDFs with no text layer, no searchability, and no screen reader accessibility. Another 5 organizations published no usable ROI form at all (page count of zero), leaving patients with no online starting point.

Teaching hospitals lead in fillability at 40%, compared to just 10% for critical access hospitals. Community hospitals (29%), FQHCs (24%), and physician practices (23%) cluster in the low-to-mid twenties. When combining fillable fields with online submission availability, **45 organizations (24%)** qualify as truly digital-first — the form can be completed and submitted entirely on-screen.

## Page Counts and Field Counts

Forms are overwhelmingly compact: **98 orgs (52%) use a single page**, and 75 (39%) use two pages. Only 11 forms exceed two pages, with outliers including El Rio Health's 16-page compliance booklet (not actually an ROI form) and Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers' 10-page document. The median is 1 page; the mean is 1.7.

Field counts range from 0 to 103, with a median of 20 and mean of 25.5. Teaching hospitals average the highest field counts (33.7), reflecting more granular record-type selection options and detailed consent sections. Critical access hospitals average the fewest (20.8), consistent with simpler, shorter forms.

## Layout, Typography, and Visual Design

Clear layout is the strongest quality dimension: **165 of 190 forms (87%)** score positively, with teaching hospitals at 97% and physician practices at 92%. Most forms follow a recognizable template: patient demographics at top, record type checkboxes in the middle, recipient/delivery fields, and signature block at bottom. Typography is generally adequate — though scanned forms like Troy Regional Medical Center's 200 DPI grayscale JPEG introduce blur and small (~9pt) legal text that challenges readability.

## Instructions

Only **82 organizations (43%)** include instructions with their forms. Teaching hospitals are the clear leader at 73%, while critical access hospitals trail badly at just 14%. Many forms assume the patient already knows what to do — no explanation of the process, expected timelines, or where to submit the completed document. Troy Regional Medical Center's form, for instance, contains no submission address, fax number, or department name; a patient who completes it has nowhere to send it.

## Plain Language

**91 forms (48%)** use plain, accessible language. Physician practices score highest (65%) and community hospitals lowest (35%). Many forms default to dense legal/regulatory language oriented toward third-party release rather than patient self-access, with liability waivers, re-disclosure warnings, and HIPAA citations that are functionally irrelevant when a patient requests their own records.

## Multilingual Support

**63 organizations (33%)** offer forms in languages beyond English. Spanish is nearly universal among these (63 orgs), with occasional Haitian Creole (3), Portuguese (2), Chinese (2), and Somali (2). FQHCs lead at 48% multilingual, consistent with their mission to serve diverse populations. Critical access hospitals trail at 10%. Flowers Hospital (Dothan, AL) stands out for publishing a professionally translated Spanish form with identical structure and field count — not a machine-generated afterthought.

## Notable Examples

**Exceptional craftsmanship:** Flowers Hospital earned the batch's only A grade (4.7/5). Its single-page form packs 66 fillable fields, offers five delivery methods (including password-protected removable media), provides both English and Spanish versions, and is paired with a Swellbox online portal. Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (4.4/5) is one of the rare organizations that maintains a dedicated patient self-access form separate from its third-party authorization, with question-based headers ("What records do you want?") and 49 fillable fields.

**Poor craftsmanship:** Troy Regional Medical Center's form is an image-only scan from 2015 hosted on a defunct legacy website, served over unencrypted HTTP, with zero fillable fields and no submission instructions. Neshoba General Hospital publishes no ROI form at all — ironically, its employer authorization form demonstrates the hospital is technically capable of producing fillable PDFs. Aaron E. Henry CHC and Franklin Primary Health Center similarly offer no online records request pathway whatsoever.

## Summary

The typical ROI form in this batch is a 1–2 page, flat PDF with about 20 fields, no fillable interactivity, clear visual layout but no instructions, English-only, and designed for third-party release rather than patient self-access. The gap between best and worst is enormous: top performers offer fully fillable, multilingual, digitally submittable forms with dedicated patient access pathways, while bottom performers publish nothing at all or offer decade-old scanned images on abandoned websites.
