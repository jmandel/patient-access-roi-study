# Document Quality Deep Dive — Batch 2 (190 Organizations)

## Format and Fillability

Of 190 organizations with scored data, only **50 (26%)** offer forms with fillable/interactive PDF fields; the remaining **140 (74%)** provide flat, print-and-fill documents. Five organizations earned a top technical accessibility score of 5 — Flowers Hospital, AdventHealth Hendersonville, Labette Health, King's Daughters Medical Center (Brookhaven), and Gastro Florida — all offering fully digital submission workflows (fillable PDFs with electronic submission or online portals). At the other extreme, **8 organizations scored 1** (the lowest), including Neshoba General Hospital, Troy Regional Medical Center, and Aaron E. Henry CHC — several of which publish no usable ROI form at all.

Approximately **32 organizations (17%)** have forms identified as scanned paper images or photocopies, producing image-only PDFs without selectable text. These include major institutions like Duke University Hospital and Vanderbilt University Medical Center — demonstrating that scan-quality problems are not limited to small or under-resourced facilities. By contrast, roughly **82 organizations (43%)** have forms described as born-digital or digitally produced, with proper text layers and clean typographic design.

## Page Counts and Field Counts

The typical ROI form is compact: **98 forms (53%) are a single page**, 75 (41%) are two pages, and only 12 (6%) run three or more pages. The longest outliers are El Rio Health's 16-page HIPAA compliance booklet (not itself an ROI form), People's Health Centers at 10 pages, and Anaheim Global Medical Center at 9 pages. Lengthy documents tend to combine multiple consent forms, multilingual versions, or HIPAA notices into a single PDF.

Field counts range from **7 to 103**, with a median of **20 fields**. The most field-rich forms belong to major academic medical centers: NewYork-Presbyterian (103 fields across a 2-page fillable PDF), Texas Oncology (95), A.O. Fox Hospital (83), Northwestern Memorial (79), and Newton-Wellesley/Mass General (78 each). At the low end, 5 organizations have 10 or fewer fields, typically simple name-date-signature forms that collect minimal information.

## Layout, Typography, and Visual Design

Most forms (**165 of 190, 87%**) were rated as having a clear layout, suggesting that basic organizational structure — section headers, logical field ordering, adequate spacing — is the norm rather than the exception. However, only **91 (48%)** use plain language throughout; the remainder lean on dense legalese, particularly in authorization and signature sections. Teaching hospitals average the highest content design scores (3.83/5), while FQHCs score lowest (3.08/5).

## Instructions and Guidance

Instructions accompany only **82 forms (43%)**. When present, they vary from embedded one-liners ("circle one") to separate FAQ documents. NewYork-Presbyterian stands out with a dedicated patient-facing FAQ covering record types, timelines, and MyChart alternatives. Most forms, however, expect patients to navigate fields without guidance — particularly problematic for complex forms with sensitive-information opt-ins or multiple delivery method choices.

## Multilingual Support

**63 organizations (33%)** provide multilingual forms. Spanish is overwhelmingly dominant (63 orgs), with rare appearances of Haitian Creole (3 — Broward Health, Good Samaritan Medical Center, Memorial Healthcare System), Somali (2 — Prevea Health, Olmsted Medical Center), Portuguese (2), Chinese (2 — NewYork-Presbyterian, La Clínica de La Raza), and Hmong (1 — Prevea Health). Broward Health and Prevea Health lead with four languages each. Flowers Hospital's Spanish form is a notable exemplar: a complete professional translation with identical structure and field count, linked co-equally alongside the English version — not a machine-generated afterthought.

## Notable Examples

**Best craftsmanship:** Flowers Hospital (Dothan, AL) — a single-page fillable PDF with 66 interactive fields created in Adobe InDesign, offering five delivery methods including password-protected removable media. Available in professionally translated English and Spanish. It is the only organization in this batch to earn an overall "A" grade.

**Worst craftsmanship:** Neshoba General Hospital (Philadelphia, MS) — no ROI form exists online despite the hospital demonstrating the technical capability to produce fillable PDFs for other purposes (an employer authorization form with 54 fields). El Rio Health (Tucson, AZ) publishes only a 16-page compliance booklet that describes the right to access records but provides no mechanism to exercise it.

**Most technically ambitious:** NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — 103 fillable fields across 2 pages, available in three languages, with a companion FAQ and Verisma online portal. The sheer density of interactive elements makes this the most technically capable paper form in the batch.

## Overall Picture

The "typical" ROI form in this batch is a **one-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF with about 20 fields, in English only, without instructions** — essentially a print-and-handwrite document. The overall grade distribution is telling: 1 A, 81 B's, 94 C's, 9 D's, and 5 F's. The median is firmly at C, reflecting forms that are functional but unambitious. The gap between the best (digitally designed, fillable, multilingual, patient-centered) and the worst (missing, scanned, or entirely inaccessible) is enormous — and does not neatly track organizational size or resources.
