# Batch 14: Document Quality Analysis

## Batch Composition

This batch spans 8 organizations across facility types (2 teaching hospitals, 1 community hospital, 2 critical access hospitals, 3 physician practices), ownership models (5 nonprofit, 3 for-profit), and 7 states (NY, WA, MA, FL, GA, TX, VT, NJ). Grades range from C (2.6) to B (4.0).

## Fillability and Interactivity

**Fillable/interactive PDFs: 2 of 8 (25%).** Only UW Medical Center (61 fields) and Advocare (41 fields) provide interactive PDF forms with fillable fields. The remaining 6 organizations publish flat, print-and-fill PDFs with zero fillable fields — despite all being digitally authored documents, not scans. This is a striking pattern: organizations are creating PDFs digitally but deliberately (or negligently) omitting interactive form fields, forcing a download → print → handwrite → scan/fax workflow.

**Image-only scans: 1 partial.** Southwell/Tift Regional's form-2 is an image-only scan produced on a Canon copier in July 2025 — a regression from their earlier digital-native form-1. No other organization in the batch uses image-only scans as their primary form.

**Digital-first vs. scanned: 7 of 8 digital-first.** All primary forms except Southwell's form-2 were born-digital with text layers and embedded fonts. However, "digital-first" here means only that the PDF was created digitally — not that the workflow is digital, since most still require printing and handwriting.

## Page Counts and Field Counts

| Org | Pages | Est. Fields | Fillable |
|-----|-------|-------------|----------|
| UW Medical Center | 3 | 61 | Yes |
| Advocare | 2 | 41 | Yes |
| Valley Medical Group | 1 | 22 | No |
| Copley Hospital | 1 | 18 | No |
| UF Health Shands | 1 | 18 | No |
| Southwell/Tift Regional | 2 | 18 | No |
| Cuba Memorial Hospital | 2 | 15 | No |
| US Dermatology Partners | 1 | 15 | No |

Page counts range from **1 to 3 pages**, with single-page forms being most common (4 of 8). Field counts range from **15 to 61**, with a median of 18. The two fillable forms (UW Medical Center and Advocare) are also the most field-rich, suggesting that organizations investing in interactivity also tend to create more comprehensive forms.

## Layout, Typography, and Visual Design

Layouts are generally functional. Seven of 8 forms received a "clear layout" rating. Most follow a top-to-bottom sectional flow: patient demographics → record types → recipient → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. UW Medical Center's numbered Items #1–7 structure and Copley Hospital's compact single-page design stand out positively.

Typography is adequate but unremarkable across the batch. No forms employ distinctive branding or visual hierarchy that would make them feel patient-friendly. The most common design flaw is wasted space: Southwell's form-1 devotes its entire second page to two short paragraphs and signature lines, and Cuba Memorial's 2-page forms could likely be consolidated.

Notable defects include a duplicated heading in Advocare's form ("Select from thethe following..."), a persistent "IDS" instead of "AIDS" typo in US Dermatology Partners' form since 2017, and a "but in do" instead of "but if I do" error in Cuba Memorial's forms since 2017. These uncorrected errors suggest templates that are rarely if ever reviewed.

## Instructions

**Forms with instructions: 3 of 8 (38%).** UW Medical Center includes a full page of item-by-item completion instructions — an unusual and genuinely helpful feature. Advocare's form-2 includes a Reference Guide explaining sensitive information categories with New Jersey law citations. UF Health Shands' instructions are minimal but present. The remaining 5 forms provide no guidance on how to complete them.

More critically, **3 of 8 forms lack submission instructions entirely** — US Dermatology Partners, Valley Medical Group, and Cuba Memorial Hospital provide no address, fax number, or email for returning completed forms. A patient who downloads and completes these forms would have no idea where to send them.

## Multilingual Support

**Multilingual forms: 2 of 8 (25%).** Valley Medical Group offers a Spanish translation through its MediCopy vendor, and Advocare provides a professionally translated Spanish-language fillable PDF linked alongside the English version. Notably, Advocare's Spanish form lacks the email delivery option present in the English version — a functional parity gap. The remaining 6 organizations are English-only.

## Notable Examples

**Best craftsmanship — UW Medical Center (Grade B, 4.0):** The standout document in this batch. A 3-page fillable PDF with 61 interactive fields, dedicated instruction page, 5 delivery format options (CD/DVD, Paper, MyChart, USB, Email), 3 submission channels with complete contact information, and a prominent MyChart fast-track callout for immediate record downloads. This is what a well-crafted ROI form looks like.

**Worst craftsmanship — Cuba Memorial Hospital (Grade C, 2.6):** The hospital publishes no form of its own. Patients must navigate to an affiliated organization's website, find forms branded for a different hospital, complete them by hand (no fillable fields), and somehow determine where to submit them (no submission instructions). A 2017 typo persists uncorrected across both available forms. For a rural critical access hospital whose patients may be 30+ miles from the nearest affiliated facility, this represents a genuine access barrier.

**Regression example — Southwell/Tift Regional:** Form-2 is a 2025-era image-only scan uploaded to replace a digitally authored form — the only case in the batch where document quality has demonstrably worsened over time.

## Patterns

The two fillable forms both come from larger organizations (UW Medicine system, Advocare multi-practice group), while all five single-practice or small-hospital forms are flat PDFs. The critical access hospitals (Cuba Memorial, Copley) both lack fillable fields and instructions, consistent with resource constraints at small rural facilities. However, form quality does not map cleanly to organizational size — UF Health Shands (1,030 beds, major teaching hospital) also publishes a non-fillable form with no interactive fields, suggesting that even well-resourced institutions may neglect document accessibility.
