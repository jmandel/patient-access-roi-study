# Document Quality Analysis — Batch 22

## Format Breakdown: Fillable vs. Flat vs. Scan

Of 12 organizations analyzed, the overwhelming finding is that **non-fillable, flat PDFs dominate**. Only **1 of 12** orgs (UCSF Medical Center) offers a fillable/interactive PDF with functional form fields (39 fields, with an explicit "Made accessible" remediation note). The remaining 11 produce digitally authored but completely static PDFs — every checkbox is a printed glyph, every blank an underscore line, requiring patients to print, handwrite, and physically submit.

One org stands out negatively on the format spectrum: **Nevada Health Centers** created its forms in Adobe Illustrator with no extractable text layer, making them effectively image-only documents despite being digitally designed — inaccessible to screen readers, unsearchable, and un-fillable. **Lincoln Hospital** (Davenport, WA) presents a split case: its hospital form has a proper text layer while its clinics form is a scanned paper image with zero extractable text — two documents from the same facility at opposite ends of the accessibility spectrum.

**Tally**: Fillable interactive: 1 | Flat digital-origin: 9 | Image-only/no text layer: 2

## Page Counts and Field Counts

Page counts are compact, ranging from **1 to 3 pages** with a median of 2. Four single-page forms (Aurora Medical Center–Grafton, Nevada Health Centers, University of Iowa, Alabama Medical Group) pack everything onto one sheet. Michigan Medicine is the longest at 3 pages, using the extra space for a detailed fee schedule table.

Estimated field counts range from **12 to 39**. Aurora's dedicated patient access form is the leanest (12 fields), while UCSF's comprehensive authorization has the most (39). Most orgs cluster at 15–22 fields. The field count does not strongly correlate with page count — Nevada Health Centers fits 25 fields onto a single bilingual page, while Brattleboro Memorial Hospital spreads just 15 fields across two pages.

## Digital-First vs. Scanned

**10 of 12** forms are clearly digital-first — created in word processors or design tools with proper text layers. Only Lincoln Hospital's clinics form is a true scanned paper document. Nevada Health Centers occupies a paradoxical middle ground: digitally created in Illustrator but with no text layer, behaving like a scan. No org in this batch uses a photocopied or faxed-quality document as its primary form.

## Layout, Typography, and Visual Design

Layout quality is generally adequate. **11 of 12** orgs have clear, logically organized forms with recognizable section flow (patient ID → authorization details → record types → signature). **Brattleboro Memorial Hospital** is the exception, with densely packed fields, misaligned checkbox labels across columns, and inconsistent use of ALL CAPS instructions mixed with standard text.

Typography is functional but uninspired across the batch. Most forms use standard system fonts with underscored blanks. Staff-facing administrative fields intruding into patient-facing areas is a recurring problem — Hartford Hospital opens with "MR#, Date Completed, Pages Copied, Initials" fields that mean nothing to patients. UCSF's form stands out for deliberate typographic hierarchy and parenthetical examples for each record type.

## Instructions and Clarity

**7 of 12** orgs include some form of instructions. **Blessing Hospital** is the standout, devoting its entire page 2 to field-by-field completion guidelines with plain-language examples — a feature nearly unique in the study. Michigan Medicine's package-based record selection (pre-built bundles like "Key Clinical Documentation") effectively substitutes for instructions by simplifying the most confusing part of any ROI form. Aurora's patient access form opens with a patient portal callout before the first field — proactively directing patients to a faster digital channel.

**5 orgs** provide no instructions whatsoever. **Alabama Medical Group** is the worst case: no submission instructions, no mailing address, no fax number printed on the form. A patient who downloads the PDF has no way to know how to return it without calling the office.

## Multilingual Support

**4 of 12** orgs (33%) offer multilingual support, all in English/Spanish:
- **Blessing Hospital**: separate Spanish PDF linked alongside the English version
- **Aurora Medical Center–Grafton**: Spanish forms available on a well-organized records page
- **Nevada Health Centers**: bilingual EN/ES content on the same page (all three forms)
- **UCSF Medical Center**: dedicated Spanish translation with separate revision tracking

UCSF's Spanish version has notable quality gaps — three spelling errors ("fnalidad," "específca," "tratatmiento") and a missing radiology section present in the English version, illustrating the challenge of maintaining translation parity.

## Notable Examples

**Best craftsmanship**: UCSF Medical Center — the only fillable form in the batch, with deliberate accessibility remediation, Spanish translation, logical field flow, and parenthetical examples. A model for what a digitally competent ROI form looks like.

**Best innovation**: Aurora Medical Center–Grafton (Advocate Health system) — offers a dedicated patient access form separate from the third-party authorization, with a portal callout at the top and 22+ granular record-type checkboxes including imaging by modality.

**Most improved**: Blessing Hospital removed its witness signature requirement between the April 2023 and September 2025 revisions and added detailed completion guidelines — evidence of active form stewardship.

**Worst regression**: University of Iowa dropped from 50 fillable fields in its older form to zero in the current version, while paradoxically adding language claiming to support "electronic completion."

**Worst practice**: Alabama Medical Group collects Social Security Numbers on its ROI form — unnecessary and a significant identity theft risk.
