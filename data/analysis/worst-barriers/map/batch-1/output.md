# Worst Barriers to Patient Record Access — Batch 1

## 1. Troy Regional Medical Center (AL) — Effectively Unfindable Form on a Defunct Website

Troy Regional's ROI form exists only on a defunct legacy website (trmc.fasthealth.com) with no link from the current site, which itself returns 502 errors on its Patient Info page. The form is a decade-old image-only scan with zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, and a mandatory liability waiver bundled into the authorization. It also demands that "ALL fields MUST be completed or authorization is invalid" — exceeding HIPAA requirements. A witness signature is required. This is the worst overall experience in the batch (grade D, 1.75/5). A patient trying to request their records online would simply fail. This appears to be institutional neglect rather than a deliberate barrier, compounded by a website migration that abandoned the records process entirely.

## 2. JPS Health Network (TX) — Potentially Excessive Fees and Contradictory Capabilities

JPS charges $30 for the first 10 pages and a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery — amounts that likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based standard for patient access. The fee schedule makes no distinction between patient self-access and third-party requests. Meanwhile, the core ROI form is a seven-year-old image-only scan, even though JPS's 2025 HIE forms prove the organization can produce modern fillable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The refusal to accept electronic submission of the ROI form ("It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time") is a deliberate choice, not a capability limitation. This pattern suggests the records access process has been deprioritized while other digital initiatives advanced.

## 3. Cottage Hospital (NH) — Cloudflare-Blocked Website, No Submission Instructions

Cottage Hospital's website is protected by Cloudflare Turnstile, which blocked all automated access including Google's cache. Forms were recoverable only through the Wayback Machine. Neither form includes submission instructions — no address, fax, email, or department name. A witness signature line and confusing remuneration fields (relevant only to sale-of-PHI scenarios) add unnecessary friction. The better of the two forms is buried on page 2 of a 12-page new patient packet with an unintuitive filename. This combination of technical barriers and missing guidance means a patient would need to call the hospital just to learn basic process steps.

## 4. EyeSouth Partners (GA) — Fragmented, Affiliate-Dependent Access

EyeSouth Partners provides no patient-facing records request process at the parent organization level. Patients must identify the correct affiliate practice, find its website, and locate a generic authorization form — a multi-step treasure hunt. One affiliate's form (Georgia Retina) charges a flat $25 fee without distinguishing patient access, asks for a reason for release (not required by HIPAA), and hasn't been updated since 2016. The primary form has no expiration date. This fragmentation appears structural — a PE-backed practice rollup that consolidated billing but not patient services.

## 5. Saratoga Hospital / Albany Med (NY) — $0.75/Page Fee Without Access Distinction

Saratoga Hospital's system-wide form discloses a $0.75/page copying fee applied uniformly, without distinguishing patient access requests (which HIPAA limits to cost-based fees) from third-party release. For a typical hospital record of 50–100+ pages, this could mean $37–$75+ for records a patient has a legal right to receive at cost. The form also lacks any reference to HIPAA's Right of Access or patient rights. This appears to be a systemic pattern across the Albany Med Health System rather than an isolated oversight.

## 6. Colquitt Regional Medical Center (GA) — Image-Only Scan with No Submission Path

The sole ROI form is a scanned image with no text layer, no fillable fields, and complete inaccessibility to screen readers. More critically, the form contains no submission instructions whatsoever — no fax, no address, no email, no department name. A witness signature line may mislead patients into thinking a witness is mandatory. For a government-owned community hospital, the absence of any digital accessibility represents a significant gap for patients with disabilities.

## 7. Nemaha Valley Community Hospital (KS) — SSN Collection on a Decade-Old Scan

This small critical access hospital's form prominently requests a Social Security Number — unnecessary for records release and a significant identity theft risk on faxable documents. The form is over a decade old (January 2014), is an image-only scan with no fillable fields, and provides no submission instructions. The very low per-page fee ($0.03) is a bright spot, but the SSN collection and missing submission guidance are concerning patterns for rural facilities with limited IT resources.

## 8. UF Health Shands (FL) — $1.00/Page Fee Applied Uniformly

UF Health discloses a $1.00/page fee without distinguishing patient access from third-party release. For patient self-access requests, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts — a flat per-page rate of this magnitude likely exceeds that standard. Combined with zero fillable fields across all four form versions and no dedicated patient access pathway, this creates both financial and procedural barriers at a major academic medical center.

## Summary of Barrier Patterns

Across this batch of 50+ organizations, several barrier patterns recur:

- **Missing submission instructions** (Colquitt, Cottage Hospital, U.S. Dermatology Partners, Valley Medical Group, Rio Grande Hospital, and others): Forms tell patients what to fill out but not where to send them — a basic usability failure.
- **Image-only scans and non-fillable PDFs**: The majority of forms lack fillable fields, even when digitally authored. Organizations like JPS demonstrate this is a choice, not a limitation.
- **Undifferentiated fees**: Saratoga ($0.75/page), UF Health Shands ($1.00/page), JPS ($75 electronic), and EyeSouth ($25 flat) apply third-party fee schedules to patient access requests without acknowledging HIPAA's cost-based cap.
- **SSN collection**: Multiple organizations (Nemaha Valley, Fisher-Titus, Lane County, Rio Grande, Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford) request Social Security Numbers unnecessarily, creating identity theft risk.
- **Witness requirements**: Troy Regional, Bath Community, Lane County, Southwell, and Community Health Center of Central Missouri require or imply witness signatures — a barrier HIPAA does not mandate for patient access.
- **Website/form abandonment**: Troy Regional and Canton-Potsdam Hospital have forms available only on defunct legacy websites, reflecting organizational transitions that left patient access in a gap.

The strongest performers (Providence Sacred Heart, GHC-SCW, Aurora/Advocate Health) distinguish themselves by offering dedicated patient access forms separate from third-party authorization — a structural choice that the majority of organizations in this batch fail to make.
