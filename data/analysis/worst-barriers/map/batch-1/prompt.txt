You are analyzing ROI form retrieval results for a study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city). Use this to contextualize your findings by org type.

Your task: identify the most significant barriers patients would face when trying to
request their records from organizations in this batch. Look for:
- Difficulty finding the form
- Burdensome requirements imposed on patients
- Poor technical accessibility
- Anything that would frustrate or discourage a patient

Write your findings to "output.md". For each barrier:
- Name the organization and describe the problem
- Explain the impact on patients
- Note whether this seems like an oversight or a pattern

End with a brief summary of barrier patterns across this batch.
Keep to 500-1000 words.

# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Newton-Wellesley Hospital (NWH) is a community hospital in Newton, MA, part of the Mass General Brigham (MGB) health system (formerly Partners HealthCare). For medical records requests, NWH uses the system-wide MGB authorization form rather than a facility-specific document. Two forms were found: the current MGB-branded authorization (form-1, dated 06/2024) and a legacy Partners HealthCare version (form-2, dated 01/2006) that remains accessible at an orphaned URL on nwh.org but is no longer linked from current navigation.

## Access Pathway

NWH does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary (and only current) form is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" designed to serve all release scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, and other recipients. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as someone authorizing release to a third party, selecting "Personal" as the purpose and checking a box to have records mailed to their own address. While functional, this approach requires patients to identify which sections apply to them and which to skip, without explicit guidance distinguishing patient access rights from third-party authorization.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. It frames the interaction as an "authorization" rather than a right, which is technically appropriate for third-party releases but conceptually misaligned for patient self-access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The NWH website provides a clear navigable path (Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records), though this redirects to the MGB parent system's medical records page where the user must expand a "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" accordion to access the download. This extra indirection is minor. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1) is a high-quality digital artifact. It features **78 fillable/interactive form fields** — checkboxes, text inputs, and date fields are all functional for on-screen completion. The form is organized into five clearly lettered sections (A through E) with a logical flow: patient info → permission/purpose → record types → sensitive information → understanding/signature. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The header prominently displays submission instructions (mailing address and fax number), and the form offers four delivery methods for the records themselves: Patient Gateway (portal), Secure Email, Fax, and Paper Copy via Mail. The inclusion of electronic delivery options is a notable strength.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though Section D (sensitive information authorization) contains dense regulatory text, particularly the 42 CFR Part 2 disclosure. This is legally required but not reader-friendly.

**Multilingual support** is a bright spot: the MGB medical records page offers the form in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

## Barriers

**Notarization**: Not required. Only a patient signature is needed.

**Fees**: The form subtly differentiates — copying fees are asterisked only for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes, while "Personal" and "Medical Care" are not marked, implying no fees for patient access requests. However, this is implicit rather than explicitly stated.

**Date requirement**: Section C states patients "MUST specify dates" (capitalized emphasis) for each record type category. HIPAA does not require patients to specify date ranges, and this requirement could function as a barrier for patients seeking comprehensive access to their records.

**Outside records carve-out**: Records from outside providers held by MGB will not be released unless the patient specifically requests them under "Other" — placing a knowledge burden on patients who may not know what outside records exist in their file.

## Strengths

- 78 fillable form fields enabling genuine digital completion
- Four delivery methods including portal and secure email
- Trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Portuguese)
- Implicit fee exemption for patient access requests
- Clean, well-organized layout with clear section headers
- Easy findability via web search or website navigation

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway; generic third-party authorization form only
- "MUST specify dates" requirement potentially exceeds HIPAA requirements
- No explicit statement of patient Right of Access
- Outside records require special knowledge to request
- Submission limited to fax or mail (no online form submission)

## Overall Assessment

Newton-Wellesley Hospital, through its parent system MGB, provides a technically well-executed authorization form that is easy to find and genuinely usable digitally. The form's 78 fillable fields, multilingual availability, and multiple delivery options represent above-average document quality. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, funneling all requestors through a generic authorization form. The "MUST specify dates" requirement and lack of Right of Access framing are missed opportunities to center the patient experience. Overall, this is a competent but generic approach — the form works, but it wasn't designed with the patient requesting their own records as the primary audience.

# Valleywise Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valleywise Health Medical Center, a government-owned independent community hospital in Phoenix, AZ, provides a notably patient-centered approach to medical records access. The organization maintains two distinct PDF forms: a general third-party authorization (Form 43439) and a dedicated patient access request form (Form 45643). This two-form architecture is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement, clearly separating patient self-access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Valleywise Health is among the organizations that get this right. Form 45643 — "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — is explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It does not require the patient to name a third-party recipient, does not include a purpose/reason field, and does not carry an expiration clause — all appropriate design choices for a one-time patient access request. Meanwhile, Form 43439 handles third-party disclosures with the appropriate authorization infrastructure (recipient designation, purpose selection, expiration, revocation rights). The organizational intent to differentiate is clear and well-executed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` returned direct PDF URLs. The organization's patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` also links to the forms. Both PDFs were publicly accessible from a standard WordPress media directory with no bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication. The descriptive filenames (e.g., `Form-45643-Patient-Request-For-Access-To-Protected-Health-Information_ENG_SPA.pdf`) make it clear which form is which.

## Form Document Quality

Form 45643 is a 2-page bilingual PDF (English page 1, full Spanish translation page 2). The layout is clean with a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection → date range → delivery format → recipient information → processing details → signature. The form offers an impressively granular record type selection with 16+ specific categories (discharge summary, H&P, nursing notes, operative reports, pathology, radiology, etc.) plus an "All Records" option. Delivery options include MyChart patient portal, paper copy, CD, USB, email, and fax.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a digitally-authored document. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the form's clean layout would translate well to interactive PDF fields. Submission is available via fax (602-655-9017) and email (ROI@valleywisehealth.org), providing adequate electronic pathways, but the print-and-handwrite step creates friction in an otherwise well-designed process.

The language is plain and accessible throughout, with clear instructions ("Please check (✔) the appropriate box(es) (❑) and fill in the blank(s) as needed") and a patient-friendly tone ("We appreciate your patience while we process your request").

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization, witness, or in-person requirements exist. The form states a HIPAA-compliant 30-day response timeline with a possible 30-day extension. Fee disclosure is vague — "Valleywise Health may charge a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing a fee schedule, though the language about "actual cost of the portable media" aligns with HIPAA's cost-based limits.

Two concerns stand out. First, the form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient access requests and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed or emailed. Second, the Spanish translation references "documento 43780" instead of the correct Form 43439, potentially sending Spanish-speaking patients searching for a nonexistent form.

## Notable Strengths

The standout features are the **full bilingual (English/Spanish) form** — not a summary but a complete parallel translation, appropriate for Phoenix's demographics — the **dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release, and the **granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control over their request scope. The email encryption transparency, defaulting to encryption with an informed opt-out, is a thoughtful touch.

## Overall Assessment

Valleywise Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its medical records access process. The dedicated patient access form, bilingual design, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options reflect genuine attention to the patient experience. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a paper-first completion workflow despite otherwise modern design sensibilities. The SSN field and Spanish-version cross-reference error are notable but secondary concerns. This is a well-designed system with room for straightforward technical improvements.

# The Valley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

The Valley Hospital is a nonprofit, independent community hospital in Paramus, NJ, operating under the Valley Health System umbrella alongside Valley Medical Group (VMG) and Valley Home Care. Four PDF authorization forms were found — two VMG versions (July 2023 and May 2023), one older hospital-specific form hosted on MRO Corp's site (last revised 2011), and one Valley Home Care form (April 2023). Critically, the hospital's medical records page now directs patients to an online records request tool with identity verification via driver's license photo, rather than linking to any downloadable PDF forms.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is the **online records request tool** accessible from the medical records page at `valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`. This represents a meaningful shift toward patient-centered digital access — the identity verification via driver's license photo suggests a workflow specifically designed for the patient themselves, distinct from third-party release scenarios.

The PDF forms, by contrast, are all **generic HIPAA authorization forms** designed for release of information to any recipient. None is a dedicated patient access form. The most current form (form-1, VMG, July 2023) accommodates patient self-access through instructions that say "If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF'" — functional but clearly an afterthought within a third-party disclosure framework. The four forms create a confusing landscape: a patient of The Valley Hospital proper might not realize the VMG form is what they need for ambulatory records, while a separate home care form exists for Valley Home Care patients. No guidance on the website explains which form applies to which entity.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the online records request tool is straightforward — the medical records page sits at a logical URL in the patient resources section. Finding the PDF forms, however, requires search engine assistance. The medical records page no longer links to any downloadable PDFs. The forms remain hosted at their original URLs on valleyhealth.com (and on mrocorp.com for the older hospital form) but are effectively orphaned. A patient who specifically wants a PDF form would need to search externally — not an unreasonable ask, but not ideal either.

## Form Document Quality

The best PDF form (form-1, VMG July 2023) is a well-structured 2-page document with a clear Section A/Section B organization and a full second page of step-by-step instructions with practical examples. The instructions are genuinely helpful — explaining how to designate self-access, offering example expiration events, and warning about unencrypted email risks. However, **none of the four forms has any fillable/interactive PDF fields** (all have `fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being born-digital documents with clean text layers, they are designed purely for print-and-fill workflow. The form offers five delivery methods — fax, paper copy, CD, unencrypted email, and encrypted email — a strong set of options. The encrypted email option is a positive differentiator.

The language is mixed: the instructions page uses plain language, but the sensitive information consent section is dense. The form's handling of sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance use, reproductive health) includes important NJ-specific protections but is complex enough to confuse lay readers. Approximately 20–25 fields must be completed, which is reasonable for a records authorization.

## Barriers

**Misleading "entire record" checkbox**: Checking "Entire medical record" on form-1 will *exclude* Behavioral Health Specialist and Substance Use Specialist records unless those boxes are also separately checked. This is the most significant red flag — a patient checking "entire record" would reasonably expect completeness.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "there may be a fee" based on page count but discloses no amounts. The older hospital form (form-3) explicitly states a $1/page fee for personal use, which may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access. Fees are processed through MRO Disclosure Management Solutions, a third-party vendor.

**No form submission instructions**: Form-1 tells patients what to fill out but never specifies where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email for submission. Only the revocation address is provided.

**No notarization or witness required** on the primary form (form-1), though the older hospital form (form-3) includes a witness line.

## Bright Spots

- **Online portal transition**: The org has moved its primary pathway to a digital records request tool, significantly improving access over PDF-only workflows.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: Offering encrypted email alongside standard options demonstrates privacy awareness.
- **Comprehensive instructions**: The full-page plain-language instruction sheet with practical examples is among the better guidance we've seen.
- **Five delivery methods**: Fax, paper, CD, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients meaningful choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

The Valley Hospital earns a **B grade** primarily because of its transition to an online records request portal, which places it ahead of organizations still relying solely on paper forms. The PDF forms themselves are adequate but generic — they serve third-party release as the primary use case and accommodate patient self-access as a secondary scenario. The absence of fillable fields on all four PDFs is a missed opportunity for born-digital documents. The misleading "entire record" exclusion and fee ambiguity are notable compliance concerns, though neither rises to the level of an active barrier to access. The organization's investment in an online portal signals a patient-centered direction, even as its legacy PDF forms lag behind.

# UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, part of the UCHealth system in Aurora, Colorado, provides a solid pathway for patients requesting their own medical records. The organization's medical records page is well-organized, directly links to the current authorization form, and offers an online request portal (MRO Express) as an alternative. Four PDFs were downloaded during retrieval, but only two are genuinely relevant: the current system-wide authorization form (form-4) and an older 2017-era predecessor (form-1). A third form (form-2) is a legacy inter-facility transfer document, and the fourth (form-3) belongs to an entirely different organization — UC Health Cincinnati — retrieved due to domain confusion between uchealth.org (Colorado) and uchealth.com (Cincinnati).

## Access Pathway: Generic Form with Strong Patient Accommodation

UCHealth does not offer a dedicated patient-access-only form. The current form (form-4, document #HIM19000.1025, revised October 2025) is a generic "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it accommodates patient self-access unusually well. The form includes an explicit "If released to self, select method of release" section with four delivery options: email, My Health Connection (patient portal), mail, and PowerShare (for radiology images). The fee schedule is split clearly between patient access (free via portal, free paper up to 100 pages, first radiology disc free) and third-party recipients (retrieval fee plus per-page charges). This dual fee structure is a standout practice — few organizations make this distinction so transparently on the form itself.

The organization also offers MRO Express, an online request portal, as an alternative to the downloadable PDF. This portal provides a fully digital pathway, though our evaluation focused on the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. UCHealth's medical records page (`uchealth.org/access-my-health-connection/medical-records-uchealth/`) was reachable within 1–2 clicks from the main website and clearly presented the download link, online portal option, and location-specific contact information. The only complication was domain confusion: a web search returned a form from UC Health Cincinnati (uchealth.com), which could mislead patients searching generically for "UCHealth" forms. Two older forms (2017 and 2018 vintages) also remain publicly hosted at their original URLs with no indication they are superseded, creating a minor stale-link hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4) is a single-page, digitally generated PDF with a clean text layer — not a scan. Despite its digital-native construction, it has **zero fillable form fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. This is a notable gap: the older form-2 (a legacy inter-facility document) actually had 54 fillable fields, demonstrating that UCHealth has the technical capacity for interactive PDFs but did not apply it to the current form.

The layout is logical — flowing from facility selection through patient demographics, purpose, recipient, date range, record types, disclosures, fees, and signature — but extremely dense. Approximately 28 record-type checkboxes, a full fee schedule, six numbered disclosure statements, a reproductive healthcare warning, and a confidentiality notice are all compressed onto a single page. The form helpfully defines "Visit record" vs. "Visit summary" in parenthetical notes, aiding patient comprehension. Language across the disclosures is plain and accessible, covering right to revoke, voluntary nature, no conditioning on treatment, and re-disclosure risks. The form does not include submission instructions (no address, fax number, or email for where to send it), though this information is presumably on the medical records web page.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

UCHealth imposes no significant barriers: no notarization, no SSN request (a problem on the older form-2, now corrected), no mandatory in-person submission, and no conditioning of treatment on signing. The patient fee structure — free portal delivery and free paper up to 100 pages — is among the most generous observed. A notable bright spot is the reproductive healthcare warning (item 6), alerting patients that released reproductive health information could be used in litigation — a post-*Dobbs* addition reflecting emerging privacy concerns. Sensitive record categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, genetic, sickle cell, reproductive health) each require separate patient consent, providing granular control.

The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (requiring print-and-fill), the absence of submission instructions on the form itself, and the failure to state a processing time commitment (the older form-1 promised 10 business days). The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Overall Assessment

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital earns a solid **B** grade. The organization makes its form easy to find, provides an online portal alternative, clearly accommodates patient self-access with separate delivery options and fee structures, and maintains strong compliance posture. The main shortcomings are the non-fillable PDF format and the dense single-page design. With fillable fields and submission instructions added to the form, this would approach best-in-class.

# A.O. Fox Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

A.O. Fox Hospital is a community hospital in Oneonta, NY, part of the Bassett Healthcare Network. It does not maintain its own medical records request form; instead, patients are directed to a single, network-wide "Authorization for Medical Record Release" (form H-6653) shared across all five Bassett facilities. This is the sole form available and serves as the primary pathway for any patient — whether requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Access Pathway

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of medical record release, not a dedicated patient access request form. However, it does meaningfully accommodate patient self-access: Section 2 includes a "Self, address listed above" checkbox, Section 7 offers "Patient Request" as a purpose option, and Section 4 defaults to electronic delivery via the MyBassett Portal when no format is specified. These features ensure a patient can navigate the form for self-access without excessive confusion, but the form's framing as an "Authorization for Medical Record Release" — rooted in 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization concepts rather than § 164.524 Right of Access — means patients are signing an authorization they don't technically need, and must navigate sections (verbal communication authorization, expiration dates, redisclosure warnings) that are largely irrelevant to self-access.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the pathway level. There is no separate patient access form, no distinct web page for individual record requests, and no portal-based request wizard. The single PDF form serves all purposes.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**, though not via A.O. Fox Hospital directly. A search for Fox-specific forms returned nothing; searching for the parent system — Bassett Healthcare Network — immediately surfaced a direct PDF link on bassett.org. A patient who knows Fox is part of Bassett would locate this quickly. One who searches only for "A.O. Fox Hospital medical records" might need an extra step. No bot blocking, broken links, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-constructed, digital-first fillable PDF** — one of the strongest technical implementations in the study. Key characteristics:

- **Fillable fields**: 83 AcroForm interactive fields across just 2 pages, covering every checkbox, text input, and signature area. This is unusually thorough.
- **Layout**: 10 clearly numbered sections with bold headings provide logical flow and easy scanning.
- **Delivery options**: Seven methods offered (MyBassett Portal, USB, CD, Fax, US Mail, in-person pickup at two locations, Email with encrypted/unencrypted options). The portal-first default is a progressive design choice.
- **Record type selection**: 13 categories plus "Entire Medical Record" and an open-ended "Other" field, with date range controls.
- **Sensitive records**: An opt-out model (Section 6) lets patients exclude categories they don't want disclosed, rather than requiring explicit opt-in for each — a patient-protective default.

**Weaknesses** are minor but notable: two typos ("Frist" for "First", "DISCLOUSRE" for "DISCLOSURE"), internal Windows file paths exposed in the revision line (`d:\forms\hosp\.ofm`), and dense legalese in the rights section — particularly the HIV/AIDS redisclosure paragraph, which is a single four-line sentence. The form does not mention fees or response times.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. The form requires only a patient signature — no notarization, no witness, no in-person submission requirement. The no-conditioning statement is clearly articulated. The one-year date range default ("If left blank, information from the past (1) year will be provided") could inadvertently limit scope for patients seeking older records, but this is a scope default rather than a true barrier.

## Bright Spots

- **Portal-first default delivery** is rare and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **83 fillable fields** on a 2-page form represents exceptional digital-first design.
- **Seven delivery format options** including encrypted email with explicit risk acknowledgment.
- **Opt-out model for sensitive records** defaults toward completeness.
- **No-conditioning language** explicitly protects patient rights.

## Overall Assessment

A.O. Fox Hospital, through its parent Bassett Healthcare Network, provides a technically excellent form that is easy to find and free of major barriers. The form's primary limitation is structural: it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual right of access — through a generic authorization framework designed for third-party release. While the form accommodates patient self-access well, it does not center it. A dedicated patient access pathway or a clearly separated section for self-access requests would elevate this from a good form to an exemplary one. Grade: **B**.

# UW Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UW Medical Center, part of the UW Medicine system (University of Washington), provides a single ROI form for all of its facilities: "Patient Authorization to Disclose, Release, and/or Obtain Protected Health Information" (form U0626, version V.2512, last approved December 2025). This 3-page fillable PDF covers Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center (Montlake and Northwest campuses), UW Medicine Primary Care, and UW Physicians. No separate patient-access-specific form exists — this is a generic HIPAA authorization serving both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UW Medicine does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from third-party authorization. The single form handles all release scenarios — attorneys, providers, insurers, and patients alike. The "Purpose of Request" section includes a "Personal" checkbox, and the "Recipient of Records" field lists "Patient" as one example alongside "Insurance Company, Attorney, Physician." A patient can certainly use this form, but the framing treats self-access as one option among many rather than a first-class use case.

However, UW Medicine partially compensates with an outstanding **MyChart fast-track**: the form opens with a prominent callout — *"Recent medical records are available via MyChart for immediate download without filling out this form"* — and page 3 elaborates with instructions and a URL. The form also notes that an electronic request form is available within MyChart as an alternative. This effectively creates a two-tier system: MyChart for recent records (instant, self-service), and the paper authorization for everything else.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. Web searches for UW Medical Center ROI terms immediately surfaced it, and the UW Medicine website's Patient Forms page links directly to the canonical URL on the UW compliance site (`depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf`). One complication: the uwmedicine.org CDN blocks programmatic downloads (403 errors), but since the official patient forms page links to the compliance-hosted version, patients following the normal path encounter no issues. No browser fallback was needed for the working URL.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-designed interactive PDF with **61 fillable fields**, a full text layer, and 10 embedded fonts — clearly a digital-first document, not a scan. The layout follows a logical **numbered structure** (Items #1–7): patient information, purpose, facility selection, recipient, record types, format preferences, and expiration. This is easy to follow and a patient could complete it without assistance.

**Language** is mostly plain and accessible, though the patient rights section on page 2 includes a dense legal paragraph about conditioning treatment on authorization that would challenge many readers. Page 3 provides item-by-item **completion instructions** — an unusual and genuinely helpful addition that sets this form apart.

**Delivery format options** are exceptional: CD/DVD, Paper, MyChart, USB/Thumb Drive, and Email — five choices, more than nearly any other provider form. **Submission channels** are equally strong: postal mail, fax ((206) 744-9997), and email (uwmedroi@uw.edu), with separate contacts for billing records.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. There is **no notarization or witness requirement**, no in-person submission mandate, and no fee disclosure on the form (neither a stated fee nor a stated exemption). The 3-year default authorization expiration is generous. Revocation requires a written request to the Compliance Office — standard but could be more accessible.

One ambiguity: the form includes a blanket statement that the authorization "permits UW Medicine to release information related to sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, behavioral or mental health services, and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse," which could confuse patients about whether signing automatically releases all sensitive categories.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart fast-track** at the top of the form actively diverts patients to faster self-service
- **Five delivery formats** give patients genuine choice
- **Three submission channels** (mail, fax, email) with complete contact information
- **Instruction page** with item-by-item guidance and honest expectations about record completeness
- **Multi-facility coverage** via a single form with clear facility checkboxes
- **Sensitive information opt-in model** for specific unit records (sexual assault, mental health, living donor)

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access form — generic authorization serves all purposes
- No mention of HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or fee limits for patient access
- "PLACE PATIENT LABEL HERE" hospital artifact may confuse patients filling out at home
- Fillable field names are empty in metadata, potentially indicating accessibility deficiencies for screen readers

## Overall Assessment

UW Medical Center provides a **competent, well-designed generic authorization form** with strong digital capabilities and multiple submission options. The MyChart promotion is a standout patient-centering feature that partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway. The form's thorough instruction page, granular record selection, and five delivery formats demonstrate genuine care for usability. The main gap is structural: patients requesting their own records navigate the same form designed for attorneys and insurers, with no acknowledgment that their rights and fee protections differ. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and mostly patient-friendly, but not designed around patient self-access as a primary use case.

# Erlanger Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga, TN provides three distinct ROI-related documents: a general system-wide "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form-1), a behavioral health–specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" (form-3). The existence of form-3 — a purpose-built patient access request form — is the key differentiator for this organization and the focus of this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Erlanger is one of the organizations that clearly distinguishes between a patient exercising their right of access and a third-party release authorization. Form-3 is titled "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" and opens with the option to "give me a copy of my health information" — framing the interaction as a patient right rather than an authorization for disclosure. This is structurally separate from form-1, which serves as the general-purpose ROI authorization covering any release direction (to self, third party, insurer, attorney, etc.). The existence of this dedicated pathway shows deliberate organizational awareness that patient access and third-party release are different use cases with different legal frameworks.

However, the dedicated form originates from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital (EWCH) and it is unclear from the form itself whether it applies system-wide. The general ROI form (form-1) does include a "_________myself" option in the "Release Information To" field, providing an alternate pathway through the broader form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. All three were surfaced through a single web search, with no login walls, bot blocking, or broken links. The main erlanger.org site hosts a Medical Records page under patient tools. Form-3's URL is under a "murphy" path that may be associated with a specific facility building, making it less discoverable via direct site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the primary patient access form, is a single-page, digitally authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The layout is clean and logical, flowing from patient identification through facility selection, date range, record type checkboxes, format preference, delivery method, and signature. The language is notably plain and patient-friendly, using first-person phrasing: "I would like," "I want these parts of my record." The form provides granular record selection with 18 options across hospital and office/clinic categories, giving patients meaningful control over scope.

Form-1 (the general ROI) is also digitally authored with a text layer but no fillable fields (2 pages, 14+ record type options). Form-2 (behavioral health) is an image-only scan — inaccessible to screen readers and impossible to fill electronically.

## Submission Methods

Form-3 does not clearly state how to submit the completed form. An "EWCH Use Only" section with "ID Verified" checkboxes implies in-person submission may be expected. However, the broader Erlanger system accepts fax submissions — form-2's instruction page provides a fax number for the HIM department, and form-1 includes fax as a contact/delivery option. Mail is also available. No online portal or email submission option exists for the forms themselves, though secure email is offered as a records *delivery* method.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness requirements exist. The primary patient access form (form-3) is completely silent on fees — patients have no idea if they will be charged. Form-1 mentions "charges may apply" for CD and paper copies but does not specify amounts. Form-3 notes a 30-day turnaround, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Both form-1 and form-3 request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary when combined with name, DOB, and medical record number. Form-1 bundles sensitive-category consent (substance abuse, HIV, mental health) with no opt-out mechanism, which may raise 42 CFR Part 2 concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release — a meaningful structural choice
- **Plain-language, first-person framing** that is unusually patient-friendly
- **Granular record type selection** (18 options across hospital and clinic settings)
- **Secure email as a delivery option** for receiving records
- **Single-page simplicity** for the patient access form

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any form — all require print-and-handwrite workflow
- **No fee disclosure** on the patient access form
- **Unclear submission process** for form-3 (implies in-person with ID verification)
- **No patient rights statement** on the dedicated access form
- **Behavioral health form (form-2)** is an image-only scan with production errors (placeholder text left in)

## Overall Assessment

Erlanger demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form with plain language and granular record selection. The organizational awareness that patient access differs from third-party release is commendable. However, the complete absence of fillable fields, unclear submission instructions, and lack of fee transparency prevent the experience from being truly streamlined. The overall pathway earns a **B** — solid design intent held back by technical and process execution gaps.

# Yale New Haven Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH), a major teaching hospital in New Haven, CT, is part of the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS). For medical records requests, YNHH uses a system-wide fillable PDF form titled "Authorization for Access/Release of Information" (Form F4918Eng, dated 07/19). A second form exists for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, another YNHHS facility, but it is not the primary form for YNHH patients. The assessment below focuses on Form 1 as the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records from Yale New Haven Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient-Friendly Features

YNHH does not offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from its third-party release authorization. The single system-wide form serves both purposes. However, the form makes notable accommodations for patient self-access: the title includes the word "Access" (not just "Release"), "Personal use" is listed as the first purpose option, and the form supports bidirectional requests (both "RELEASE information TO" and "OBTAIN information FROM"). Despite these touches, the underlying structure is a generic HIPAA authorization. A patient requesting their own records must designate themselves as the "recipient" — an awkward fit that reveals the form's third-party-release DNA. The form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or frame the request as an exercise of the patient's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search immediately surfaced it on the YNHHS parent system website, which hosts a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page with direct PDF download links. No login, account creation, or bot-blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on ynhhs.org (parent system) rather than ynhh.org (hospital), which is logical but could cause mild confusion for patients starting at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

Form 1 is an impressive digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 97 interactive form fields — one of the highest counts in the study. Every data-entry point appears to have an interactive field, enabling patients to complete the form entirely on-screen before printing for signature. The two-page layout follows a logical flow: patient identity → purpose → recipient → delivery method → facility/visit selection → date range → record types → sensitive information exclusions → legal disclosures → submission instructions → signature. Sections are clearly delineated and the form is dense but functional.

The language is mostly clear in the data-entry sections but shifts to dense legal prose in the "I understand that" statements on page 2. The minor consent paragraph is particularly complex, with nested age thresholds under Connecticut state law. The sensitive information section uses an opt-out model (all sensitive records released unless the patient initials specific exclusions), which is patient-friendly in intent but uses double-negative framing that could confuse.

## Submission and Delivery

The form offers robust submission options: mail (PO Box 9565, New Haven), fax (203-688-4645), and three email addresses differentiated by entity (Hospital, NEMG, Yale Medicine). This flexibility is a genuine strength — patients can submit electronically without visiting the facility.

For delivery, five options are available: MyChart portal (requiring an active account), mail, fax, secure email, and pick-up. MyChart delivery is a standout feature that most ROI forms lack, offering an end-to-end electronic pathway for records receipt.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The authorization is valid for one year, and revocation rights are clearly explained. The voluntariness statement is explicit: treatment is not conditioned on signing.

The main compliance gap is ambiguous fee language. "Reasonable cost-based fees apply" appears next to radiology images, while "There may be a charge for copies in accordance with Connecticut law" appears in the legal section. Neither amount is disclosed, and the form does not clarify whether the HIPAA cost-based fee ceiling applies when a patient requests their own records. The turnaround commitment of 10 business days is explicit and well within HIPAA's 30-day limit.

## Notable Strengths

- **97 fillable fields** — exceptionally high digital-first form design
- **MyChart delivery** — electronic records receipt via patient portal
- **Multiple submission channels** — three email addresses, fax, and mail
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific categories plus complete record option
- **10-business-day turnaround commitment** with a customer service phone number

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as third-party requesters
- **Wet signature required** — breaks the digital workflow (fill → print → sign → scan → email)
- **Fee language is ambiguous** — does not distinguish patient-access fees from third-party fees
- **Form last updated July 2019** — nearly seven years old, may not reflect current policies
- **No multilingual versions found**

## Overall Assessment

Yale New Haven Hospital provides a competent, digitally mature records request experience that falls short of true patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF, multiple submission/delivery options, and MyChart integration demonstrate genuine investment in accessibility. However, the organization has not taken the step of creating a distinct patient access pathway — patients must navigate a dual-purpose authorization form designed primarily for third-party release. The result is a solid B-level experience: functional and mostly friction-free, but not designed around the patient's perspective.

# Vanderbilt University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Vanderbilt Health offers patients multiple pathways to request their medical records. The official medical records page at vanderbilthealth.com lists both downloadable PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish) and three online portals: a **Swellbox patient request portal**, a Swellbox provider request portal, and a ChartSwap third-party request portal. The separation of these portals by requester type — patient, provider, and third party — is a meaningful structural differentiator that many organizations lack.

Five PDF documents were discovered across Vanderbilt web properties. The current official English form is **form-4.pdf** (VMR 3017, dated 10/2023), a 2-page authorization linked from the main medical records page. Form-5 is its Spanish translation. Forms 1 and 2 are older versions (2022 and 2017 respectively) still publicly hosted on VUMC subdomains with no deprecation notice. Form-3 is an incoming-records form (release TO Vanderbilt) irrelevant to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Vanderbilt partially differentiates individual access from third-party release. At the portal level, the separation is clear: patients, providers, and third parties each have distinct Swellbox/ChartSwap entry points. However, at the PDF form level, Vanderbilt uses a single generic "Authorization for the Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — a HIPAA § 164.508 authorization form doing double duty for patient access requests that should technically fall under § 164.524 Right of Access. The form does correctly scope the purpose question in Section 8, noting it is only required "if not for your personal use," which recognizes patient self-access as the default. But the overall framing ("I hereby give Vanderbilt Health permission to disclose my individually identifiable protected health information") miscasts a patient right as a permission grant.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. The official vanderbilthealth.com medical records page clearly links both the English and Spanish PDFs under "Request Records by Authorization Form," and all downloads succeeded without bot blocking or login walls. The primary findability concern is that **outdated versions persist** on VUMC subdomains (student health, information privacy & security) — a patient searching Google could land on the 2017 or 2022 version, which has different fee structures, fewer facilities, and old branding, with no indication it's superseded.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4 is compact and well-organized, condensed from the older 4-page format to 2 pages with 10 numbered sections and clear bold headers. However, it is fundamentally an **image-only scan** — zero fillable fields, only 61 characters of extractable text, and no screen-reader accessibility. A patient must print it, complete it by hand, and submit via mail or fax. The electronic delivery option described in Section 4 (PDF through a request portal, directions sent to email) is a genuine patient-friendly feature. The fee schedule, while complex (6 scenarios), is transparently disclosed with all fees capped at $50 and a $6.50 flat rate for fully electronic delivery.

The form requests Last 4 SSN, which is more personal information than necessary. Section 9's acknowledgment section packs 11 bullet points of legal text in small font. The sensitive-information handling (Section 6) defaults to including psychiatric, substance use, and HIV information with an opt-out checkbox — permissible but puts the burden on the patient.

## Barriers and Strengths

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization or witness is required. Submission is possible via fax (adequate electronic pathway) and mail, plus the Swellbox portal provides a fully digital alternative. The 30-day response timeline is stated explicitly, and the form commits to no treatment conditioning. Fees are disclosed upfront and capped.

**Notable strengths** include: the Spanish-language version linked alongside the English form; the differentiated Swellbox patient portal as a digital alternative; the transparent and capped fee schedule; the correctly scoped purpose question; and the inclusion of an electronic delivery option via a request portal. The QR code on the form header may provide an additional pathway, though its destination isn't determinable from the PDF.

**Red flags** are the dual-purpose authorization framing, the persistence of outdated forms on subdomains, and the image-only scan format — surprising for a 2023 form from a major academic medical center that fails basic WCAG/Section 508 accessibility standards.

## Overall Assessment

Vanderbilt Health provides a **competent but imperfect** patient records request experience. The organization earns credit for offering differentiated digital pathways (Swellbox patient portal), a Spanish translation, transparent fees, and a well-organized 2-page form. It falls short on digital-first form design (image-only scan, no fillable fields) and conflates patient access rights with third-party authorization. The availability of the Swellbox portal as an alternative substantially mitigates the PDF's technical limitations, making this an organization that serves digitally-savvy patients reasonably well while leaving paper-dependent patients with an unnecessarily cumbersome experience.

# Rhode Island Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rhode Island Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Providence, RI, is part of the Brown University Health system (formerly Lifespan). Two PDF forms were retrieved: a system-wide "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" form (form-1, updated October 2024) and a department-specific imaging-records release form (form-2, Lifespan Medical Imaging, revised February 2023). Form-1 is the primary form relevant to a patient requesting their own records from Rhode Island Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Rhode Island Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both retrieved forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. The primary form (form-1) frames the workflow around disclosing records *to* a named recipient ("To release to:"), which is the structure of a third-party authorization — not a patient self-access request. While the form does include "Patient Request" as a purpose checkbox (Section 4), a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in their own name as both the patient and the recipient. There is no separate form, section, or process that recognizes individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 as distinct from authorized disclosure to third parties.

The hospital does maintain a dedicated medical records request webpage at `brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records` with contact information, which is a helpful navigation aid. However, this page directs patients to the same generic authorization form rather than offering a simplified patient-access workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the primary form, and a site-specific search confirmed the URL and identified the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or other access barriers were encountered. The PDF was directly downloadable from a public URL. This is a strong point — many organizations make form discovery far more difficult.

## Form Document Quality

**Fillability**: The primary form is a born-digital PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being a recently updated document (October 2024), patients must print it and complete all fields by hand. This is a missed opportunity given the form's digital origin — adding interactive fields would be trivial.

**Layout and organization**: Form-1 uses a logical 11-section numbered structure covering facility selection, recipient, dates, purpose, format, record types, exclusions, and legal terms — all compressed onto a single page. The structure is clear, but the density is high, with legal boilerplate competing for space with patient-facing fields.

**Language**: The legal sections (8–11) use standard but dense regulatory language. No plain-language summary, explanatory guidance, or patient-friendly instructions are provided. A patient without familiarity with HIPAA authorization forms would likely find the legal sections intimidating.

**Record format options**: Limited to "paper" or "CD disc" — no electronic delivery option (email, portal, secure link) is offered. This is notable for a 2024 form, especially given HIPAA's requirement to provide records in the electronic format requested if readily producible.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Broad liability waiver**: Section 9 requires patients to "release Brown University Health, its employees and my physicians from all liability arising from this disclosure of my health information." Bundling a blanket liability release into a records authorization is aggressive and may discourage patients from exercising their access rights.
- **Vague fee language**: The form notes "There may be a fee associated with this request" without specifying amounts, providing a fee schedule, or distinguishing between patient-access fees (HIPAA-capped) and third-party release fees.
- **No electronic delivery**: Offering only paper and CD in 2024 creates a barrier for patients seeking digital access.
- **Out-of-state contact numbers**: Status inquiry numbers route to Massachusetts and California area codes, suggesting outsourced ROI processing — potentially confusing for Providence-based patients.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record-type selection**: ~10 specific record categories plus a behavioral health subsection, with a helpful "Abstract" definition footnote, give patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.
- **Sensitive information protections**: Five categories of sensitive information (sexual abuse, mental health, STIs, substance use, HIV) can be excluded, respecting both 42 CFR Part 2 and Rhode Island state law.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: A single form covers all Brown University Health facilities with clear checkboxes, avoiding the need to locate separate forms.
- **Easy findability**: Forms are prominently available online with no access barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Rhode Island Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and logically organized, but it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual access rights — through a generic third-party authorization workflow. The absence of fillable fields, electronic delivery options, and a patient-access-specific pathway places it squarely in the middle of the pack. The embedded liability waiver and vague fee language are concerning, though the granular record-type options and sensitive-information protections are commendable. A patient can successfully request records, but the process was clearly designed for institutional disclosure workflows rather than patient self-service.

# University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two versions of the same form were found: **Form 1989 ("ADMIN – Consent to Release of Information and Right of Access Request")**. Form-1 is the current official version (revised May 2024), hosted on the university's healthcare domain. Form-2 is an older revision (August 2021) hosted on a third-party CDN, pre-populated for a driving rehabilitation service ("Safer Driver Solutions"). Form-1 is the canonical, patient-facing document; form-2 is irrelevant for direct patient self-access and is included only for completeness.

The organization directs patients to a clear medical records request page at `uihc.org/medical-records-request`, which links to the PDF form and provides submission instructions. Submission options include email (`him-consentform@uiowa.edu`), fax (two numbers), and physical mail — a notably flexible set of channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form title explicitly names both functions: "Consent to Release of Information **AND** Right of Access Request." This dual-purpose naming is unusual and shows awareness that patients may exercise their HIPAA right of access. However, the form body does not differentiate the two use cases. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no separate workflow, and — critically — no "send records to myself" shortcut. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Send UI Health Care information to" field, effectively treating themselves as a third party. Ironically, the older form-2 included a "Myself at the address above unless noted below" option, which the current revision dropped.

The organization does not distinguish between individual access requests (governed by HIPAA § 164.524) and third-party authorization (governed by § 164.508) in its process or documentation. This is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that acknowledges patient access in name only.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF link. The official medical records page provides clear context and instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, CAPTCHAs, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, natively digital PDF with a clean text layer (4,233 characters). Despite being digitally created, it has **zero fillable fields** — a significant regression from the older form-2, which had 50 fillable fields. Patients must print the form, complete it by hand, scan it, and then submit electronically (email or fax) or by mail. The form's consent language acknowledges electronic completion ("as valid as if you signed the consent in writing"), creating a paradox: the form claims to support electronic completion but provides no interactive fields to enable it.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient → format options → record types → date range → reason → consent → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Sections are spatially separated but lack labeled headers. The language is generally clear, though the consent block contains moderately dense legal prose. Record type options are comprehensive (16+ checkboxes), and the form thoughtfully includes legacy entity lines for patients who received care under prior organizational names (Corridor OB GYN, Mercy Clinics, Mercy Hospital).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states a 30-day response commitment, aligning with HIPAA requirements. The non-conditioning statement is present and properly worded. Fee disclosure is vague: "I understand there may be a charge for this information" — without distinguishing between patient access fees (limited under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. Revocation requires written notification to the Director of Health Information Management, a minor but unnecessary barrier.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Exceptional findability. Multiple electronic submission channels including email. Dual-purpose form title acknowledging right of access. Legacy entity lines accommodating merged organizations. Comprehensive record type selection. Five delivery format options including electronic media (CD, USB, email).

**Red flags**: The current official form regressed from 50 fillable fields to zero — a clear step backward in digital accessibility. The removal of the "Myself" recipient option from the current form makes patient self-access less intuitive than in the older version. Vague fee language fails to inform patients of their right to cost-based fees under HIPAA.

## Overall Assessment

University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics earns credit for excellent findability, multiple submission channels, and a form that at least names patient access in its title. However, the lack of fillable fields on the current form, the absence of a differentiated patient self-access pathway, and the regression from the more interactive older version weigh against it. The organization provides an adequate but not patient-centered experience — a patient can get their records, but must navigate a form designed primarily for third-party authorization using a print-and-fill workflow.

# Rio Grande Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rio Grande Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Del Norte, Colorado. It offers a single downloadable PDF ROI form — a generic "Authorization for Release of Information" — used across both the hospital and its affiliated clinic. Importantly, the organization also provides embedded HIPAA-compliant JotForms on both the hospital and clinic patient records pages, giving patients an online submission pathway alongside the traditional PDF.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one PDF form was retrieved: **form-1.pdf**, a one-page "Authorization for Release of Information" created in Microsoft Word 2013 and uploaded in December 2018. The same PDF is linked from both the hospital and clinic records pages. In addition, each page embeds a separate JotForm (hospital JotForm ID: 220685534838162; clinic JotForm ID: 220685679526166) for online submission, providing a digital-first alternative to the downloadable PDF. The "FOR OFFICE USE ONLY" section on the PDF also references fax and mail as delivery methods used by staff.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Rio Grande Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses classic third-party authorization framing — "I authorize ___ to disclose my individually identifiable health information" — requiring the patient to fill in both a "To" and "From" entity. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should list Rio Grande Hospital as the "From" and themselves as the "To," which is workable but unintuitive. The form does include a "Personal Use" purpose checkbox, which is the closest acknowledgment that patients may be requesting records for themselves. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524, and no mention of electronic health information export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Web searches quickly surfaced the hospital's patient records pages, and the PDF had a descriptive URL. The JotForms are prominently featured on the pages, while the downloadable PDF sits in the sidebar — meaning the online pathway is actually more visible than the print form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was required.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable document with zero interactive form fields. Despite being digitally created (not a scan), it uses underscored blank lines for handwriting — a print-era design. At one page, it is appropriately concise. The layout follows a logical sequence (patient identity → parties → record types → HIV authorization → purpose → legal terms → signature), but the opening authorization paragraph is a dense, multi-line sentence covering communicable diseases, mental illness, and redisclosure warnings all at once. Record type options are limited to four checkboxes (History/Physical, Lab Results, X-Ray Reports, Other Diagnostic Reports) with no option for "all records," discharge summaries, medications, or billing. The form opens with "THIS REQUEST MUST BE FILLED OUT COMPLETELY" in emphasized text — a stern tone that could discourage patients uncertain about fields like SSN.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flag is the **SSN collection** — the form requests Social Security Number as a standard identifier alongside name and DOB, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk. The form also provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or reference to the online JotForm. A patient who downloads and fills the PDF has no clear next step. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeframe is stated. The form does not require notarization or a witness.

## Notable Strengths

The standout bright spot is the **online JotForm submission option**. While not part of the PDF itself, the organization provides a fully digital pathway for records requests via embedded web forms on both hospital and clinic pages. This is a meaningful investment in patient accessibility. The form's **non-conditioning language** ("I understand that my health care and the payment of my health care will not be affected if I do not sign this form") is a positive HIPAA compliance element. The **single-page format** keeps things concise. The HIV/STD/AIDS opt-in/opt-out structure with patient initials properly addresses Colorado's heightened protections for sensitive health information.

## Overall Assessment

Rio Grande Hospital provides a functional but dated records request experience. The PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no patient-access differentiation, no fillable fields, an unnecessary SSN field, and no submission instructions. However, the organization partially compensates with its JotForm-based online submission pathway, which gives patients a digital-first alternative. The best available pathway for a patient is the online JotForm, though the PDF form — the only downloadable document — falls short of modern patient-centered design. For a small independent critical access hospital, the investment in online forms is commendable, but the underlying authorization framework remains oriented toward third-party release rather than individual access rights.

# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Anchorage, Alaska. Two documents were retrieved from its publicly accessible forms page: a primary ROI authorization form ("Advanced Authorization for Release of Information," Rev. 08/2025) and a standing PHI Disclosure Agreement (Rev. 8/4/23). Of these, form-1 is the relevant document for a patient requesting copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

ANHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary ROI form (form-1) is a dual-purpose generic HIPAA authorization covering both "obtain information from" an external source and "release information to" a third party. A patient wanting their own records must check "Release Information to" and fill in their own name and address as the recipient — functional, but not intuitive. The form's instructions frame it around sending records elsewhere, not around the patient's individual Right of Access. There is no separate, simplified pathway for patients who just want their own records.

That said, the form does include a notably strong patient-rights statement: it explicitly cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and tells patients they are "NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information." This is uncommon and commendable, partially compensating for the generic form structure.

The retrieval notes also mention a text-based ROI request option (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which could be a more accessible alternative channel, though its scope and workflow aren't detailed on the forms page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped search surfaced the ANHC forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms), which is well-organized with clear section headings including a "Request a Release of Information" section with direct PDF links. No bot blocking, captchas, or authentication barriers were encountered. The form was also available in Spanish, which is a notable accessibility feature for an FQHC. Difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally composed document — not a scan — with a clean text layer and reasonable file size (164 KB). However, despite being revised as recently as August 2025, it has **zero fillable PDF fields**. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and return it via fax or in person. This is a significant missed opportunity for a document that is clearly digitally designed.

The form collects approximately 15 fields: patient name, DOB, last four SSN digits, two phone numbers, full address, recipient information, record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization, date range, and signature. Requesting SSN digits is unnecessary for a records request and adds friction. The form fits everything on one page, which is efficient but dense. Layout is adequate with clear section divisions, though the volume of content compressed onto a single page limits whitespace.

Language is generally accessible. The introductory "PLEASE READ" paragraph is clear and plain-language. The legal disclosure section is denser but not impenetrable, covering authorization voluntariness, expiration, revocation rights, and redisclosure prohibitions. There is a typo ("heath care" instead of "health care") and a malformed HIPAA citation in the legal text.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Fees**: The form discloses that ANHC charges for copies, with an exception for facility-to-facility transfers. It does not clarify that patient self-access requests are subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee limits, which could discourage patients.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting the last four SSN digits is unnecessary and creates friction.
- **No notarization** required — positive.
- **Submission**: Fax (907-743-7255) is available as an electronic submission method. The form also lists the physical address. No email or portal submission option exists for the ROI form itself, though ANHC does use MyChart (referenced in form-2).
- **Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit HIPAA Right of Access citation** (45 CFR § 164.524) with clear patient-empowering language
- **Spanish-language version** of the ROI form available
- **Text-message alternative** for initiating ROI requests
- **Recently revised** (08/2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Adolescent privacy protections** on form-2 (MyChart proxy access controls for minors 12–17)

## Overall Assessment

ANHC presents a mixed picture. The forms are easy to find, the website is well-organized, and several bright spots — Spanish availability, text-message option, explicit HIPAA rights language — show genuine attention to patient access. However, the core pathway funnels patients through a generic third-party authorization form rather than offering a dedicated patient self-access route, the primary PDF has no fillable fields despite recent revision, and the fee language could discourage patients from exercising their rights. For an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations, the lack of a fillable digital form is a notable gap. The organization earns credit for accessibility features and rights transparency, but falls short on digital form quality and access pathway differentiation.

# Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph offers two versions of the same general-purpose ROI authorization form (Form #3014) linked from different pages of its website. Form-1 (dated 03/28/2019) is the current version, found on the Health Information Management page under "Authorizations and Forms." Form-2 (dated 11/24/2015) is an older version linked from the Privacy Policy > HIPAA Authorization Form page. Both are flat (non-fillable) PDFs. A third version in .docx format with entirely outdated "Heartland Health" branding was also discoverable via web search. The organization additionally uses Epic MyChart as a patient portal, though the ROI forms make no mention of it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mosaic Life Care does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both form versions are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request to Another Agency," framing the process as a release of records to a third party. A patient wanting their own records must fill in themselves as both the requesting party and the recipient. While "Personal" appears among 12 purpose options, there is no language, section, or streamlined flow that addresses HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) as a distinct use case. The form does not reference the Right of Access by name, does not explain associated timelines or fee limits, and does not mention the patient portal as an alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were relatively easy to find — 2–3 clicks from the homepage via the HIM page. Site-specific search also surfaced the relevant pages. The main complication is fragmentation: two versions of the same form (same form number) are published simultaneously on different pages with no indication of which supersedes the other. This creates a risk that patients encounter the outdated 2015 version, which still references the organization's former name ("Heartland Regional Medical Center") in its legal disclaimer.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) has a text layer and is not a scan, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore placeholders, requiring the patient to print and handwrite responses. The 2-page form follows a logical flow (demographics → source facility → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature) and uses a two-column layout that makes efficient use of space. The 13-category record type checklist with an "Other" option provides granular control over what is released. However, the language mixes plain and legal styles, with the deceased-patient section and legal disclaimers being notably dense. The form requires a purpose selection ("must select one"), which is not required under HIPAA for patient self-access requests.

## Barriers and Notable Issues

No notarization is required. Forms can be submitted via email (ROI@myMLC.com), fax, or mail — multiple electronic submission channels are available, and in-person delivery is not required. However, form-1 says nothing about fees, while the older form-2 vaguely mentions records "may be subject to copying fees" without specifying amounts or HIPAA fee limits. No response time commitment is stated. The mandatory purpose field is a potential compliance concern for patient self-access requests. An "Identification type / Verified by" line on the form could mislead patients into thinking in-person ID verification is required, though the form can be submitted remotely.

## Strengths

The standout bright spot is the 15-language assistance notice on page 2 of form-1, covering an unusually comprehensive set of languages including Pennsylvania Dutch and Trukese — reflecting attention to local community demographics. The granular record type selection and multiple submission channels (email, fax, mail) are also positive features.

## Overall Assessment

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph provides a reasonably findable but fundamentally paper-oriented ROI process that funnels all requesters — including patients seeking their own records — through a generic third-party release authorization. The form quality is adequate with logical organization and good scope controls, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and missing fee/timeline information limit patient-centeredness. The organization earns a **C grade**, reflecting an acceptable but unremarkable approach to patient record access that meets minimum requirements without demonstrating meaningful investment in the patient self-access experience.

# Minnie Hamilton Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Minnie Hamilton Health System (MHHS) is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Grantsville, West Virginia, affiliated with Mon Health. The organization does not publish any downloadable ROI or patient access form on its website. Instead, it directs all medical records requests through ChartRequest, a third-party online portal. Two documents were downloaded during this evaluation: a patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) and a Mon Health Medical Center authorization form (form-2.pdf) from the affiliate system — neither is an MHHS-branded records request form.

## Access Pathway

MHHS routes patients to ChartRequest (https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville) for medical records requests. This is an online portal where the authorization form is embedded in the electronic workflow. While portal-based submission is inherently electronic and potentially convenient, ChartRequest requires account creation before a patient can even see the authorization form or understand the terms of the request. This creates opacity — patients cannot preview the form, understand fee structures, or assess what information they'll need to provide before committing to a third-party account.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ChartRequest portal appears to be a general records release platform, not a pathway specifically designed for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. There is no publicly visible indication that MHHS has a separate, streamlined process for patients requesting their own records.

MHHS also maintains an Athena Health patient portal for clinical messaging, but the only downloaded document about it (form-1.pdf) covers sending documents *to* providers — the opposite direction of a records request. Whether a patient could request records through a portal message is unclear; the website directs records requests exclusively through ChartRequest.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding records request information for MHHS was **hard**. An extensive search process — multiple query variations, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine CDX API queries, and direct website navigation — failed to surface any downloadable ROI form. The MHHS website has no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. The website does link to ChartRequest from the patients page, but there is no standalone form to evaluate. The Mon Health authorization form (form-2.pdf) was located only by broadening the search to the affiliate system and is branded exclusively for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — a separate facility approximately 150 miles away.

## Form Document Quality

Because MHHS does not publish a standalone form, there is no primary form to assess for document quality in the traditional sense. The ChartRequest portal workflow could not be evaluated without creating an account. The Mon Health form (form-2.pdf), while not applicable to MHHS, provides the closest reference point: it is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) with dense content, a 4.1 MB file size (extremely bloated with 40 embedded images and 107 fonts), and no instructions for patients. It is a generic third-party authorization form that includes "Personal Use" as one purpose option but is not designed around patient self-access.

The patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) is well-written with numbered steps and plain language, suggesting MHHS is capable of producing clear patient-facing materials — but this capability was not applied to the records request process.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The primary barrier is **gatekeeping behind account creation**. Patients must create a ChartRequest account before they can access the authorization form or learn anything about the records request process. For patients with limited internet access or digital literacy — a real concern in rural Grantsville, WV — this is a significant obstacle. There is no phone-based or paper-based alternative publicly documented on the website, though the medical records department phone number (304-354-9700, ext. 2521) is listed.

No fee information is publicly available. No response time commitment is published. No patient rights information is accessible before engaging with the ChartRequest platform. The lack of any publicly visible authorization terms means patients cannot make informed decisions about the process before entering it.

## Strengths

- **Electronic submission pathway**: The ChartRequest portal provides a fully digital workflow, eliminating the need for printing, faxing, or mailing paper forms.
- **Digital-first approach**: MHHS has adopted modern platforms (Athena Health portal, ChartRequest) rather than relying solely on paper-based processes.
- **Clear instructional writing**: The patient portal guide demonstrates an ability to produce accessible, well-structured patient materials.

## Overall Assessment

Minnie Hamilton Health System presents a paradox: it has adopted a modern electronic records request platform, but in doing so has made the process less transparent and less accessible than many organizations that simply post a PDF form. The complete absence of a publicly available authorization form, fee schedule, timeline, or patient rights information means that MHHS patients enter the records request process with no visibility into what to expect. The reliance on a third-party platform with mandatory account creation creates an unnecessary gatekeeping barrier, particularly problematic for a rural critical access hospital serving a population that may have limited internet access. While the ChartRequest workflow may be well-designed internally, the opaque exterior facing patients undermines what could otherwise be a modern, patient-friendly approach.

# MountainView Hospital (Las Vegas, NV) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MountainView Hospital is part of HCA Healthcare's Sunrise Health network in Las Vegas. The facility's own domain (`mountainview-hospital.com`) redirects to the Sunrise Health system website at `sunrisehealthinfo.com`, where all medical records information is centralized. Two PDF forms were found—an English and Spanish version of the same standardized HCA Healthcare authorization form—alongside references to two additional digital pathways: an online Swellbox records request portal and the MyHealthONE patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The medical records page at sunrisehealthinfo.com offers three pathways for patients requesting records: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (in English and Spanish), (2) an online request wizard via Swellbox, and (3) the MyHealthONE patient portal. The primary downloadable form (form-1.pdf, HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21) is a system-wide HCA Healthcare standardized authorization used across all HCA facilities, not specific to MountainView Hospital. The Swellbox portal represents the most streamlined digital option, though the PDF form remains the most prominently linked resource.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MountainView Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves both patient self-requests and third-party release, with a radio-button choice between "At the request of the individual" and "Other 3rd party recipient." While a patient *can* use this form to request their own records, the form's framing—with prominent "Recipient" fields, fax-to-provider-only restrictions, and third-party disclosure language—is clearly oriented toward release-of-information scenarios rather than individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. The form makes no distinction between Right of Access fee limits/timelines and general authorization practices.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was relatively easy. The medical records page is accessible via the main navigation ("For Patients → Medical Records"), and the authorization forms are directly linked with clear labels. The one complication was bot protection: curl requests to the initial download URL returned HTML rather than a PDF, requiring discovery of the actual CDN URL at `hcadam.com`. This is a minor technical obstacle that wouldn't affect a patient using a browser.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a single-page, fully interactive PDF with 52 fillable fields—patients can complete it digitally without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (patient/recipient info, marketing/PHI sale, signatures), with 16 specific record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. Four delivery format options are offered: paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure). The form also includes a rare USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release option, a forward-looking feature for structured data export.

However, the single-page constraint makes the layout quite dense, and some terminology (USCDI, Direct Address, NPI) is jargon that would be opaque to most patients. The language is a mix of plain language and legalese—the six "I understand that..." statements are reasonably clear, but the overall form assumes familiarity with medical records processes.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked optional but unnecessary for records authorization and a data minimization concern.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form states patients may obtain copies "for a reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts, and this language appears in a rights statement that could normalize fee collection even for Right of Access requests.
- **Fax restriction**: "(FAX only to Physician Office / Medical facility)" limits fax delivery destinations and may restrict patient choice.
- **No notarization or witness required**—a positive.
- **No in-person requirement**: Mail, fax, and online portal options are all available.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual**: Full Spanish translation (form-2.pdf) available alongside the English version—meaningful for Las Vegas's significant Spanish-speaking population, though the surrounding web pages remain English-only and some form footer elements were left untranslated.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare and forward-looking inclusion of interoperability standards on an ROI form.
- **Multiple electronic delivery choices**: Four format options with honest risk disclosures.
- **Alternative digital pathways**: Swellbox portal and MyHealthONE patient portal provide additional request channels beyond the PDF.
- **52 fillable fields**: Fully digital-first form design.

## Overall Assessment

MountainView Hospital, through HCA Healthcare's standardized forms and Sunrise Health's website, provides a reasonably accessible records request experience. The form is easy to find, technically well-built, and offers meaningful delivery format choices. The main weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway—patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization form that doesn't distinguish Right of Access rights, fee limits, or timelines. The availability of the Swellbox online portal and MyHealthONE partially compensates for this gap by offering alternative digital pathways. The form earns credit for its fillable design, Spanish availability, and USCDI awareness, but loses points for its generic framing, fee ambiguity, and unnecessary SSN collection.

# Garfield Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Garfield Medical Center (GMC), a for-profit community hospital in Monterey Park, CA, operated by AHMC Healthcare Inc., provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URL paths on the AHMC website. Neither form is specifically designed for patient self-access; both are general-purpose "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" documents that serve third-party release and personal use alike.

## Access Pathway

GMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient requesting their own records must use the same authorization form designed for release to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. The form includes "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox, and a patient could fill in their own name in the "Release To" field, but the framing is clearly oriented toward third-party disclosure ("I authorize Garfield Medical Center to Release Medical records to: Person/Organization"). There is no online portal, no digital request wizard, and no separate patient access request form.

That said, the form does include an "Inspect or Review Medical Record" option alongside copies, acknowledging the patient's right to review records in person — a positive touch that many facilities omit.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, login requirements, or browser workarounds needed. Both form versions were indexed and accessible via descriptive URLs. The only minor confusion is that two near-identical forms exist at different paths (`/gmc/documents/` and `/gmc/docs/`), both marked "Revised 9/21." A patient discovering both would have no clear way to determine which is authoritative.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — **not** a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand despite its digital origin. This is a significant missed opportunity: the form was clearly authored in a word processor but exported without interactive fields.

The layout is well-organized, following a logical flow: Patient Information → Release To → Purpose → Information to Be Released → Delivery Instructions → Notice of Rights → Term → Signature. Section headers are clear and distinct. The form offers impressive granularity in record type selection (12+ specific categories plus "ALL RECORDS") and provides multiple delivery options including email with a dedicated address field.

Language is generally accessible, using an "I understand that..." format for patient rights. However, legal references to California Health and Safety Code sections are included without plain-language explanation. The opening line — "Failure to provide all information may invalidate this authorization" — sets an intimidating tone, and it is unclear which fields are truly mandatory.

## Barriers & Concerns

- **CD liability waiver bundled into authorization:** All patients must waive liability for CD release as part of signing the form, even when not requesting imaging on CD. This is consent bundling.
- **Fees disclosed without amounts:** The form references California fee statutes but provides no specific costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate expenses.
- **Revocation limited to postal mail:** Revoking authorization requires a signed letter mailed to the Privacy Officer — no fax, email, or in-person option.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive absence.
- **Submission methods:** The form lists fax (626-307-2186), mail, email, pick-up, and hand delivery. Fax and email availability mean a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery option** with a dedicated field — uncommon among ROI forms.
- **"Inspect or Review" checkbox** alongside copies — acknowledges the HIPAA right to review.
- **Granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control.
- **Clear treatment non-conditionality statement** and 180-day expiration with patient override.

## Overall Assessment

Garfield Medical Center provides a reasonably well-structured authorization form that is easy to find and offers useful features like email delivery and record type granularity. However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form, lacking fillable fields, and bundling a CD liability waiver. The absence of a dedicated patient access pathway and the non-fillable PDF format are the most significant gaps. The facility meets the baseline for electronic submission (fax and email are available) but offers no modern digital workflow.

# Owensboro Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Owensboro Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Owensboro, Kentucky, operating three hospitals (Regional Hospital, Muhlenberg Community Hospital, and Twin Lakes Medical Center) plus a medical group. The organization provides a single, system-wide "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Health Information" form (form-1) accompanied by a dedicated plain-language instruction sheet (form-2). Both documents are easily accessible online.

## Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved, both directly downloadable PDFs:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary ROI authorization form (2 pages). This is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Patients check "Me" as recipient and "Patient Request" as purpose to request their own records.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A companion instruction document (2 pages) explaining each section of the form in plain language, with submission addresses, fax numbers, and an email address.

Submission options include mail, fax, and email (himroi@owensborohealth.org for the main hospital), providing adequate electronic submission pathways. MyChart is also referenced as both a format and delivery option, indicating a patient portal pathway exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Owensboro Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves all purposes — patient requests, legal/attorney, insurance, and third-party release. However, the form does clearly accommodate patient self-access: "Me" is a prominently positioned recipient checkbox, "Patient Request" is a reason option, and the instruction document is written from the patient's perspective ("If you are wanting to receive your records check the box labeled 'Me'"). The dual-purpose design means patients must navigate fields intended for third-party release (recipient address, legal representative sections) and understand which parts apply to them, but the instruction sheet mitigates this confusion substantially.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. A simple web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's medical records page also surfaces both documents. No login walls, bot blocking, or CAPTCHAs were encountered. This earns a top findability score.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form has a proper text layer but **zero fillable fields** — all data entry areas are underscored blank lines and non-interactive checkboxes. This is a print-and-fill document. A patient must print, handwrite, and then fax, mail, or email a scan. The layout is logically organized across 2 pages with clear section headers and a reasonable field count (~15-18 fields). Language is a mix of plain English and necessary legal terminology; the companion instruction document compensates by restating everything in plain language.

The form offers an unusually comprehensive set of format options (Paper, MyChart, EHI Export, Email, Fax, CD, USB) and delivery methods (Mail, Pickup, Fax, MyChart, encrypted email, unencrypted email with risk warning). The explicit inclusion of **EHI Export** with a detailed explanation — covering all ePHI across the organization and named Community Connect Partners, delivered in TSV format — is rare and exemplary.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Multiple submission channels (mail, fax, email) are available. No fees are mentioned on the form or instructions, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs but not actively deterred. The 120-day authorization expiration is appropriate for third-party releases but is technically unnecessary for patient self-access under HIPAA § 164.524, which grants an ongoing right. The "Your Rights" section covers voluntariness, right to revoke, right to inspect, and re-disclosure risk — a solid rights statement.

## Notable Strengths

- **EHI Export option**: Explicitly offered with named partner organizations and format details — well ahead of industry norms.
- **Companion instruction document**: A dedicated 2-page plain-language guide is an uncommon and patient-friendly practice.
- **Comprehensive delivery options**: Seven format choices and six delivery methods, including encrypted/unencrypted email with clear risk disclosure.
- **Help phone number**: The instruction document closes with a direct number for assistance.

## Weaknesses

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields despite having a digital text layer — a missed opportunity for a fully digital workflow.
- **No pathway differentiation**: Patient self-access is routed through the same authorization form as third-party releases.
- **No fee transparency**: Neither document mentions whether fees apply to patient access requests.
- **120-day expiration**: Applied broadly, including to patient self-access requests where it is legally unnecessary.

## Overall Assessment

Owensboro Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its comprehensive format/delivery options, EHI Export transparency, and companion instruction document. The main limitations are the non-fillable PDF format and the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization. For a community hospital system, this is a well-above-average effort that could reach excellence with fillable form fields and a patient-specific access process.

# Decatur County Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Decatur County Hospital (Leon, IA) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in rural Iowa. The facility offers a single authorization form — "Authorization for Access, Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (DCH-#0001) — for all medical records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway; the same generic HIPAA authorization form serves both patients requesting their own records and third-party release scenarios.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form's opening language reads: "I, the undersigned authorize and request Decatur County Hospital to: Allow access, use or disclosure of my protected health information to: OR obtain from:" — presenting patient access and third-party release as two branches of the same document. A patient simply wanting to view or obtain copies of their own records must navigate fields designed for third-party recipients (recipient organization, address, fax number) that are irrelevant to their situation. The form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox, which is the closest it comes to acknowledging individual access rights, but there is no explicit reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524. No patient portal-based records request workflow or online submission mechanism was identified.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. While initial broad web searches failed, a site-scoped search quickly located the PDF linked from the hospital's Patient Portal page. The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0001-Auth-for-Access-Use-or-Disclosure-of-PHI.pdf`) is descriptive, and no bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. For a small rural hospital, the form's online availability is commendable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a genuine bright spot in terms of technical design. Created with Acrobat PDFMaker for Word, it is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 61 AcroForm interactive fields — covering patient demographics, record type checkboxes, purpose options, sensitive-records initials, fee agreement, and signatures. Nearly every blank on the form can be completed electronically without printing. However, AcroForm field names are empty, which would hinder screen reader accessibility.

The form fits everything onto a single page — admirably compact but visually dense. The logical flow is sound (patient identity → recipient → dates → record types → purpose → sensitive records → fees → legal text → signature), but cramming 61 fields, 13 record-type checkboxes, and multiple legal paragraphs onto one page likely challenges readability. The first half uses straightforward language, while the second half descends into dense regulatory prose, particularly the re-disclosure paragraph citing 42 CFR Part 2 and Iowa Code chapters 228 and 141.

Record-type granularity is a strength: patients can select from 13 specific categories (Discharge Summary, H&P, Consultation, Radiology, Progress Notes, OR Report, Pathology, Labs, ER Notes, EKG, PT/OT/ST, Photographs) plus "Other" and a "Review only" option. This gives patients meaningful control over scope.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Social Security Number**: The form requests SSN — unnecessary for patient identification under HIPAA and a significant identity-theft risk on a form that may be faxed or mailed. A medical record number (included as "for office use only") is sufficient.

**Blank fee amount**: The fee disclosure states the hospital "may impose a fee of [blank]" and asks patients to agree to unspecified costs. This prevents patients from making informed decisions about fees before submitting their request.

**No delivery format options**: The form lacks any field for patients to specify how they want to receive records (mail, electronic, in-person). HIPAA § 164.524(c)(2)(i) requires entities to provide records in the form and format requested if readily producible.

**Outdated**: Last reviewed March 2018 — nearly eight years old, predating the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective 2021).

**Binding language**: The statement that authorization provisions "take precedence over statements made in the Decatur County Hospital's Notice of Privacy Practices" is potentially misleading, suggesting patients might be waiving protections.

## Strengths

The form includes an explicit conditioning prohibition (treatment will not be conditioned on signing), clear revocation instructions with a mailing address, and appropriate separate-initials requirements for sensitive records (substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS) under applicable federal and state law. The comprehensive record-type granularity and digital-first fillable design are notable positives.

## Overall Assessment

Decatur County Hospital provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records access. The fillable PDF is technically sound, but the generic authorization approach, SSN collection, blank fee amount, outdated review date, and absence of delivery format options collectively place this facility below the standard patients should expect for exercising their individual access rights.

# Duke University Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Duke Health provides four documents related to records release. The most relevant for a patient requesting their own records is **form-4.pdf** (M3132, Rev. 3/2025), the current enterprise-wide Authorization for Release of Information. This is a single-page, fillable PDF with 67 interactive fields, hosted on a well-organized medical records landing page. The companion **form-2.pdf** is a 3-page plain-language instruction sheet walking patients through each section of the authorization. Form-1 is an older revision of the same M3132 form (Rev. 4/2024) that remains accessible at a stale URL, and form-3 is an image-only scan of an even older revision posted on a satellite Duke outpatient clinic site — both are superseded and inferior to form-4.

Duke also mentions that Spanish-language versions are available on the official forms page, and the forms page links to additional documents (verbal release form, proxy access form, external records request).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Duke does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The M3132 authorization is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to serve both patient self-requests and third-party releases (attorneys, insurers, other providers). However, the form accommodates patient access reasonably well: Part B includes a "Self (Same Info As Above)" checkbox, Part D lists "Personal" as the first purpose option, and Part E prominently features "My Duke Health (Patients Only)" as a delivery method. The companion instructions explicitly address patients requesting their own records ("If you are the patient and are requesting the records be sent to you, select 'Self'"). While functional, a patient must still navigate sections designed for third-party scenarios, and the form doesn't distinguish the differing legal frameworks (Right of Access vs. Authorization) that apply to each case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy** — rated as a 2-click path from the Duke Health homepage (Medical Records → Authorization Forms). The official forms page is clearly titled, well-organized, and lists all available downloads. Web searches readily surface direct PDF URLs. The only retrieval concern is stale URLs: the older form-1 revision remains accessible via search engines, and a satellite Duke site hosts an image-only scan (form-3) that was uploaded as recently as June 2024 despite being from 2022.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the current primary form, is a strong digital-first artifact. It contains **67 fillable interactive fields** on a single page — enabling patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing. The layout follows a logical six-part structure (Patient Info → Recipient → Records to Release → Purpose → Delivery Format → Review/Approval) with clear section headers. The record-type selection offers excellent granularity: 14+ individual report categories, treatment date ranges, and facility-specific or enterprise-wide options. Sensible defaults are transparently stated ("Last 2 years of active treatment will be provided unless specified"). The language is generally clear and functional, though the legal disclosure text in Part F is dense. The companion instruction document (form-2) defines each medical record type in accessible language — an unusually thorough support resource.

## Barriers and Concerns

Duke imposes no notarization requirement; the witness section from the older revision has been removed entirely. Submission channels are robust: email, fax, and mail, with a phone number for questions. No in-person requirement exists. However, several issues merit attention:

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number — not required by HIPAA and an unnecessary privacy risk when medical record number and date of birth are also collected.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Duke Health may charge a fee" with "Charges may apply" noted for CD and paper delivery, but no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Patients must affirmatively check boxes for Mental/Behavioral Health and Genetic Testing to receive those portions of their own records — arguably a barrier for patient self-access, where HIPAA grants access to the complete designated record set. The form mentions HIV/AIDS in the text but provides no corresponding checkbox, creating ambiguity.
- **Unnamed form fields**: All 67 fillable fields lack descriptive names, creating an accessibility gap for screen reader users.

## Strengths

Duke excels in several areas: multiple electronic delivery options (MyChart patient portal, encrypted email, fax), granular record-type selection, companion instructions with plain-language medical definitions, multiple submission channels, and a clean digital-first form design. The existence of a separate instruction document with a helpline number demonstrates genuine investment in patient guidance. Electronic delivery options are listed first in Part E, signaling a preference for digital fulfillment.

## Overall Assessment

Duke University Hospital provides a well-organized, technically competent records request experience anchored by a strong fillable PDF form and excellent companion documentation. The primary limitation is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization designed for all release scenarios. The form handles patient self-requests adequately through its "Self" checkbox and "Personal" purpose option, but doesn't inform patients of their Right of Access or distinguish the simpler patient-access legal framework from third-party authorization. Minor concerns around SSN collection, vague fee disclosure, and sensitive-information opt-in prevent a top-tier rating, but overall this is an above-average experience.

# Phelps Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Memorial Health Center is a small independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Holdrege, Nebraska. The organization offers a single ROI form — a one-page "Request for Release of Information" — that serves as the sole documented pathway for patients requesting their medical records. No patient portal–based request option, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway

Phelps Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization used for all purposes — releasing records to another provider, to a third party, or to the patient themselves. "Patient" appears as one of three checkbox options under "Release Records To" (alongside "Provider/Hospital" and "Other Person"), and an in-person inspection option is included, but there is no dedicated workflow or separate form for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as an attorney or insurer, selecting the applicable checkboxes and ignoring fields meant for third-party recipients.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was **easy to find via web search** — a basic query for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned a direct link to the PDF. However, the form is **not linked from the organization's patient forms page**, which only lists a Patient History Form and New Patient Form. A patient browsing the website through normal navigation would not discover the ROI form. The PDF is hosted at a raw Drupal file path with no landing page or contextual instructions.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but with zero interactive form fields. All blanks are underscored lines intended for handwriting. The form must be printed, filled out by hand, and returned via fax (two fax numbers are listed in the footer) or in person. No electronic fill-and-submit workflow exists.

**Layout and organization** are logical — the form flows top-to-bottom from patient identification through record source, recipient, purpose, record type selection, legal language, and signature. However, the single page is moderately cramped, and administrative fields ("Release completed by:", "MR #:") appear prominently at the top, potentially confusing patients who may think they need to fill them in.

**Language** is mixed: the top half uses plain, accessible phrasing with straightforward checkboxes, while the bottom half presents dense legal paragraphs covering HIPAA rights, revocation, treatment conditioning, and sensitive information disclosures. The legal text includes a factual error — citing "Health Information Portability and Accountability Act" instead of the correct "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no unreasonable barriers**: no notarization or witness required, no in-person-only submission (fax is available), and appropriate anti-conditioning language is included with a specific HIPAA citation (§ 164.508). Fee disclosure is transparent and reasonable — first 10 pages are free, $0.25/page thereafter, $10 for CD — which is more generous than many providers. The form also includes a "COMPLETE HEALTH RECORD" checkbox, simplifying requests for patients who want everything.

Concerns include the **calendar-year expiration** ("Release effective until the end of this year"), which creates an inconsistent authorization window depending on when the patient signs. The form is dated August 2017 and has not been updated in over eight years, raising questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **First 10 pages free**: Reduces cost burden for routine patient access requests.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Accomplishes a complete ROI authorization concisely.
- **"Complete Health Record" option**: Lets patients request everything without needing to select individual categories.
- **Anti-conditioning language**: Explicitly states treatment cannot be conditioned on signing.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields**: Entirely print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Not linked from website navigation**: Findable only via search engine.
- **Generic form for all purposes**: No differentiation for patient self-access.
- **HIPAA name error and outdated form**: Suggests lack of recent legal review.
- **Staff fields on patient-facing form**: "Release completed by" and "MR #" may confuse patients.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Memorial Health Center provides a functional but basic records request process. The single-page form is efficient and the fee structure is patient-friendly, but the lack of fillable fields, absence from website navigation, and failure to distinguish patient access from third-party release place this organization squarely in the middle tier. The form gets the job done but reflects a paper-era workflow that has not been updated to serve the modern patient experience. **Grade: C.**

# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Three PDF forms were found for Carle BroMenn Medical Center, a community hospital in Normal, IL that is part of the Carle Health regional system:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary general ROI authorization form specific to the BroMenn/Normal campus (form code X3833-0820). One page. Covers Carle West Physician Group, Carle BroMenn Medical Center, and Carle Eureka Hospital.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A nearly identical system-level Carle Health ROI form for the Champaign campus (form code 174-0319). One page. Same structure but branded for the main Carle campus HIM department.
3. **form-3.pdf** — A behavioral health–specific authorization form for the BroMenn campus (form code X3852-0620). Two pages. Required separately for mental health records per Illinois law.

**Form-1 is the most relevant document** for a patient at Carle BroMenn Medical Center requesting their own general medical records. Form-2 serves the Champaign campus and would likely confuse a BroMenn patient. Form-3 is a companion form needed only for behavioral health records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Carle BroMenn does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" documents designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios. The form uses "To Send to" / "To Request from" framing, requiring patients to navigate a form designed for inter-provider transfers, legal disclosures, and insurance requests. There is no streamlined form or process specifically for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

That said, the form does include some patient-oriented elements: delivery via MyCarle Account (the patient portal), an explicit citation of CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access regulation), and a clear statement that signing is not required for treatment.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches surfaced direct PDF download links on carle.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or multi-step navigation was required. The carle.org medical records page links to the forms. All three were directly downloadable via curl. The only minor friction: a patient might encounter both form-1 (BroMenn-specific) and form-2 (Champaign-specific) without clear guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **digitally-authored but non-fillable PDF**. Despite being created digitally (not a scan), it has zero interactive form fields — every field must be filled by hand after printing. This is a significant missed opportunity. The form is well-organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of release → delivery method → record type selection → legal terms → signature. The granular record-type checkbox grid (30+ categories across hospitalization and clinic columns) gives patients meaningful control over scope. However, the single-page design makes the form cramped, with small font (estimated 8–9pt for legal text) and limited write-in space.

The language is a mix of clear and legalistic. Legal disclaimers are reasonably comprehensible but dense. The "ATTENTION: This is a legal document" warning is somewhat intimidating. There is no plain-language summary.

## Barriers

- **Purpose of disclosure required**: The form requires patients to state why they want their records — a requirement that is potentially non-compliant with HIPAA's Right of Access, which prohibits requiring a reason for patient self-access requests.
- **SSN field not marked optional**: Asks for last 4 digits of SSN without indicating it can be left blank.
- **Paper-only workflow**: No fillable fields, no fax number for submission, no email submission. A patient must print, handwrite, and mail the form or deliver it in person.
- **Behavioral health witness requirement**: Form-3 requires a witness signature for both the authorization and revocation — a barrier not required by HIPAA.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: States "there may be a charge" with no amounts. Form-3 mentions ScanStat as the third-party vendor processing requests.
- **No notarization required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — mail is an option.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyCarle Account electronic delivery** for records (30-day window) provides a digital delivery pathway even though the request itself is paper-based.
- **Explicit HIPAA citation** (CFR 164.524) — uncommon and commendable transparency about patient rights.
- **Granular record-type selection** gives patients fine-grained control over what is released.
- **Easy online findability** of forms with direct download links.
- **Appropriate behavioral health protections** including 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language and age-appropriate consent (12+ for mental health).

## Overall Assessment

Carle BroMenn Medical Center provides a functional but dated records request process. The forms are easy to find and reasonably well-organized, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of electronic submission options, and generic authorization design that doesn't differentiate patient self-access from third-party release hold it back. The purpose-of-disclosure requirement is a compliance concern for patient access requests. The organization earns credit for MyCarle Account delivery, explicit rights citations, and granular scope controls, but the fundamentally paper-based workflow and generic form design place it in the middle of the pack for patient-centeredness.

# Boone County Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Boone County Health Center (BCHC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Albion, Nebraska. The organization provides a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests — there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway. Three documents were found: the current ROI form (form-2), a superseded 2017 version (form-1), and a HIPAA Contact Information form (form-3) that is explicitly not an ROI substitute.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The primary and only ROI form is form-2, "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information," uploaded in February 2026 as a Microsoft Word .docx file. This replaced an older PDF version (form-1, August 2017) that remains accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the website. The current form is a generic authorization that handles both outbound release ("Release Information To") and inbound record requests ("Obtain Records From") through a single check-one mechanism. While a "Patient Request" purpose checkbox exists, the form does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party authorization, and makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — basic web searches surfaced both the old and new versions, and the current form is listed on the Patient Forms section under Patient Resources > General Information. The main complication is that the current form is published only as a .docx file, which is unusual and less accessible than PDF. The website also requires JavaScript rendering to display form links. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page document with a logical flow: patient identification, release direction, purpose, date range, record types, sensitive information authorization, delivery format, legal acknowledgments, and signatures. It has zero fillable fields — all inputs are underscore blank lines, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The .docx format theoretically allows typing, but without proper form fields the experience is poor.

The layout is reasonably organized with clear sections, though the release direction framing ("Release Information To" vs. "Obtain Records From") is confusing for patients who simply want their own records. The sensitive information section has garbled instruction text from formatting issues. Language is generally plain and accessible, with concise legal acknowledgments. There are no instructions explaining how to submit the completed form, though the header provides phone, fax, and a dedicated ROI email address (Roi@boonecohealth.org).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is required. Fee disclosure is vague — the form states "copy fees may apply in accordance with Nebraska law" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access and third-party fees. A photo ID/witness requirement appears on the signature line but its scope is ambiguous — it may apply only to in-person pickup. The form includes a proper non-coercion statement, re-disclosure warning, 12-month fixed expiration, and revocation rights. No turnaround time is stated. A typo ("Heath" instead of "Health") appears in the legal section.

Submission methods include fax (402-395-2180), potentially email (Roi@boonecohealth.org is listed but not explicitly stated as a submission channel), mail, and in-person delivery. Fax availability means electronic submission is possible without visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

BCHC shows several bright spots unusual for a small critical access hospital: a dedicated ROI email address suggesting a staffed intake process, encrypted email as a delivery format option, and careful handling of sensitive information categories with separate initials required for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV/AIDS records per Nebraska law. The form is compact (2 pages) and avoids excessive legalese.

## Notable Weaknesses

The .docx-only publication format is a meaningful accessibility barrier. The lack of fillable fields means this is fundamentally a paper workflow. The generic authorization framing without any acknowledgment of patient access rights under HIPAA means a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for third-party release. The continued availability of the superseded 2017 form at its original URL creates confusion risk.

## Overall Assessment

Boone County Health Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is findable and the content is adequate, but it reflects a traditional paper-centric approach with no digital-first design or patient access differentiation. The bright spots — dedicated email, encrypted delivery, compact design — show genuine effort, but the .docx format, lack of fillable fields, and generic authorization framing hold back the overall experience. A patient can get the job done, but must figure out the process largely on their own.

# Advocare, LLC — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Advocare, LLC provides three downloaded authorization forms and an online submission alternative:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): The current English-language "Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information," a 2-page fillable PDF with 41 interactive fields, revised January 2026. Linked directly from the official medical records page.
- **form-3.pdf**: A Spanish-language translation of the same authorization form, dated January 2024, with 44 fillable fields. Also linked from the medical records page.
- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An older single-page version (v2, April 2021) found on a different CDN path, likely from an individual practice sub-site. It has zero fillable fields and includes a Social Security Number field that the current version removed.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, Advocare's medical records page offers an **online request option via ShareCare** and a separate third-party requester portal. The PDF forms list mail and email as delivery options, and fax is implicitly available through their practice offices.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocare does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release. All three PDF forms are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for disclosure to third parties. However, form-2 includes a **"Patient Request" checkbox** under the purpose field, acknowledging patient-initiated requests. The structural awkwardness remains: a patient requesting their own records must still fill out "recipient" fields, essentially listing themselves as the party receiving disclosure. This is a common industry pattern but reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-access-first design.

The ShareCare online portal provides an alternative pathway, though it was not evaluated as a downloaded form in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Advocare's forms was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page, which clearly links to downloadable PDFs in English and Spanish, the ShareCare online portal, and a third-party requester portal. No bot blocking, authentication, or browser workarounds were needed. The only minor issue is that the legacy form-1.pdf remains discoverable via web search, creating a risk that patients could find and submit an outdated document.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2.pdf is a **born-digital, fillable PDF** with 41 interactive fields — a significant improvement over the legacy form-1 (which had zero fillable fields). The layout follows a logical flow: patient demographics → sending/receiving provider → purpose → date range → record types → sensitive categories → attestation → signature. The two-column sender/recipient layout is efficient, and the form includes 12 record-type checkboxes plus an "Abstract Record" shortcut (last year of encounters and results).

The language is a mix of standard HIPAA authorization phrasing and reasonably clear instructions. While not truly plain-language, it is accessible to most adults. One notable defect: the PDF contains a duplicated/garbled heading ("Select from thethe following...") — a layout error. The fillable fields also lack accessible names, which would impact screen reader users.

The Spanish version (form-3) is a high-quality professional translation with fillable fields, though it lacks the email delivery option present in the English form — a functional parity gap.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **No in-person submission requirement** — mail, email, and online (ShareCare) are available.
- **No fees disclosed** on the form — neither good nor bad, but not transparent.
- **No SSN field** on the current form (the legacy form-1 did collect SSN — a red flag that was corrected).
- **90-day default expiration** is shorter than the industry-typical 6 months, potentially requiring re-authorization if processing is slow.
- **30-day response timeline** is clearly stated, correctly reflecting HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering a professionally translated Spanish form alongside English is uncommon and valuable, especially in a Northeast practice.
- **"Abstract Record" option**: Provides a practical shortcut for patients who want a summary without selecting individual record types.
- **Reference Guide**: Page 2 defines sensitive information categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, reproductive services) in plain language with NJ law citations.
- **Email delivery option**: Explicitly offers electronic delivery alongside mail.
- **Online submission via ShareCare**: Provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Overall Assessment

Advocare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an independent physician practice. Forms are easy to find, fillable, available in two languages, and offer electronic submission. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must navigate a general-purpose authorization form designed around third-party disclosure. The "Patient Request" checkbox partially addresses this, but the form's structure still assumes a sender-to-recipient model that doesn't map cleanly to individual access rights. This is a solid B-level performance: competent, accessible, and showing genuine attention to patient needs, with room for improvement in truly centering the patient access experience.

# GI Alliance — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

GI Alliance is a large, for-profit physician practice management organization headquartered in Southlake, TX, operating dozens of affiliated gastroenterology practices nationwide. Three forms were retrieved: one text-based authorization form from the main gialliance.com website (form-1), and two image-only scanned forms from affiliate practices Granite Peaks GI (form-2) and University GI (form-3). Form-1 is the canonical, centrally published document and represents the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Dedicated Patient Route

GI Alliance does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information," while forms 2 and 3 are explicitly titled "Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party." None reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or acknowledge the distinct legal framework for patient self-access versus third-party authorization (§ 164.508).

Form-1 does include a "at Patient's request" checkbox under the purpose section, making it technically usable for patient-directed requests, but the form structure — requiring a recipient address, lacking delivery format preferences, and using authorization language throughout — treats the patient as just another requester rather than an individual exercising a legal right. This conflation could cause the organization to inadvertently apply third-party authorization rules (higher fees, broader denial grounds) to patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the primary form was relatively straightforward. A site-specific web search surfaced form-1 directly at a WordPress uploads URL. GI Alliance maintains a patient forms page at `gialliance.com/patient-forms-and-prep/`, but it is organized by local brand/location, adding navigational complexity for patients who must first identify their affiliate practice. The affiliate forms (forms 2 and 3) required searching beyond the main domain. No login wall, bot blocking, or portal gating was encountered. Retrieval difficulty: easy for the main form, moderate for the affiliate variants.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available document, is a single-page text-based PDF authored digitally in Microsoft Word — a significant quality advantage over the affiliate scans. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are rendered as underscores, requiring the patient to print and handwrite. There is no electronic signature capability and no submit button. The form must be printed, completed by hand, and returned — but critically, **no submission method is specified anywhere on the form** (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link). A patient who downloads this form has no way to know where to send it without calling the organization.

The layout is logical, following standard authorization flow: patient identification → recipient → scope → sensitive categories → purpose → duration/revocation → signature. However, there are no bold section headers, no instructional text, and the language is moderately legalistic (e.g., "d/b/a GI Alliance on behalf of itself and all other practices that are operating as a single HIPAA Affiliated Covered Entity"). The form is concise at one page, which is a positive.

The affiliate forms (2 and 3) are substantially worse in quality: form-2 is a browser print-to-PDF with a completely garbled text layer (broken Type 3 font encoding), and form-3 is a raw scan with no text layer at all. Both are inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally. Form-3 appears to be truncated, missing required HIPAA authorization elements like the signature block and revocation instructions.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blank provider identity**: Form-1 leaves both the authorizing entity name and the revocation mailing address as blank fill-ins, creating a functional barrier for patients who don't know which affiliate practice to name.
- **No submission instructions**: None of the three forms specify where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees or the patient's right to cost-based pricing under HIPAA.
- **No processing timeline**: No indication of how long records fulfillment will take.
- **SSN collection**: Forms 2 and 3 request the last four digits of SSN — unnecessary for HIPAA record requests and a potential deterrent.
- **No delivery format options**: Form-1 does not ask how the patient wants to receive records; forms 2 and 3 offer only "E-Delivery" and "Mail."

## Bright Spots

- **Sensitive information categories**: Form-1 requires separate initials for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance use, and genetic information — a compliance-conscious design respecting state-level protections.
- **Explicit non-conditioning statement**: The clear declaration that treatment/payment won't be conditioned on signing is present and well-stated.
- **Concise format**: Form-1 covers all essential elements on a single page without being excessively dense.
- **Granular record selection** (affiliate forms): Forms 2 and 3 offer 9-10 specific record-type checkboxes, giving patients meaningful control over what information is released.

## Overall Assessment

GI Alliance provides a minimally adequate but patient-unfriendly records request experience. The organization channels all access requests — whether from patients, insurers, or attorneys — through a single generic authorization framework with no acknowledgment that patient self-access is a distinct right with its own legal protections. The primary form is digitally authored but not fillable, includes no submission instructions, and leaves critical fields (provider name, revocation address) blank. A patient attempting to request their own records online would download a form they cannot fill digitally, would not know where to send it, and would receive no guidance about fees, timelines, or their rights. The experience reflects organizational indifference to patient self-service rather than intentional obstruction.

# Prevea Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Prevea Health is an independent nonprofit physician practice based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It offers a single authorization form — an "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (PRV_839, rev. 0118) — as its primary mechanism for patients to request their own medical records. The same form is available in four languages: English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. No separate patient access–specific form or online portal was identified.

## Access Pathway

Prevea Health uses a **generic HIPAA authorization form** rather than a dedicated patient access form. However, the form explicitly accommodates patient self-requests: Section 3 ("To Disclose To") includes a "Self" checkbox with delivery options (pick up, mail, on-site viewing, electronic format, and email with encrypted/unencrypted options). Section 7 ("Purpose") includes "Patient Request" as a named checkbox option. While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, the form clearly signals that patients can use it for their own records — placing it above average among generic authorization forms.

The form does not differentiate the legal basis for patient self-access (HIPAA § 164.524) from third-party release (§ 164.508), but the practical workflow is reasonably clear for a patient who wants their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and the form is directly linked from the Patient Forms and Documents > Medical Records page at prevea.com. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was encountered. The URL is descriptive. This is a model for how organizations should make forms accessible.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally-created PDF** — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. A patient must print and hand-fill the form (or annotate it in a PDF viewer). This is the form's most significant technical limitation. The layout is logically organized into nine numbered sections with clear headings, and the single-page format keeps things concise. However, the density required to fit everything onto one page makes the rights section (Section 8) extremely cramped and difficult to read.

Section 8 is the form's weakest content area: a ~200-word paragraph of dense legalese with complex nested clauses that would challenge most patients. The rest of the form uses reasonably plain language with clearly labeled fields and checkbox options.

The form provides granular record-type selection (12 categories plus a free-text field) and includes opt-out checkboxes for sensitive information (alcohol/drug abuse, HIV results, mental health) consistent with Wisconsin law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Barriers

- **No notarization required.** Witness signature is needed only for AODA/Mental Health disclosures, consistent with legal requirements.
- **Fees:** The form states "copy fees may apply" but does not disclose specific amounts — neutral but not fully transparent.
- **Date range default:** If left blank, only records from the past two years are disclosed. This restrictive default is a notable red flag — patients seeking complete records must affirmatively specify a date range, which is unintuitive.
- **Submission instructions absent:** The form provides no guidance on where or how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, mailing address, or email for the HIM department. A patient who downloads and completes the form has no clear next step.
- **Minor errors:** "42 CRF" (should be CFR) and "e-email" (doubled prefix) suggest limited quality review.
- **HSHS references:** The form references "HSHS" (Hospital Sisters Health System) without explanation, which may confuse patients who know only Prevea Health.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — rare among physician practices and reflective of local demographics.
- **Five delivery options** including electronic format and email with encrypted/unencrypted distinction — well above average.
- **Explicit self-request pathway** via the "Self" checkbox and "Patient Request" purpose option.

## Overall Assessment

Prevea Health provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience with genuine accessibility strengths (multilingual forms, electronic delivery options, easy findability). The primary weaknesses are the non-fillable PDF format, missing submission instructions, a restrictive date range default, and dense legalese in the rights section. The form serves patients adequately but falls short of best-in-class due to its paper-oriented workflow and the absence of submission guidance.

# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Providence St. Vincent Medical Center does not publish facility-specific ROI forms. All record request forms are managed at the parent system level by Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), a major nonprofit health system spanning seven states. Three overlapping forms were found on the Providence HIM page:

1. **Form-1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" (ORC 240A, rev. 03/20): A general-purpose ROI authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Includes a "Self" checkbox but is framed around disclosure to others.
2. **Form-2** — "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" (940507, dated 3/27/25): A dedicated patient access form with updated PSJH branding and R1RCM vendor contact info. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
3. **Form-3** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" (rev. 03/20): An older OR/MT-specific patient access form that form-2 appears to supersede, with outdated PH&S branding and contact information.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence meaningfully distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Form-2 is explicitly titled as a "Patient Request to Access" and defaults to disclosure "to Myself" as the first option. This is a genuine dedicated patient access form — not a generic authorization repurposed with a self-access checkbox. However, the general authorization (form-1) is more easily found via web search, meaning a patient may encounter the less appropriate form first. The HIM page does not clearly guide patients toward form-2 over form-1.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required pivoting from the facility name to the parent system. A search for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center" did not surface ROI forms directly — searchers had to navigate to the system-level HIM page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management`. Once found, this page is comprehensive, listing multiple forms with instructions. However, the presence of three overlapping forms with no clear guidance on which is current creates confusion. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2, the primary patient access form, is a well-constructed digital document. At 3 pages and 72 fillable fields, it is genuinely interactive — patients can complete nearly every field digitally before printing for signature. The layout uses clearly labeled sections (patient information, use and disclosure, record type selection, rights statement, signature) with capitalized headers. Record type options are helpfully tiered: "Pertinent information" (with an explanatory list of common record types) versus "All/Entire Medical Record," plus an "Other" field and "Last two years only" option.

The language is mostly clear, though the title uses the HIPAA term "Designated Record Set" rather than plain-language alternatives. The opening warning — "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — is somewhat intimidating without clarifying which fields are required versus optional.

Five delivery options are offered: MyChart, Paper (Mailed), CD (Mailed), FAX, and Email. Including MyChart is a notable patient-friendly touch. Submission can be made by mail, email (ROIHIMreception@r1rcm.com), or fax — no in-person visit is required.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable barrier is the wet-signature requirement on forms 1 and 3, though form-2 may accept electronic signatures (it lacks the explicit "Print form and sign by hand" instruction found on the others). Fees are disclosed vaguely — "there may be a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access.

A potential red flag appears in form-2's internal "HOSPITAL USE ONLY" section, which includes a physician approval/denial workflow for record release. Under HIPAA § 164.524, denial of patient access is permitted only in narrow circumstances; a blanket physician-approval gate could constitute an unreasonable barrier if applied broadly.

The continued publication of the outdated form-3 alongside form-2, with different contact information and organizational branding, risks sending patients to non-functional channels.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from general third-party authorization
- **72 fillable interactive fields** on the primary form — genuinely digital-first design
- **Five delivery format options** including MyChart and email
- **Multilingual language assistance notices** in English, Spanish, and Chinese
- **Multiple submission channels** (mail, email, fax) with no in-person requirement
- **Comprehensive HIM page** with centralized ROI processing

## Overall Assessment

Providence St. Vincent, through its parent system, provides an above-average patient record request experience. The existence of a dedicated patient access form with strong digital fillability and multiple delivery options demonstrates genuine attention to patient needs. The main weaknesses are findability (requiring navigation from facility to system-level resources), form proliferation without clear versioning guidance, vague fee disclosures, and the physician-approval gate embedded in form-2's workflow. A patient who finds form-2 will have a good experience; the challenge is ensuring they find it.

# UPMC Presbyterian — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

UPMC Presbyterian uses the system-wide UPMC "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (form-1.pdf), a two-page PDF hosted on UPMC's Digital Asset Management CDN. Two additional documents were found: an In-Home Urgent Care variant (form-2.pdf) for home-based care services, and an informational guide (form-3.pdf) that walks patients through completing the main form. The primary form relevant to a patient at UPMC Presbyterian requesting their own hospital records is form-1.pdf.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UPMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to physicians, insurers, attorneys, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form used for third-party release, selecting "Personal Use" as the purpose and listing themselves as the recipient. However, UPMC does include a notable inline annotation: **"Purpose is not required for patient access,"** a clear acknowledgment of HIPAA individual access rights that most organizations omit. This partially bridges the gap, but the form's structure — "I authorize UPMC to release information to: [Facility/Person to Receive Records]" — remains fundamentally oriented toward release to third parties. There is no separate patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a MyChart-based records request workflow in the materials reviewed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links on UPMC's CDN. The form is prominently linked from both the system-wide medical records page and the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page. No bot blocking, broken links, or login requirements were encountered. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a **born-digital but print-first PDF**. Despite being created digitally (22 embedded fonts, not a scan), it has essentially no fillable fields — only 1 unnamed interactive field was detected across the entire document. All data entry points use underscore-style blank lines and checkbox squares intended for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit it via mail or fax.

The form is **extremely dense**. Page 1 packs facility selection (14+ UPMC hospitals), patient demographics, recipient information, purpose, disclosure format, delivery method, record type selection (20+ specific document types), sensitive-information opt-outs, expiration terms, and signature blocks onto a single page. While the logical flow is sound (sections labeled A through C), the tight spacing and small text create a visually overwhelming experience. Page 2 contains patient rights and responsibilities disclosures.

The language mixes plain English with legal terminology. Instructions like "Parts 1 and 2 below must be completed" are clear, but fee language and re-disclosure warnings are dense. The 20+ record-type checkboxes offer impressive granularity but may overwhelm patients who simply want "all my records."

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Fee language is ambiguous for patient access.** The form states "charges may be associated with this request" citing Pennsylvania state law, without distinguishing patient access (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) from third-party requests. The phrase "records will be sent upon receipt of payment" could be read as conditioning access on pre-payment.
- **90-day default authorization expiration** is unusually short and may force resubmission if processing is slow, though patients can specify up to one year.
- **No fillable fields** despite born-digital creation is a missed opportunity that forces a paper workflow.
- **Fax delivery restricted to "Providers Only"** — patients cannot receive records by fax, though email and Direct Address are available as electronic delivery alternatives.

## Notable Strengths

- **Companion instruction guide** (form-3.pdf) is a rare patient-friendly resource that explains each section with plain-language examples (e.g., "Inpatient: Admitted for treatment or surgery with overnight stay in hospital").
- **"Purpose is not required for patient access"** — an unusually clear inline acknowledgment of HIPAA rights.
- **Email and Direct Address delivery options** demonstrate awareness of digital access preferences.
- **Anti-conditioning statement** explicitly states UPMC will not condition treatment on signing.
- **Oral authorization provision** for patients physically unable to sign, with two-witness requirements.

## Overall Assessment

UPMC Presbyterian provides an accessible, findable ROI form with some genuinely patient-friendly features — particularly the companion guide and the "purpose not required" note. However, the organization funnels all record requests through a single generic authorization form that was designed for third-party release, lacks interactive form fields despite being born-digital, and uses ambiguous fee language that doesn't clearly distinguish patient access rights. The result is a process that a motivated patient can navigate but that was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. For a major academic health system, the lack of any digital-first submission pathway (online portal, fillable PDF, or web form) is a notable gap.

# TriStar Centennial Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

TriStar Centennial Medical Center is an HCA Healthcare–affiliated community hospital in Nashville, TN. Three documents were retrieved: the primary English-language HCA authorization form (form-1), a Spanish translation (form-3), and a separate form for Centennial Medical Group, an affiliated physician practice in Elkridge, MD (form-2). The hospital's own forms (form-1 and form-3) are the relevant documents for assessing this facility's patient access experience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for authorization/release form terms immediately surfaced the hospital's medical records page, which is clearly organized under For Patients → Medical Records. Both English and Spanish PDF download links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or portal login was required. The HCA Digital Asset Management URLs worked with a standard download. This is about as easy as form retrieval gets.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

TriStar Centennial does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary document (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of PHI" designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release. The "Purpose of disclosure" field lists "At the request of the individual" as the first option, with "Other 3rd party recipient" as the alternative — but both flow through the same form, same fields, and same process. Patients must navigate Section B (marketing/sale of PHI disclosures) even when it doesn't apply, and the form's recipient fields are oriented toward third-party recipients rather than a simple "send me my records" workflow.

That said, the medical records page also offers a **Swellbox online portal** for digital submission and the **MyHealthONE patient portal** for direct record access, providing alternative pathways that may offer a more patient-centric experience. The existence of these portal options partially compensates for the generic form design.

## Form Document Quality

The primary HCA form (form-1) is technically excellent. It is a **digitally native, single-page PDF with 52 fillable fields** — covering every input from patient demographics to 16+ record-type checkboxes to delivery preferences. This is unusually thorough; many organizations provide flat, non-fillable PDFs that require printing and handwriting. The file is lean (170 KB, no embedded images, 9 fonts), confirming it was designed as a digital artifact rather than scanned from paper.

The form offers **four delivery format options** — paper copy, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email — which is above average. It includes a forward-looking **USCDI Release Request** option for structured health data exchange, though this feature is aimed at provider-to-provider use and would confuse most patients.

Layout is organized into three labeled sections (A: core authorization, B: marketing/sale disclosures, C: signatures), which provides logical structure. However, packing this much content into a single page means tight spacing and modest font sizes. The language is a mix of functional form labels and legal disclosures — the patient rights statements use reasonably plain first-person language ("I understand that…"), but passages like the unencrypted email risk disclaimer are dense.

The **Spanish translation** (form-3) is a full parallel version with identical structure and 52 fillable fields — not a scan or afterthought. A few staff-facing elements (footer text, "ID verified by" field) remain in English, but the patient-facing content is fully translated.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no significant barriers**. No notarization or witness is required. The SSN field is explicitly marked optional. The 180-day default expiration is reasonable with options for custom dates. Psychotherapy notes are properly separated per HIPAA requirements. Fee language references a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts — appropriate, though it gives patients no cost visibility.

Submission options include **fax (844-481-0298) and mail**, plus the Swellbox portal for fully digital submission. A patient can complete and submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual fillable PDFs**: Both English and Spanish versions with 52 interactive fields each, directly linked from the same page
- **USCDI release option**: Rare acknowledgment of interoperability standards on an ROI form
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Four options including encrypted email
- **Portal alternatives**: Swellbox and MyHealthONE provide digital-first pathways beyond the PDF
- **10-day turnaround** (on the CMG form) and clear contact information

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: The generic authorization form doesn't distinguish individual access rights from third-party release
- **Default to paper delivery**: If the delivery section is left blank, the patient gets paper — an electronic default would be more patient-friendly
- **Dense single page**: The amount of content compressed onto one page may challenge patients with limited literacy or visual impairments
- **Minor grammatical error**: "I may see and obtain a copy the information" is missing "of"

## Overall Assessment

TriStar Centennial earns a **B grade**. The technical quality of its forms is strong — fillable fields, bilingual availability, multiple delivery options, and a clean digital PDF. Retrieval is effortless. Compliance posture is solid with no unnecessary barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway: a patient requesting their own records navigates the same authorization form as an insurer or attorney, with no differentiation in process, language, or workflow. The availability of portal alternatives (Swellbox, MyHealthONE) partially mitigates this, but the core PDF experience doesn't center the patient as an individual exercising their right of access.

# Black River Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Black River Memorial Hospital (Black River Falls, WI) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital operating under the "Black River Health" brand. The organization offers a single downloadable ROI form for patients requesting health records. There is no patient portal–based request pathway, no online submission wizard, and no dedicated patient access form — only a general-purpose "Release of Information Authorization" that serves all release scenarios.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one ROI-related form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page "Release of Information Authorization" linked from the Patient Resources page. The form covers both directions of information flow — releasing records from the organization and receiving records to it — and is designed primarily for facility-to-facility transfers. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this general-purpose form, selecting "Per Patient Request" as one of eight possible reasons for the release.

No online portal, email submission, or electronic request pathway exists. The form lists delivery format options for *receiving* records (Mailed, Faxed, Pick Up, CD) but provides **no instructions for how to submit the completed form** — no mailing address, fax number, or drop-off location. The only contact information on the form is the HIPAA Privacy & Security Officer phone number (715-284-5361). A patient would need to call to determine how to return the form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. It is linked from the Patient Resources page under a "Forms" section, labeled "Authorization to Disclose Information." A site-specific web search also surfaced the direct PDF URL immediately. The description on the website frames the form as being for sharing information "from other healthcare facilities or providers" — not explicitly for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Black River Memorial Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form funnels all requests through the same authorization workflow. While the form includes "Per Patient Request" as a reason option and page 2 contains a substantive patient rights section (right to receive a copy, refuse to sign, revoke, inspect, and prohibition of conditions), the form's structure assumes a third-party release scenario: Section 2 asks "who has the information" and Section 3 asks "where you want it sent." A patient requesting their own records must work within this framework, which isn't designed for them.

## Form Document Quality

The form has **severe technical accessibility problems**. Despite being created in Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 in 2025, the PDF renders virtually all text as images — 970 embedded images across 2 pages, with only 43 characters of extractable text. The form has zero fillable/interactive fields; patients must print and complete it by hand. This makes the form inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.

On the positive side, the visual layout is well-organized with numbered sections and clear headers using question-like phrasing ("Why the information is needed," "How would you like this information"). The form is a reasonable 2 pages in length. However, Section 2 confusingly mixes source facility checkboxes with information-type checkboxes (Alcohol Treatment, HIV Results), and Section 5 imposes a default 2-year scope if the patient doesn't specify a date range.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. The form mentions a "reasonable fee may be associated" for inspecting or copying records but provides no specifics on amounts or HIPAA fee limitations. No response time commitment is stated. The prohibition of conditions language is explicitly included — the organization cannot condition treatment or benefits on signing the authorization. A photocopy clause ("as valid as the original") is a patient-friendly touch.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Easy findability, explicit prohibition of conditions, photocopy validity clause, patient-friendly expiration (remains in effect until processed), and direct HIPAA Privacy Officer contact information.

**Red flags:** The near-total text inaccessibility of a modern Word-generated PDF is a significant barrier, particularly for patients with disabilities. The complete absence of submission instructions means a patient who downloads the form online has no idea how to return it. The lack of any dedicated patient access pathway means every patient must navigate a form designed for third-party releases.

## Overall Assessment

Black River Memorial Hospital provides an easy-to-find form with reasonable content and good compliance language, but the technical execution is poor and the patient access experience is an afterthought. The image-rendered PDF and missing submission instructions create unnecessary friction for a patient trying to exercise their right of access. **Grade: C.**

# UF Health Shands Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UF Health Shands Hospital, a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Gainesville, Florida, offers patients a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all record requests. Four versions of this form (form family PS46283/RI0001) were found online, but only one — form-2.pdf, revised 5/30/19 — is linked from the official medical records page. No dedicated patient self-access pathway exists; patients requesting their own records use the same authorization form designed for third-party release.

## Forms and Pathways

The primary form (form-2.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF linked from ufhealth.org/medical-records. Three additional variants persist online: form-1.pdf (a 2015 revision with more detailed identity verification and numbered sections), form-3.pdf (a 2014 legacy version with a liability waiver and HealthPort electronic delivery), and form-4.pdf (a clinic-specific variant pre-filled for the Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment). All share the same form code and general structure. The coexistence of multiple undifferentiated versions at different URLs creates a risk that patients or providers encounter outdated forms via search engines.

Submission options are mail and fax, both clearly printed on form-2. The medical records page also lists a phone number. An in-person pick-up option is noted on the form. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway per the scoring baseline.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UF Health Shands does **not** offer a differentiated patient self-access pathway. The form is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — the HIPAA authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than the Right of Access framework (§ 164.524). The sole accommodation for patients requesting their own records is a small "Check here if same as patient" checkbox in the "To" field. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, does not distinguish fee structures for patient access versus third-party release, and does not include any language framing the request as an individual access right.

That said, the form does include "Personal Use" as an explicit purpose option, and the identity verification fields in the representative section are marked "Internal use only," appropriately sparing patients from producing documentation at the time of form completion.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a cleanly designed, born-digital single-page PDF — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally composed (8 fonts, no embedded images, only 95 KB), the form requires printing and handwriting. This is a persistent gap across all four form versions, suggesting an organizational decision rather than a legacy issue.

The layout is logical: patient demographics → from/to routing → facility selection → record types → dates/purpose/format → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. Sixteen record-type checkboxes (including separated sensitive-information categories for behavioral health, substance use disorder, STD/HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing) provide excellent granularity. The legal disclosure section uses reasonably clear language with helpful parentheticals (e.g., "revoke it in writing (i.e., tell UF Health to cancel it)"), though the opening corporate entity definition paragraph is dense legalese.

Delivery format options include MyUFHealth (the patient portal), CD, and paper — the portal option is a notable modern addition, though it serves as a delivery mechanism rather than a request submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization, witness signatures, or in-person submission is required. Authorization expires after one year with clear revocation rights. However, the fee disclosure — "up to $1.00 per page (plus applicable tax and handling) for Paper Records" — is applied uniformly without distinguishing patient access from third-party release. For patient self-access under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4), HIPAA limits fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts; the $1.00/page rate (reflecting Florida's statutory schedule for third-party releases) may exceed this standard. No response time commitment is stated.

The older form-3 includes a liability waiver ("I hereby release and discharge UF Health...from any liability"), which is an additional barrier not present in the current primary form.

## Overall Assessment

UF Health Shands provides an easily findable, well-organized, and compact authorization form, but falls short in two critical areas: (1) the complete absence of fillable PDF fields forces a paper-based workflow, and (2) the generic authorization framework fails to differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The fee language, while standard for Florida third-party releases, is potentially non-compliant when applied to patient access requests. The form earns credit for its granular record-type selection, explicit "Personal Use" purpose option, MyUFHealth portal delivery, and patient-friendly touches like marking verification fields as internal-use-only — but these bright spots don't compensate for the fundamental lack of a patient-centered access pathway and the print-and-handwrite workflow.

# Synthesis: Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix

## Overview

Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix is part of Banner Health, a major nonprofit health system in the western United States. The facility uses Banner Health's system-wide forms for medical records release rather than maintaining its own. Two forms were found: a current system-wide authorization (form-1.pdf, revised 06/2025) and a legacy hospital-specific version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/2017). The current system-wide form is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Banner Health offers two pathways for record access: a downloadable PDF authorization form and a patient portal (Banner Health App / https://account.bannerhealth.com/). The current form (form-1.pdf) prominently notes at the top that patients can access most health information through the portal, which is a helpful redirect before a patient commits to the paper process. For records not available through the portal, the PDF form is the primary pathway. Submission options include mail, fax, and in-person pick-up — fax provides an adequate electronic submission method, though there is no online form submission or email-based submission option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Banner Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" documents designed to cover all release scenarios. The current form includes a "Self" checkbox under both the "Release/Send Information To" field and the "Purpose" field, acknowledging that patients may request their own records, but the form structure, language, and authorization requirements are identical regardless of who the records are going to. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same release-from/release-to paradigm, date range fields, record type checkboxes, and HIPAA authorization language that a third party would face. There is no simplified patient access request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A straightforward web search returned the system-wide form immediately, and it is published on bannerhealth.com under the patients/medical-records section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA was encountered. Both forms were directly downloadable via curl. The coexistence of the current (2025) and legacy (2017) forms on the same website creates a minor risk that patients might download the outdated version, which lacks the portal callout and has less granular sensitive-information controls.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a flat, non-fillable PDF — zero interactive form fields despite being a born-digital document. A patient must print the form, handwrite all fields, sign it, and submit via mail, fax, or in-person. The form is 2 pages with approximately 20 fields to complete (patient demographics, release from/to addresses, date range, record type checkboxes, delivery preference, purpose, and signature). The layout is logically organized with clear section headers and a natural top-to-bottom flow. Record-type selection is granular with 12 specific categories plus an "Other" option.

Language is mixed: the opening paragraph about "third-party directives" is dense regulatory jargon that would confuse most patients, but the authorization statements on page 2 use accessible "I understand" framing. The sensitive information section uses an exclusion model — all sensitive data is included by default, with checkboxes to opt specific categories out. This is more protective than the legacy form's blanket consent but may still surprise patients who don't realize they must affirmatively opt out.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: The form warns "There may be a FEE associated with your Request for Records" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access fees (capped under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. This vagueness may deter patients from making requests.

**Liability waiver**: The form includes a broad release of Banner Health from "any legal responsibility or liability for the disclosure" — a clause that goes beyond standard HIPAA authorization requirements.

**No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature (or legal representative), which is appropriate.

**No in-person requirement**: Fax submission is available, so patients are not forced to visit the facility.

## Strengths

- **Patient portal callout**: The prominent opening line directing patients to the portal is a best practice that may eliminate the need for the paper form entirely for many patients.
- **Recent revision**: The 06/2025 revision date demonstrates active form maintenance.
- **Granular record selection**: 12 specific record categories give patients meaningful control.
- **Sensitive information opt-out**: Per-category exclusion checkboxes improve on the blanket consent approach.
- **Clear patient rights language**: Explicit statements about the right to refuse, non-conditioning of treatment, and right to revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Banner Health provides a findable, recently maintained, and reasonably well-designed authorization form, but it falls short of a truly patient-centered experience. The form funnels all requests — self-access and third-party — through the same generic authorization, the PDF is not fillable, and the fee disclosure is vague. The patient portal redirect is a genuine bright spot, but for patients who need the paper form, the experience is a standard paper-based workflow with no digital-first innovation. The organization earns credit for accessibility and active maintenance but loses ground on technical modernization and pathway differentiation.

# Heartland Community Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Heartland Community Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Lawrence, Kansas, serving patients across three locations. The organization provides a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" — for all records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party release.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page PDF titled "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" (form-1.pdf), hosted in the organization's WordPress uploads directory. This form serves all release purposes — patient access, provider-to-provider transfers, insurance disputes, and referrals. A "Patient's Request" checkbox appears among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Records From" and "Records To" fields) is oriented around third-party transfer rather than individual access. A patient requesting records for personal use would find it unclear how to complete the "Records To" section.

Submission options are reasonable: email (medrecords@heartlandhealth.org), fax (785-856-0375), and mail. A phone line for questions (785-842-4477, Option 5) is also provided. These multiple channels meet the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was not discoverable through generic web searches but was found via a site-scoped search (`site:heartlandhealth.org`). The URL is descriptive and the download was straightforward once located. The form is not prominently linked from obvious patient-facing pages — it lives in a WordPress uploads directory, suggesting it may be embedded on an interior page but is not surfaced in primary navigation or a patient resources section.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally-created, single-page PDF with a full text layer — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it functions as a print-and-handwrite document. The layout is logically ordered (demographics → record types → delivery method → from/to → purpose → legal disclosures → signature → return instructions) and fits everything onto a single page, though the density is high with 16 fonts and tight spacing.

The form uses approximately 20+ data entry points (name, DOB, address, phones, date ranges, multiple checkbox groups, records from/to blocks, signature lines). The opening line — "To treat you effectively, your provider needs to review your past medical records" — is patient-friendly, though it subtly frames the form around incoming records transfer rather than patient-initiated access.

One notable design feature is the pre-bundled "Record Set" option, which offers a thoughtfully curated default bundle (last 3 visit notes, recent labs, medication list, immunization records, screening reports, and specialist list). This reduces decision burden for patients who want comprehensive records.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Witness requirement**: A "Witness" signature line is present but never explicitly stated as required. Its inclusion may deter patients or create confusion about whether a witness is actually needed.

**Mental health records**: These require a completely separate form and cannot be combined with other record types on the same submission, creating an additional barrier for patients seeking comprehensive records.

**Email liability disclaimers**: Two separate liability waivers for email delivery appear on the form, which may discourage patients from choosing this convenient option.

**Fees**: No fees are mentioned anywhere on the form — neither disclosed nor waived.

**Compliance language**: The form properly addresses revocation rights, 12-month expiration, treatment non-conditioning, and re-disclosure warnings. However, it does not reference the patient's Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Overall Assessment

Heartland Community Health Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The form is accessible online (with some searching), offers multiple submission channels, and includes some patient-friendly elements like the pre-bundled record set and plain-language opening. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party release framing, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of any dedicated patient access pathway all work against patient-centeredness. The form is adequate for its purpose but was not designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. For an FQHC serving a population that may face literacy or technology barriers, the non-fillable format and dense layout represent meaningful obstacles.

# Texas Oncology — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Texas Oncology provides a single ROI form — an "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf). Both are 3-page fillable PDFs, structurally identical, revised 09/19/2024. They are available as direct downloads from a dedicated Medical Records page at texasoncology.com/medical-records. The page outlines a clear 3-step process: download the form, complete it, and submit by fax or mail.

No patient portal submission, online request wizard, or third-party vendor platform (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was found. The only request pathway is the downloadable PDF form submitted by fax or mail.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Texas Oncology does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party disclosure. The single form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering nine disclosure reasons — Treatment, Personal Use, Billing, Legal Purposes, Disability Determination, School, Employment, Health Oversight, and Other. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" and then navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios, including filling in both "I authorize the following to disclose" (naming Texas Oncology) and "Who can receive and use the health information?" (naming themselves). This is awkward when the requester and recipient are the same person.

Notably, page 2 of the form includes a legally accurate statement that "This form is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual," citing 45 CFR §§ 164.502(a)(1)(i) and 164.524. However, this critical information is buried in supplementary legal text — not surfaced on page 1 where a patient would see it before completing the 3-page form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible from footer navigation (approximately one click from the homepage). While older PDF URLs found via web search returned 404 errors due to a site migration to Sitecore Edge CDN, the live page links worked without issue. No bot blocking, login walls, or captchas were encountered. Overall retrieval difficulty: easy to moderate — the slight complication was dead legacy URLs, but the current page is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed fillable PDF with 95 interactive fields — a thoroughly digitized form designed for on-screen completion. The layout is clean and logical: patient demographics → reason for disclosure → authorizing party → recipient → delivery method → record types → time period → signature. Section headers in all caps provide clear visual hierarchy.

The form offers 16 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, radiology reports, pathology, etc.) plus "All Health Information" and "Other," giving patients meaningful granularity. Four sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, genetic information, HIV/AIDS) require separate initialing, consistent with HIPAA and Texas law.

The language is reasonably plain for a legal authorization form. The statement that treatment cannot be denied for refusing to sign is prominently placed at the top of page 1 — better positioning than many ROI forms. However, the fee language on page 2 contains a grammatical error ("There may charge a retrieval/processing fee") and fails to specify amounts or distinguish patient-access fees from third-party disclosure fees.

The 95 fillable fields lack semantic names in the PDF metadata (all field names are empty), which impairs accessibility for screen readers and assistive technology.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Barriers are low to moderate.** No notarization is required — only a patient signature. No in-person submission is required; fax and mail are both accepted. The authorization expiration is reasonable (valid until death, revocation, or optional specified date). Right to revoke is clearly stated. The form includes current reproductive health protections (45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)) with a dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page — demonstrating up-to-date compliance with 2024 federal rules.

The main barrier is the lack of electronic submission: despite the fillable PDF and email as a records *delivery* option, patients must still print, sign, and fax or mail the form. There is no e-signature, portal upload, or online submission pathway.

Fee disclosure is vague — "a retrieval/processing fee may be charged" without specifics. No response time commitment is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: A professionally translated Spanish version is offered as a parallel download — commendable for a Texas-based practice serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **Reproductive health protections**: The dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page is current with 2024 federal law.
- **Email delivery option**: Records can be delivered via email, providing a practical electronic access mechanism.
- **Treatment-not-conditioned**: Prominently positioned at the top of page 1.

## Overall Assessment

Texas Oncology provides a competent but generic records request experience. The form is well-built as a document — fillable, logically organized, bilingual, and legally current. However, it funnels patients through a third-party authorization process rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. The buried acknowledgment that the form "is not required" for patient self-access only underscores this mismatch. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience. The organization earns a **B** grade — solid document quality and accessibility, held back by the lack of a patient-centered access pathway.
