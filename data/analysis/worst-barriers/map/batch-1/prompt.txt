You are analyzing ROI form retrieval results for a study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city). Use this to contextualize your findings by org type.

Your task: identify the most significant barriers patients would face when trying to
request their records from organizations in this batch. Look for:
- Difficulty finding the form
- Burdensome requirements imposed on patients
- Poor technical accessibility
- Anything that would frustrate or discourage a patient

Write your findings to "output.md". For each barrier:
- Name the organization and describe the problem
- Explain the impact on patients
- Note whether this seems like an oversight or a pattern

End with a brief summary of barrier patterns across this batch.
Keep to 500-1000 words.

# Maury Regional Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Maury Regional Health, a nonprofit regional system based in Columbia, TN (encompassing Maury Regional Medical Center, Marshall Medical Center, Wayne Medical Center, and Maury Regional Medical Group), provides a reasonably accessible records request experience with several notable strengths — particularly multilingual availability and multiple delivery channels — but falls short of best-in-class by relying on a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms were found, both linked from the Medical Records page (`/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/`):

- **Form 1 (Form 131, 08/2018):** English-language "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a single-page, general-purpose ROI form.
- **Form 2 (Form 131S, 05/2017):** Spanish-language translation of the same form, though dated over a year earlier and containing content discrepancies.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, the medical records page also offers an **online request portal via Swellbox** and access through the **My Maury Health Patient Portal**, giving patients three distinct channels. Fax submission (931.380.4092) and phone contact (931.380.4089) are also listed.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Maury Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form serves all purposes — requesting your own records, releasing to an attorney, sending to an insurer, etc. However, the form does accommodate patient access by listing "Myself" as the first option in the recipient field and including "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox. A patient can use this form, but must navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios (specifying a recipient name/address, selecting among purposes that don't apply). The availability of the Swellbox online portal is a meaningful alternative that may provide a more streamlined patient experience, though the portal itself was not evaluated in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A site-scoped search immediately surfaced the medical records page. The page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Medical Records). PDFs are hosted on Cloudinary CDN and downloaded without authentication or bot blocking. The only minor difficulty was a 403 error from the web_fetch tool on the medical records page, requiring browser fallback — but the PDFs themselves downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (Form 131) is a clean, single-page, digitally-created PDF — not a scan. It has a proper text layer enabling screen reader access and text search. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring handwriting after printing. The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (demographics → direction of release → purpose → date range → record types → format → consent → signature) and uses reasonable visual hierarchy with checkboxes and section groupings. Language is a blend of plain English and necessary legal terminology — the consent bullets are clearly written, though the sensitive information disclosure section is dense.

The form offers an unusually good set of **four delivery format options**: paper copies, CD, USB flash drive, and encrypted email — with a thoughtful security disclosure about email risks.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required.**
- **No fees disclosed** — the form says nothing about costs.
- **Hold harmless clause** is a red flag: "The facility is hereby released and discharged of any liability, and I will hold the facility harmless for complying with this authorization." HIPAA does not permit conditioning access on signing a liability release.
- **90-day authorization expiration** is relatively short but within norms.
- **Photo ID verification** on the English form implies in-person submission, though the website lists fax as an option.
- **No response time commitment** stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — uncommon among community hospitals in this study.
- **Multiple request channels** (PDF, Swellbox portal, patient portal, fax, phone).
- **Encrypted email delivery** option with proactive security disclosure.
- **"Myself" listed first** in the recipient field — a subtle but meaningful patient-centric design choice.

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must use a generic authorization form.
- **Non-fillable PDF** — requires printing and handwriting.
- **Spanish form is outdated** (05/2017 vs. 08/2018 English) with missing content (no Social Security/Disability purpose, no Photo ID section).
- **Hold harmless clause** is potentially noncompliant for patient access requests.
- **Sensitive information limitation** is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to exercise it.

## Overall Assessment

Maury Regional Health provides an accessible, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process with commendable multilingual support and multiple submission channels. The main shortcomings are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, a non-fillable PDF form, and a potentially problematic liability waiver. The availability of the Swellbox online portal partially compensates for the PDF's limitations, and the overall experience is adequate — a patient can successfully request their own records without undue difficulty, though the process could be more patient-centric.

# Erlanger Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga, TN provides three distinct ROI-related documents: a general system-wide "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form-1), a behavioral health–specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" (form-3). The existence of form-3 — a purpose-built patient access request form — is the key differentiator for this organization and the focus of this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Erlanger is one of the organizations that clearly distinguishes between a patient exercising their right of access and a third-party release authorization. Form-3 is titled "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" and opens with the option to "give me a copy of my health information" — framing the interaction as a patient right rather than an authorization for disclosure. This is structurally separate from form-1, which serves as the general-purpose ROI authorization covering any release direction (to self, third party, insurer, attorney, etc.). The existence of this dedicated pathway shows deliberate organizational awareness that patient access and third-party release are different use cases with different legal frameworks.

However, the dedicated form originates from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital (EWCH) and it is unclear from the form itself whether it applies system-wide. The general ROI form (form-1) does include a "_________myself" option in the "Release Information To" field, providing an alternate pathway through the broader form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. All three were surfaced through a single web search, with no login walls, bot blocking, or broken links. The main erlanger.org site hosts a Medical Records page under patient tools. Form-3's URL is under a "murphy" path that may be associated with a specific facility building, making it less discoverable via direct site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the primary patient access form, is a single-page, digitally authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The layout is clean and logical, flowing from patient identification through facility selection, date range, record type checkboxes, format preference, delivery method, and signature. The language is notably plain and patient-friendly, using first-person phrasing: "I would like," "I want these parts of my record." The form provides granular record selection with 18 options across hospital and office/clinic categories, giving patients meaningful control over scope.

Form-1 (the general ROI) is also digitally authored with a text layer but no fillable fields (2 pages, 14+ record type options). Form-2 (behavioral health) is an image-only scan — inaccessible to screen readers and impossible to fill electronically.

## Submission Methods

Form-3 does not clearly state how to submit the completed form. An "EWCH Use Only" section with "ID Verified" checkboxes implies in-person submission may be expected. However, the broader Erlanger system accepts fax submissions — form-2's instruction page provides a fax number for the HIM department, and form-1 includes fax as a contact/delivery option. Mail is also available. No online portal or email submission option exists for the forms themselves, though secure email is offered as a records *delivery* method.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness requirements exist. The primary patient access form (form-3) is completely silent on fees — patients have no idea if they will be charged. Form-1 mentions "charges may apply" for CD and paper copies but does not specify amounts. Form-3 notes a 30-day turnaround, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Both form-1 and form-3 request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary when combined with name, DOB, and medical record number. Form-1 bundles sensitive-category consent (substance abuse, HIV, mental health) with no opt-out mechanism, which may raise 42 CFR Part 2 concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release — a meaningful structural choice
- **Plain-language, first-person framing** that is unusually patient-friendly
- **Granular record type selection** (18 options across hospital and clinic settings)
- **Secure email as a delivery option** for receiving records
- **Single-page simplicity** for the patient access form

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any form — all require print-and-handwrite workflow
- **No fee disclosure** on the patient access form
- **Unclear submission process** for form-3 (implies in-person with ID verification)
- **No patient rights statement** on the dedicated access form
- **Behavioral health form (form-2)** is an image-only scan with production errors (placeholder text left in)

## Overall Assessment

Erlanger demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form with plain language and granular record selection. The organizational awareness that patient access differs from third-party release is commendable. However, the complete absence of fillable fields, unclear submission instructions, and lack of fee transparency prevent the experience from being truly streamlined. The overall pathway earns a **B** — solid design intent held back by technical and process execution gaps.

# Michigan Medicine – University of Michigan Health: Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Michigan Medicine provides three publicly available forms related to medical records, though only one is relevant for patient self-access. **Form-1** (70-10015, VER: A/24) is the current "Authorization to Release Copies of a Medical Record," a 3-page document that serves as the primary ROI form for both patient self-requests and third-party releases. **Form-2** is an outdated 2011 version of the same form, still indexed on the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain — a housekeeping gap that could confuse patients. **Form-3** is an inbound records request form (authorizing Michigan Medicine to pull records from other providers), unrelated to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves dual purposes, but it does meaningfully differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Item 2 provides a dedicated "Myself" checkbox with delivery options tailored to patients (Patient Portal, electronic email web link, US Mail), while item 3 handles third-party recipients with its own delivery methods. This structural separation gives patients a clear path without needing to decode which sections apply to them. Additionally, the form prominently promotes the **MyUofMHealth Patient Portal** as a free, zero-cost delivery channel — a strong nudge toward the most convenient option. However, the form remains fundamentally an authorization rather than a dedicated patient access request, and the fee schedule and prepayment language do not clearly exempt patient self-requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search for Michigan Medicine's ROI form immediately returned direct links to the current PDF on `uofmhealth.org`. No site navigation was required. The download was unobstructed — no CAPTCHAs or bot blocking on the primary domain (though the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain had Cloudflare challenges). The one annoyance is the uninformative filename (`ROI_.pdf`).

## Form Document Quality

The form has a proper text layer and clean digital design — it is not a scan. However, despite the full text layer, **no fillable/interactive PDF fields exist** (metadata confirms `fillable_field_count: 0`). A patient must print and handwrite or use a PDF annotation tool. For submission, fax (734-936-8571) and mail are available; notably, **no walk-in services** are offered — a departure from the 2011 version which accepted in-person delivery at any registration desk.

The layout uses numbered sections (1–9) that follow a logical progression: voluntariness statement → patient info → self/third-party selection → purpose → record set → expiration → revocation → signature → fees. The **package-based record selection** system is a genuine bright spot: instead of requiring patients to specify individual record types, it offers pre-built packages (Package 1: Key Clinical Documentation; Package 2: All Clinical Documentation) mapped to common purposes. This simplifies what is typically one of the most confusing parts of any ROI form.

Language is bureaucratic but generally comprehensible. Legal disclosures (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure risks) are clearly stated. Some passages are dense, particularly the insurance authorization exception clause. The fee schedule on page 3 is presented as a clear table with a helpful "No Cost Services" sidebar.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are disclosed transparently: portal access is free, electronic delivery to patients costs $6.89, and third-party requests incur higher per-page fees. The $6.89 patient fee is close to HIPAA's cost-based guidance but not explicitly justified as cost-based. More concerning is the prepayment language — "Some records requested for legal, insurance, or personal use may require a prepayment" — where "personal use" could be read to include patient self-requests, potentially conflicting with HIPAA's prohibition on conditioning access on payment.

The authorization defaults to a 60-day expiration, which is relatively short given the stated turnaround of 5–7 business days (with a caveat to "allow up to 30 days"). Turnaround time discrepancies between pages 2 and 3 add confusion. The form also names **Vital Chart (VRC)** as the third-party vendor handling records fulfillment — a transparency bright spot that sets patient expectations for communications from an unfamiliar sender.

## Overall Assessment

Michigan Medicine provides a competent, moderately patient-centered records request process. The form is well-organized, the package system simplifies record selection, and the portal promotion guides patients toward a free pathway. However, the lack of fillable PDF fields, the ambiguous prepayment language, and the elimination of walk-in services create friction. The continued availability of the outdated 2011 form is a minor but avoidable risk. This is a solid B-level experience: functional and accessible, with room for improvement in digital form design and compliance clarity.

# Synthesis: Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin

## Overview

Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (GHC-SCW) is a nonprofit, independent physician practice in Madison, WI. It publishes two distinct ROI-related PDF forms, plus a Spanish-language version of one of them, on a well-organized public forms page. Critically, GHC-SCW is one of the relatively rare organizations that offers a **dedicated patient self-access form** separate from its general third-party authorization — a meaningful structural distinction that demonstrates thoughtful process design around patient rights.

## Forms and Pathways

**Form 1** ("Authorization to Release Protected Health Information From GHC-SCW") is a 2-page general HIPAA authorization form oriented toward third-party release. It covers scenarios like transferring care, insurance, disability determinations, and legal use, with "Personal Use" available as one checkbox option. A Spanish version is also published. While usable for patient self-access, the framing, language, and workflow are designed around the third-party release use case.

**Form 2** ("Patient Request for Health Information Form") is a 1-page, fillable PDF designed specifically for patients requesting their own records. This is the primary form for patient self-access and the basis for scoring. It uses plain-English question-based section headers ("What records do you want?", "How would you like your records delivered?"), offers granular record-type checkboxes with date range scoping, and provides multiple delivery options including paper, email (encrypted by default), CD, USB, and MyChart portal delivery.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

GHC-SCW clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release by maintaining two separate forms. Form 2 is purpose-built for the individual access use case, with simpler language, fewer fields, and a patient-centered workflow. This is a best practice that most organizations do not follow — the typical approach is a single generic authorization form that patients must navigate regardless of whether they're requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. The first web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's forms page at ghcscw.com/members/forms/ is cleanly organized with a "Release of Information Forms" section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA were encountered. One minor quirk: Form 2 was listed under "Health Insurance Forms" rather than "Release of Information Forms," which could cause a patient browsing specifically for ROI forms to miss the more patient-friendly option.

## Form Document Quality

Form 2 is technically excellent: a fully fillable PDF with 49 interactive fields on a single page. The layout is clean and logically ordered (demographics → record selection → delivery method → recipient → signature). The language is accessible and avoids legalese. The form explicitly references the patient's HIPAA right of access and sets a transparent processing timeline of 5 business days.

Form 1, by contrast, has zero fillable fields despite being digitally authored, and explicitly prohibits electronic signatures — creating a print-sign-scan workflow that undermines electronic submission. However, since Form 2 is the primary patient access pathway and is fully fillable, the organization's overall technical accessibility is strong.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: Form 2 states "There may be charges associated with processing a request" without specifying amounts. The notes mention CIOX Health as the ROI vendor and note that "CIOX requires payment for medical records." Fee vagueness leaves patients unable to anticipate costs, and the CIOX involvement raises questions about whether fees are limited to HIPAA's cost-based standard for patient access.

**Submission instructions gap**: Form 2 lacks any indication of where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email. Patients must refer to Form 1 or the website for submission details. Form 1 provides mail, fax (608-441-3499), email (ghcroi@ghcscw.com), and in-person drop-off as options.

**No notarization or witness required**. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a genuine best practice
- **Fully fillable PDF** with 49 interactive fields on one concise page
- **Multiple delivery formats**: paper, encrypted email, CD, USB, MyChart portal
- **Encrypted email as default** with opt-in for unencrypted — privacy by design
- **Spanish-language version** of Form 1 available
- **Plain-language, question-based headers** make the form approachable
- **Transparent processing timeline** (5 business days)

## Overall Assessment

GHC-SCW demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by maintaining a dedicated, well-designed patient access form that is technically fillable, concisely written, and offers flexible delivery options including portal-based delivery. The main weaknesses are the vague fee disclosure, the absence of submission instructions on Form 2 itself, and the use of CIOX Health as the ROI vendor (which may introduce fee concerns). Despite these gaps, the organization's approach to patient record access is meaningfully above average and reflects intentional design around patient rights.

# Colquitt Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Colquitt Regional Medical Center (Moultrie, GA) is an independent, government-owned community hospital. The organization offers a single downloadable PDF form for medical records requests, found on its Health Records & Patient Portal page. No online portal, patient portal integration, or alternative digital pathway was identified for requesting records.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was retrieved: an "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for releasing records to third parties. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a patient portal–based records request workflow. The sole pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — though the form itself provides no submission instructions (no fax number, mailing address, or email).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as an authorization for disclosure to a named recipient (item 5 asks for recipient "Name" and "Address"). While item 6 includes a "my personal records" purpose checkbox — a helpful nod toward self-access — the form does not explain what a patient should enter as the recipient when requesting their own records. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of patient access rights, and no separate pathway or instructions for patients who simply want their own medical records. A patient must navigate a form designed for third-party release and adapt it to their self-access needs.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped search quickly identified the Health Records & Patient Portal page, and the form was linked with a clearly labeled "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button — approximately two clicks from the homepage. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy**, and no bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page scanned image** with no meaningful text layer (only 11 characters of noise extracted) and zero fillable fields. It was created in 2021 using scanning software ("Transform Foundation Server"), confirming it is a digitized paper form rather than a digitally authored document. The form is completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology, cannot be filled digitally, and must be printed and completed by hand.

Despite the poor technical quality, the content design is adequate. The 10-item numbered list provides a logical flow: patient identification → who may disclose → record types → sensitive information acknowledgment → recipient → purpose → legal terms → signatures. Twelve record-type checkboxes offer useful granularity. The language mixes plain English with some legal phrasing — mostly readable but occasionally dense (e.g., the revocation paragraph). There are no section headers, boxes, or visual groupings to aid navigation, but the single-page length keeps complexity manageable.

## Barriers

- **No submission instructions**: The form contains no fax number, mailing address, email, or department name. A patient downloading the form has no guidance on how to return it. The website's Health Records page may provide this information, but it is absent from the form itself.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" line is present, which may lead patients to believe a witness is required — HIPAA does not require this for patient access requests.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form makes no mention of fees or costs for records.
- **No date range field**: Patients cannot specify a time period for the records they want.
- **No delivery format options**: No choices for electronic vs. paper delivery.

## Bright Spots

- **Easy findability**: The form was prominently linked from a clearly labeled page.
- **Voluntariness statement**: Item 10 explicitly states that signing is voluntary and will not affect treatment.
- **Patient-controlled expiration**: Item 8 lets the patient set their own authorization expiration date.
- **"My personal records" purpose checkbox**: While the form is generic, this option at least acknowledges that patients may be requesting their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Colquitt Regional Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request pathway. The form is easy to find, but it is a scanned image that cannot be filled digitally, lacks submission instructions, and does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The technical quality is poor — an image-only scan with no fillable fields and no accessibility support. A patient attempting to request their own records faces a form not designed for their use case, must print and handwrite their responses, and receives no guidance on how to submit the completed form. The organization earns credit for findability and a few patient-friendly touches (voluntariness statement, patient-controlled expiration), but the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# JPS Health Network — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

JPS Health Network (John Peter Smith Hospital) is a government-owned community hospital in Fort Worth, TX. The organization's Patient Records page offers three downloadable forms: a primary ROI authorization form (English, with a Spanish version also available), an HIE opt-in authorization, and an HIE revocation form. Only the ROI form (form-1) is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records.

## Forms & Pathways

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is a single-page **Authorization & Request for Release of Information** PDF (form-1.pdf), last revised October 2018. This is a generic ROI form — it does not differentiate between patient self-access requests under HIPAA § 164.524 and third-party release authorizations. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no patient portal pathway mentioned on the records page.

The two HIE-related forms (form-2 and form-3) are irrelevant to patient self-access — they govern provider-to-provider data sharing via a health information exchange.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The Patient Records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records), and web searches also surface the direct PDF URL. The page uses accordion sections to organize content, with the ROI form under "JPS Authorization Form." Fee information and submission instructions are disclosed on the page before download — a transparency positive.

## Form Document Quality

The ROI form is the weakest element of JPS's patient access process. It is an **image-only scan** — a photograph of a paper form with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no extractable text (literally 1 character of output from text extraction). At 478 KB for a single page, it is technically a picture, not a document. It cannot be completed digitally, is invisible to screen readers, and fails basic digital accessibility standards.

The irony is sharp: JPS's 2025 HIE forms demonstrate the organization can produce modern, fillable, text-searchable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The core ROI form — the one patients actually need — remains a 2018 scan that has not been updated in over seven years.

The form is one page, which is an appropriate length. However, because it is an image-only scan, detailed analysis of layout, language clarity, field count, and instructions is limited to visual inspection rather than text analysis.

## Access Pathway Assessment

JPS does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The single ROI form appears to serve all release purposes. The fee schedule on the web page does not distinguish between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees (which Texas state law governs at higher rates). This conflation is a significant patient-centeredness gap.

Submission is limited to **print, handwrite, and mail or fax**. The Patient Records page explicitly states: "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time." Fax is available (which counts as an adequate electronic pathway and avoids the worst penalties), but the form itself cannot be filled digitally — it must be printed and handwritten.

## Barriers

- **Potentially excessive fees**: $30 for the first 10 pages, per-page charges thereafter, and a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery. The $75 electronic delivery fee likely exceeds HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based" standard for patient access requests. The fee schedule does not distinguish patient access from third-party requests.
- **No electronic form submission**: Despite having the technical capability (demonstrated by HIE forms accepting encrypted email), JPS refuses electronic submission of the ROI form.
- **Government photo ID required at pickup**: Standard practice but limits delivery to in-person collection.
- **Stale form**: Over 7 years old, predating HHS Right of Access enforcement actions and 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish language version** available for the ROI form, appropriate for Fort Worth demographics.
- **Fee disclosure** is transparent — patients know costs before downloading the form.
- **Easy findability** — the form is prominent and well-organized on the website.
- **HIE forms show capability** — the 2025 HIE forms prove JPS can do better, which makes the outdated ROI form a choice rather than a limitation.

## Overall Assessment

JPS Health Network presents a frustrating contradiction. The organization clearly has the technical capability and institutional will to produce modern, accessible digital forms — the 2025 HIE forms are well-designed, fillable, and accept encrypted email submission. Yet the core ROI form that patients actually need to request their own records remains a seven-year-old image scan with no digital functionality. Combined with potentially excessive fees and no electronic submission, the patient experience is well below what this organization could deliver. The form is easy to find, and fax submission is available, but the document itself is a relic that creates unnecessary barriers for patients exercising their access rights.

# Synthesis: Aurora Medical Center - Grafton

## Overview

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton is a community hospital in Grafton, Wisconsin, operated by Advocate Health (formerly Advocate Aurora Health). The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones, drawing from Aurora Health Care's centralized medical records infrastructure. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also directs patients to its LiveWell patient portal for online record access.

## Forms and Pathways

Three forms were downloaded:

- **Form-1 and Form-2** are identical copies (same form number S300503 Rev. 11/25, same byte size) of the general "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a third-party release form designed for authorizing disclosure to other providers, insurers, or attorneys. Two URLs exist for the same document, a minor source of confusion.
- **Form-3** is a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" (S88411-EN Rev. 11/25) — explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It features a "Myself" checkbox, omits the purpose-of-release requirement, and opens with a callout to the LiveWell patient portal.

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3**. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, separate from the third-party authorization, is a meaningful structural choice that many organizations fail to make.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Aurora clearly differentiates individual access from third-party release. Form-3 is titled and structured around the patient's own request — no "Release the Requested Information to" recipient block, no purpose-of-release field, and a prominent "Myself" option. The patient portal callout ("Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org") is placed at the very top of the form, proactively directing patients to a faster digital channel before they even begin filling out the paper form. This is a best-practice design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Aurora Health Care maintains a well-organized medical records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records`, reachable in about two clicks from the homepage. The page clearly lists all available forms with download links, including English and Spanish versions, instruction sheets, restriction request forms, accounting of disclosures, and revocation forms. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The forms also appeared in web search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean typography and logical section flow: patient demographics → treatment context → record type selection → recipient → delivery method → signature. The record-type selection is impressively granular, with 22+ checkbox options spanning medical records, imaging by modality, billing documents, and laboratory reports. The language is plain and accessible — the sensitive-information acknowledgment is straightforward without being alarming.

However, despite being digitally produced, form-3 has **zero interactive fillable fields**. All checkboxes are static glyphs, and all blanks require handwriting. This is the form's most significant weakness — adding fillable fields would be trivial for the design team and would dramatically improve the digital experience. The form is designed as a print-and-fill artifact published as a PDF.

## Submission and Delivery

The medical records page lists multiple submission methods: email, fax, mail, and in-person delivery. The form itself offers multiple delivery methods for receiving records: paper by mail, encrypted email, CD, patient portal, and in-person pickup. Offering both encrypted email and patient portal as electronic delivery options is progressive. The note "(Fees may apply)" appears but no fee amounts or schedule are provided — a common ambiguity.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The form correctly omits a purpose-of-release requirement for patient access. Non-discrimination language is present on the third-party form. Minor authorization provisions are detailed and legally careful. The main compliance gap is the vague fee disclosure — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

## Overall Assessment

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton, through its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form, a patient portal alternative, Spanish translations, and granular record-type selection. The retrieval experience is excellent and the content design is clear and well-organized. The primary weakness is the non-fillable PDF format, which forces a paper workflow despite the form being digitally authored. This technical gap prevents the organization from reaching the top tier, but the overall experience is solidly good — a patient requesting their own records has a clear, well-documented pathway with multiple submission and delivery options.

**Grade: B** (weighted score: 4.15/5.0)

# Synthesis: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center

## Forms and Pathways

OSU Wexner Medical Center publishes two PDF forms on its [Medical Records page](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records), both titled "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (form ID MC040184, revised 11/2019). Form-1 is a single-page image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields — essentially a digitized paper artifact. Form-2 is a two-page digitally authored PDF that bundles numbered instructions (page 1) with the same authorization form (page 2). Form-2 has a full text layer and 25 embedded fonts but, despite being created in Adobe Acrobat Pro, still has zero fillable fields. Both forms use the same layout and legal text. Form-2 is clearly the better document and serves as the basis for this assessment.

The organization does not appear to offer a patient portal-based records request, an online submission wizard (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), or any other digital request pathway. Submission instructions list three physical mailing addresses and phone numbers for the Medical Information Management offices. No fax number or email address is listed for submitting the completed form. The form does accept eSignatures ("e.g., Adobe") with a date and time stamp, which opens the possibility that a patient could fill the form digitally using annotation tools and email or fax it — but no such submission channel is explicitly provided on the form itself.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

OSU Wexner does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same "Authorization to Release Medical Information" form is used whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney, insurer, or other third party is requesting them. The form's "Release Information To" section uses a sender-recipient model without any acknowledgment that a patient requesting their own records has distinct rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). There is no mention of the Right of Access anywhere on either form. Patients must complete the same "Purpose of Disclosure" field (with no guidance that they are not legally required to state a purpose for their own records), select facilities, and navigate the same legal text as any third-party requester.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned direct download links on the first attempt, and the forms are clearly linked from the organization's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor friction is the presence of two versions of the same form without guidance on which to use — a patient might download the image-only scan (form-1) and have a worse experience.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2's instructions page is a genuine bright spot: seven numbered items correspond to form sections, with practical guidance like "If uncertain about the location, select all box locations." The form itself offers granular record-type checkboxes (11 categories including Emergency Dept, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, Radiology, Pathology, etc.), multi-facility selection across 8 OSU locations, and reasonable purpose-of-disclosure options. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the form page is quite dense — it packs all fields, checkboxes, four paragraphs of legal text, signature lines, and three submission address blocks onto a single page, resulting in small font sizes and cramped spacing. The language mixes accessible instructions with HIPAA-derived terms ("designated record set," "re-disclosed by the recipient") that may confuse patients. Critically, despite being authored in Acrobat Pro, the form has no fillable fields — patients must print and handwrite.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is fee opacity. The form states "a fee may be charged" and directs all billing questions to CIOX Health (1-800-367-1500), a third-party ROI vendor, without any fee schedule or distinction between patient-access and third-party fees. For patient self-access, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts; the lack of transparency here raises concerns. The instructions require "all sections must be completed in their entirety," which means patients must state a purpose — not required by HIPAA for individual access. No notarization is required, and the witness signature is optional, which is positive. The form has not been updated since November 2019, predating the 2021 information blocking rules and 2024 42 CFR Part 2 revisions.

## Bright Spots

- Dedicated, well-structured instructions page with numbered items
- Granular record-type selection (11 categories)
- Multi-facility selection with practical guidance for uncertain patients
- eSignature acceptance (Adobe)
- Correct substance use disorder and psychotherapy notes disclosures

## Overall Assessment

OSU Wexner Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably organized ROI form with useful instructions, but falls short on digital accessibility (no fillable fields, no electronic submission channel), patient-centeredness (no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release), and fee transparency. The process is fundamentally a print-and-mail paper workflow dressed in a PDF wrapper.

# Rio Grande Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rio Grande Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Del Norte, Colorado. It offers a single downloadable PDF ROI form — a generic "Authorization for Release of Information" — used across both the hospital and its affiliated clinic. Importantly, the organization also provides embedded HIPAA-compliant JotForms on both the hospital and clinic patient records pages, giving patients an online submission pathway alongside the traditional PDF.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one PDF form was retrieved: **form-1.pdf**, a one-page "Authorization for Release of Information" created in Microsoft Word 2013 and uploaded in December 2018. The same PDF is linked from both the hospital and clinic records pages. In addition, each page embeds a separate JotForm (hospital JotForm ID: 220685534838162; clinic JotForm ID: 220685679526166) for online submission, providing a digital-first alternative to the downloadable PDF. The "FOR OFFICE USE ONLY" section on the PDF also references fax and mail as delivery methods used by staff.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Rio Grande Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses classic third-party authorization framing — "I authorize ___ to disclose my individually identifiable health information" — requiring the patient to fill in both a "To" and "From" entity. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should list Rio Grande Hospital as the "From" and themselves as the "To," which is workable but unintuitive. The form does include a "Personal Use" purpose checkbox, which is the closest acknowledgment that patients may be requesting records for themselves. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524, and no mention of electronic health information export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Web searches quickly surfaced the hospital's patient records pages, and the PDF had a descriptive URL. The JotForms are prominently featured on the pages, while the downloadable PDF sits in the sidebar — meaning the online pathway is actually more visible than the print form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was required.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable document with zero interactive form fields. Despite being digitally created (not a scan), it uses underscored blank lines for handwriting — a print-era design. At one page, it is appropriately concise. The layout follows a logical sequence (patient identity → parties → record types → HIV authorization → purpose → legal terms → signature), but the opening authorization paragraph is a dense, multi-line sentence covering communicable diseases, mental illness, and redisclosure warnings all at once. Record type options are limited to four checkboxes (History/Physical, Lab Results, X-Ray Reports, Other Diagnostic Reports) with no option for "all records," discharge summaries, medications, or billing. The form opens with "THIS REQUEST MUST BE FILLED OUT COMPLETELY" in emphasized text — a stern tone that could discourage patients uncertain about fields like SSN.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flag is the **SSN collection** — the form requests Social Security Number as a standard identifier alongside name and DOB, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk. The form also provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or reference to the online JotForm. A patient who downloads and fills the PDF has no clear next step. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeframe is stated. The form does not require notarization or a witness.

## Notable Strengths

The standout bright spot is the **online JotForm submission option**. While not part of the PDF itself, the organization provides a fully digital pathway for records requests via embedded web forms on both hospital and clinic pages. This is a meaningful investment in patient accessibility. The form's **non-conditioning language** ("I understand that my health care and the payment of my health care will not be affected if I do not sign this form") is a positive HIPAA compliance element. The **single-page format** keeps things concise. The HIV/STD/AIDS opt-in/opt-out structure with patient initials properly addresses Colorado's heightened protections for sensitive health information.

## Overall Assessment

Rio Grande Hospital provides a functional but dated records request experience. The PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no patient-access differentiation, no fillable fields, an unnecessary SSN field, and no submission instructions. However, the organization partially compensates with its JotForm-based online submission pathway, which gives patients a digital-first alternative. The best available pathway for a patient is the online JotForm, though the PDF form — the only downloadable document — falls short of modern patient-centered design. For a small independent critical access hospital, the investment in online forms is commendable, but the underlying authorization framework remains oriented toward third-party release rather than individual access rights.

# Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cottage Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Woodsville, NH, affiliated with the Rowe Health Center outpatient clinic. Two documents were retrieved: a standalone one-page "Authorization for Disclosure of Medical Information" (form-1) and a 12-page "RHC New Patient Packet" (form-2) containing a variant authorization form on page 2. Neither document is a dedicated patient access request form; both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was exceptionally difficult. The hospital's website (cottagehospital.org) is protected by Cloudflare Turnstile, which blocked all automated access — curl, browser with DevTools, and even Google's cache were inaccessible. The forms were ultimately recovered only through the Wayback Machine using archived snapshots from July 2024. Notably, the current versions of both documents (updated in 2024) were not captured by the Wayback Machine, meaning only older versions could be evaluated. A dedicated HIM department page exists on the site but could not be verified due to the access barrier. The form was linked from a "Becoming a Rowe Health Center Patient" page — framing the authorization as part of new-patient onboarding rather than a standalone records-request process.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Cottage Hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access form. Both retrieved documents are generic HIPAA authorization forms. Form-1's operative language — "authorize Cottage Hospital to use or disclose my protected health information to [other entity]" — is oriented entirely toward third-party release, with no clear mechanism for a patient to request records for themselves.

Form-2's page-2 authorization makes a meaningful improvement: it distinguishes "Self or Representative" from "Other Provider or Facility" as separate recipient categories, with different scope rules for each. Copies to patients default to "Complete copy of medical record, excluding psychotherapy notes," while third-party copies offer more granular selection. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot, showing intentional thought about different use cases. However, this better version is buried on page 2 of a 12-page new patient packet, which a patient searching for a records release form would have no reason to download based on the filename alone.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form has interactive/fillable fields despite both being digitally created in Microsoft Word. Patients must print and complete them by hand. Form-1 is a single page with approximately 12 fields — a manageable scope. The layout follows a logical flow (identification → recipient → record types → legal disclosures → signature), but lacks section headers or visual separators. Legal disclosures run as a continuous block of dense text with sentences exceeding 50 words. The form uses 5 fonts for a single page, and its footer reads "PAGE 14 OF 28" — a vestige of the larger policy document it was extracted from, which is confusing.

Both forms include confusing remuneration fields ("direct or indirect remuneration in the form of [describe]") that are required by HIPAA only for sale-of-PHI authorizations but will mystify patients making routine requests.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the complete absence of submission instructions on either form. No mailing address (beyond the hospital header), no fax number, no email, no mention of the HIM department as a submission point. A patient who completes the form has no guidance on how to deliver it. The witness signature line, while not explicitly marked as required, may lead patients to believe a witness is needed — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, and no response time is stated.

## Notable Strengths

The non-conditioning statement ("I MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION FORM") is prominently displayed in caps. Psychotherapy notes are properly segregated per 45 CFR § 164.508(b)(3)(ii). The 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure warning for substance abuse records is correctly included. Form-2's welcome letter is genuinely warm and accessible, and its billing section proactively discloses a 44% community health discount for self-pay patients.

## Red Flags

Form-2's General Consent for Treatment (Section 11) contains a blanket authorization allowing Cottage Hospital to disclose records "at its discretion" to any party liable for hospital charges, explicitly including substance abuse, psychiatric, and HIV records. This extremely broad authorization is bundled into routine intake paperwork, raising informed-consent concerns.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Hospital provides a minimally functional records release process that requires significant patient initiative to navigate. The Cloudflare-protected website, non-fillable forms, absence of submission instructions, and generic third-party framing create a cumulative experience that falls short of patient-centered design. The partial self-access accommodation in form-2 and proper HIPAA compliance language prevent the assessment from being worse, but this is a facility where requesting your own records would require calling the hospital for basic instructions.

# Northwestern Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Northwestern Memorial Hospital, part of the Northwestern Medicine / Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) system, publishes three documents related to medical records requests. The primary form is **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form 8094, rev. 2/2026) — a system-wide ROI authorization covering all 11 NMHC hospitals, physician groups, and behavioral health locations. **Form-3.pdf** is a full Spanish translation of the same form (8094SP, rev. 8/2024). **Form-2.pdf** is a separate inbound records request form for transferring records *into* NMHC from other providers — not relevant for patient self-access.

All forms are published at the system level on nm.org and are used across all NMHC entities. Northwestern Memorial Hospital does not maintain facility-specific forms.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Northwestern Medicine does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to attorneys, insurers, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" as the purpose, then list themselves as the recipient in the "Send Information To" section. This is functional but unintuitive: the form was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) anywhere on the form. This matters because Right of Access requests carry different fee limits and timing requirements than third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was trivially easy. A basic web search returned direct download links to the PDFs hosted on nm.org's media CDN. No website navigation, login, CAPTCHA, or bot-blocking was encountered. The URLs are descriptive and the forms are well-organized in the patients-and-visitors section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **79 fillable fields** — text inputs, checkboxes, and date fields can all be completed digitally without printing. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → facility selection → purpose → record types → delivery method → medical images → recipient → legal disclosures → signatures. Record-type categories include helpful parenthetical explanations (e.g., "Hospital Stay (History and physical, progress notes, consultations, operative reports, discharge summary, test results)") that help patients understand what they're requesting. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The legal disclosure section is moderately dense but covers required elements: 30-day response window, right to revoke, no care denial for refusal to sign, and sensitive-record opt-outs (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic testing, mental health). The language is somewhat complex but not impenetrably legalistic.

## Submission and Delivery

Submission options are strong: mail (Winfield, IL), fax (312.926.3093), and email (releaseofinformation@nm.org). Delivery options are notably forward-looking: **MyNM patient portal**, fax, email, and US mail (CD or paper). The portal delivery option is a standout feature that removes a common access barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or in-person requirements exist. Fees are referenced vaguely — "Standard record copying fees per 735 ILCS 5/8-2006 may apply" — without specific amounts or clarification that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a cost-based amount. This ambiguity could lead patients to expect the (higher) Illinois statutory copying fees even for personal-use requests.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form** with the same 82 fillable fields — Spanish-speaking patients get equal digital functionality
- **MyNM portal delivery** alongside fax, email, and mail
- **Email submission** (still uncommon among healthcare organizations)
- **Memorable toll-free number**: 877.9RECORD with TTY: 711 support
- **Parenthetical record-type explanations** helping patients understand each category

## Notable Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway — generic authorization form for all release types
- No reference to HIPAA Right of Access or patient access rights
- Fee language references Illinois statute without distinguishing patient-access fee limits
- Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version (missing hospital renaming, updated 42 CFR Part 2 language, and TTY reference)

## Overall Assessment

Northwestern Medicine provides a technically strong, easy-to-find form ecosystem with excellent digital features (fillable fields, email submission, portal delivery, Spanish translation). The primary weakness is structural: the organization channels all records requests — including patient self-access — through a generic authorization form designed for third-party release, without acknowledging the distinct rights and fee limits that apply to individual access under HIPAA. The form works well for patients who know what they need, but it wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# Vanderbilt University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Vanderbilt Health offers patients multiple pathways to request their medical records. The official medical records page at vanderbilthealth.com lists both downloadable PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish) and three online portals: a **Swellbox patient request portal**, a Swellbox provider request portal, and a ChartSwap third-party request portal. The separation of these portals by requester type — patient, provider, and third party — is a meaningful structural differentiator that many organizations lack.

Five PDF documents were discovered across Vanderbilt web properties. The current official English form is **form-4.pdf** (VMR 3017, dated 10/2023), a 2-page authorization linked from the main medical records page. Form-5 is its Spanish translation. Forms 1 and 2 are older versions (2022 and 2017 respectively) still publicly hosted on VUMC subdomains with no deprecation notice. Form-3 is an incoming-records form (release TO Vanderbilt) irrelevant to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Vanderbilt partially differentiates individual access from third-party release. At the portal level, the separation is clear: patients, providers, and third parties each have distinct Swellbox/ChartSwap entry points. However, at the PDF form level, Vanderbilt uses a single generic "Authorization for the Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — a HIPAA § 164.508 authorization form doing double duty for patient access requests that should technically fall under § 164.524 Right of Access. The form does correctly scope the purpose question in Section 8, noting it is only required "if not for your personal use," which recognizes patient self-access as the default. But the overall framing ("I hereby give Vanderbilt Health permission to disclose my individually identifiable protected health information") miscasts a patient right as a permission grant.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. The official vanderbilthealth.com medical records page clearly links both the English and Spanish PDFs under "Request Records by Authorization Form," and all downloads succeeded without bot blocking or login walls. The primary findability concern is that **outdated versions persist** on VUMC subdomains (student health, information privacy & security) — a patient searching Google could land on the 2017 or 2022 version, which has different fee structures, fewer facilities, and old branding, with no indication it's superseded.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4 is compact and well-organized, condensed from the older 4-page format to 2 pages with 10 numbered sections and clear bold headers. However, it is fundamentally an **image-only scan** — zero fillable fields, only 61 characters of extractable text, and no screen-reader accessibility. A patient must print it, complete it by hand, and submit via mail or fax. The electronic delivery option described in Section 4 (PDF through a request portal, directions sent to email) is a genuine patient-friendly feature. The fee schedule, while complex (6 scenarios), is transparently disclosed with all fees capped at $50 and a $6.50 flat rate for fully electronic delivery.

The form requests Last 4 SSN, which is more personal information than necessary. Section 9's acknowledgment section packs 11 bullet points of legal text in small font. The sensitive-information handling (Section 6) defaults to including psychiatric, substance use, and HIV information with an opt-out checkbox — permissible but puts the burden on the patient.

## Barriers and Strengths

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization or witness is required. Submission is possible via fax (adequate electronic pathway) and mail, plus the Swellbox portal provides a fully digital alternative. The 30-day response timeline is stated explicitly, and the form commits to no treatment conditioning. Fees are disclosed upfront and capped.

**Notable strengths** include: the Spanish-language version linked alongside the English form; the differentiated Swellbox patient portal as a digital alternative; the transparent and capped fee schedule; the correctly scoped purpose question; and the inclusion of an electronic delivery option via a request portal. The QR code on the form header may provide an additional pathway, though its destination isn't determinable from the PDF.

**Red flags** are the dual-purpose authorization framing, the persistence of outdated forms on subdomains, and the image-only scan format — surprising for a 2023 form from a major academic medical center that fails basic WCAG/Section 508 accessibility standards.

## Overall Assessment

Vanderbilt Health provides a **competent but imperfect** patient records request experience. The organization earns credit for offering differentiated digital pathways (Swellbox patient portal), a Spanish translation, transparent fees, and a well-organized 2-page form. It falls short on digital-first form design (image-only scan, no fillable fields) and conflates patient access rights with third-party authorization. The availability of the Swellbox portal as an alternative substantially mitigates the PDF's technical limitations, making this an organization that serves digitally-savvy patients reasonably well while leaving paper-dependent patients with an unnecessarily cumbersome experience.

# Arizona Community Physicians — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Arizona Community Physicians (ACP) is an independent, for-profit physician practice group in Tucson, Arizona. The organization maintains a well-organized patient forms page at azacp.com/forms/ with seven downloadable PDFs covering general records release, practice-specific release, imaging-specific release, adult/minor access designation, a Spanish minor access form, and a HIPAA amendment request. Critically, ACP also offers an online electronic records self-request wizard through Swellbox (swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html), providing a modern digital pathway alongside the paper forms.

## Relevant Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1.pdf** — the general "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (Form 100, revised 08/26/2024). However, ACP also provides the **Swellbox online wizard**, which is the superior pathway for a patient who wants to submit a request electronically without printing, hand-filling, and physically delivering a paper form. The forms page links to both options, giving patients a choice.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

ACP does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release, with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields that frame the transaction as a provider-to-provider or provider-to-entity transfer. The "TO" field is labeled "Name of Physician/Organization," implying the recipient should be another provider rather than the patient. A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name and address in that field, but the form provides no guidance for this use case. The purpose checkboxes include "At request of Patient," which at least acknowledges patient-initiated requests, but the form structure does not differentiate the legal framework (HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524 vs. authorization under § 164.508).

The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, may offer a more patient-centric experience as an electronic self-request tool, though its exact workflow was not evaluated as a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding ACP's forms was **easy**. The Patient Forms page is linked from the main website navigation, and multiple search strategies (web search, site-specific search, direct navigation) all returned direct PDF URLs. No login, bot blocking, or browser fallback was needed. The forms page is clearly organized and lists all seven documents. The Swellbox wizard link is also present on the forms page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF** with a native text layer. Despite being revised in August 2024, it has zero fillable fields — all blanks are underscore placeholders requiring printing and handwriting. The layout is clean and logically organized with capitalized section headers (PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM/TO, PURPOSE, TYPE OF INFORMATION). The language is generally plain and accessible, though the fee disclosure is confusingly placed as a footnote under the "Other" purpose checkbox rather than in its own section. The form collects a reasonable set of fields (~12-15 blanks) without requesting a Social Security Number — a positive privacy practice. It includes a "Former Name" field, which is a thoughtful inclusion.

The form offers three delivery format options (paper, disc/PDF, email), though email is restricted to "medical records processed by CIOX" without explaining what that means. The two-tier record type structure appropriately separates general records from protected records (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse) with distinct consent checkboxes.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness requirements.** Fees are disclosed at $0.07/page and $6.50/disc — both modest and within HIPAA limits — though "additional charges for shipping and handling" are mentioned without quantification. The one-year authorization expiration is standard. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated.

The most significant barrier is the **absence of submission instructions** on form-1 itself — no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal URL. A patient who downloads and prints the form has no idea where to send it. This is a functional defect. By contrast, form-7 (amendment request) includes explicit mail, fax, and in-person delivery instructions. The Swellbox wizard partially mitigates this by offering an entirely separate electronic pathway, but form-1 doesn't reference it.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox electronic self-request wizard** provides a modern digital alternative to the paper form ecosystem
- **Comprehensive form suite** — seven distinct documents covering diverse patient needs, including imaging-specific and amendment request forms
- **Spanish-language minor access form** (form-6) demonstrates language access awareness appropriate for Tucson's ~42% Hispanic population
- **No SSN collection** on the primary ROI form
- **Protected records separation** with distinct checkboxes for HIV, behavioral health, and substance abuse
- **HIPAA amendment request form** published online — uncommon among practices

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient self-access form** — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization
- **No fillable fields on any form** — all seven PDFs are flat, print-and-fill documents
- **No Spanish version of the primary ROI form** (form-1), despite Spanish availability for the minor access form
- **Missing submission instructions** on the primary ROI form
- **Fee disclosure placement** is confusing (buried under "Other" purpose checkbox)
- **1-year default records limitation** may surprise patients seeking complete history

## Overall Assessment

ACP demonstrates above-average organizational effort in making patient forms accessible online, with a well-organized forms page, a comprehensive suite of documents, and — crucially — a Swellbox electronic self-request option that elevates the patient experience beyond the paper-form baseline. However, the primary ROI form itself is a generic third-party authorization that doesn't distinguish patient self-access, lacks fillable fields, and omits submission instructions. The availability of the Swellbox pathway is the key differentiator that lifts ACP's overall assessment, though the paper form ecosystem could benefit from modernization and better patient-access-specific design.

# Coast Plaza Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Coast Plaza Hospital provides two versions of the same "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form on its Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`). Form-1 (June 2024, labeled "FINAL") is the current version; form-2 (January 2022) remains publicly accessible alongside it with no indication of which is current. Both are general-purpose ROI authorization forms — not patient-access-specific documents. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is to download form-1, print and hand-fill it, and fax or mail it to the hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Coast Plaza Hospital does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms use a single "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" workflow. The "Information to be Released to" section asks for "Name of Hospital/Clinic/Physician/Person," framing the recipient as a third party. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in this field, which is unintuitive. While "Personal Use" appears as a purpose option and "Records for Personal Use" as a record-type checkbox, the relationship between these is ambiguous — it's unclear whether selecting one, the other, or both is needed. The form lacks any Right of Access language or statement of patient rights beyond standard authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Multiple search strategies succeeded: a filetype:pdf web search and a site-scoped search both led to the hospital's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering was required. Both PDFs downloaded directly with curl. The only findability concern is the co-existence of two versions without clear versioning — a patient could easily download the outdated 2022 form, which lists a different fax number that may no longer be monitored.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created 2-page PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All ~20+ data entry points (patient name, address, DOB, phone, email, recipient information, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, date range, delivery method, signature) must be completed by hand after printing. The layout is well-organized with bold section headers ("Patient Information," "Information to be Released From," etc.) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. Record types are arranged efficiently in two columns with 16+ individual categories. The language is moderately legalistic — first-person authorization statements are standard but dense. A "PATIENT LABEL" box on both pages is a clinical workflow artifact that may confuse patients completing the form at home.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No fillable fields**: Forces a fully paper-based completion workflow in a form that was digitally designed and could easily support interactive fields.
- **CD-only electronic delivery**: The only electronic format option is CD — functionally obsolete in 2024. No email, portal, or secure download option exists.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "I understand that there may be a fee associated with this request" provides no fee amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee standard, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not tell patients where to send the completed authorization. The hospital's fax number appears in the "Released From" section but is not framed as a return destination.
- **Outdated form still online**: The 2022 version with a different fax number remains downloadable, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record selection**: 16+ specific record types give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **Sensitive category separation**: Mental Health, Genetic Testing, Alcohol/Drug Abuse, and HIV/AIDS records require separate initialing — correctly implementing federal and state requirements.
- **Encryption preference**: The form asks whether patients want records encrypted, a privacy-conscious option rarely seen on ROI forms.
- **No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature.

## Overall Assessment

Coast Plaza Hospital provides a findable, reasonably organized generic ROI form that a patient *can* use for self-access, but the experience is clearly not designed around patient needs. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, CD-only electronic delivery, and generic third-party framing all reflect a process built for institutional convenience rather than patient empowerment. The form earns credit for easy findability, granular record selection, and proper handling of sensitive categories, but falls short on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness.

# Texas Oncology — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Texas Oncology provides a single ROI form — an "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf). Both are 3-page fillable PDFs, structurally identical, revised 09/19/2024. They are available as direct downloads from a dedicated Medical Records page at texasoncology.com/medical-records. The page outlines a clear 3-step process: download the form, complete it, and submit by fax or mail.

No patient portal submission, online request wizard, or third-party vendor platform (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was found. The only request pathway is the downloadable PDF form submitted by fax or mail.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Texas Oncology does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party disclosure. The single form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering nine disclosure reasons — Treatment, Personal Use, Billing, Legal Purposes, Disability Determination, School, Employment, Health Oversight, and Other. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" and then navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios, including filling in both "I authorize the following to disclose" (naming Texas Oncology) and "Who can receive and use the health information?" (naming themselves). This is awkward when the requester and recipient are the same person.

Notably, page 2 of the form includes a legally accurate statement that "This form is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual," citing 45 CFR §§ 164.502(a)(1)(i) and 164.524. However, this critical information is buried in supplementary legal text — not surfaced on page 1 where a patient would see it before completing the 3-page form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible from footer navigation (approximately one click from the homepage). While older PDF URLs found via web search returned 404 errors due to a site migration to Sitecore Edge CDN, the live page links worked without issue. No bot blocking, login walls, or captchas were encountered. Overall retrieval difficulty: easy to moderate — the slight complication was dead legacy URLs, but the current page is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed fillable PDF with 95 interactive fields — a thoroughly digitized form designed for on-screen completion. The layout is clean and logical: patient demographics → reason for disclosure → authorizing party → recipient → delivery method → record types → time period → signature. Section headers in all caps provide clear visual hierarchy.

The form offers 16 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, radiology reports, pathology, etc.) plus "All Health Information" and "Other," giving patients meaningful granularity. Four sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, genetic information, HIV/AIDS) require separate initialing, consistent with HIPAA and Texas law.

The language is reasonably plain for a legal authorization form. The statement that treatment cannot be denied for refusing to sign is prominently placed at the top of page 1 — better positioning than many ROI forms. However, the fee language on page 2 contains a grammatical error ("There may charge a retrieval/processing fee") and fails to specify amounts or distinguish patient-access fees from third-party disclosure fees.

The 95 fillable fields lack semantic names in the PDF metadata (all field names are empty), which impairs accessibility for screen readers and assistive technology.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Barriers are low to moderate.** No notarization is required — only a patient signature. No in-person submission is required; fax and mail are both accepted. The authorization expiration is reasonable (valid until death, revocation, or optional specified date). Right to revoke is clearly stated. The form includes current reproductive health protections (45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)) with a dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page — demonstrating up-to-date compliance with 2024 federal rules.

The main barrier is the lack of electronic submission: despite the fillable PDF and email as a records *delivery* option, patients must still print, sign, and fax or mail the form. There is no e-signature, portal upload, or online submission pathway.

Fee disclosure is vague — "a retrieval/processing fee may be charged" without specifics. No response time commitment is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: A professionally translated Spanish version is offered as a parallel download — commendable for a Texas-based practice serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **Reproductive health protections**: The dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page is current with 2024 federal law.
- **Email delivery option**: Records can be delivered via email, providing a practical electronic access mechanism.
- **Treatment-not-conditioned**: Prominently positioned at the top of page 1.

## Overall Assessment

Texas Oncology provides a competent but generic records request experience. The form is well-built as a document — fillable, logically organized, bilingual, and legally current. However, it funnels patients through a third-party authorization process rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. The buried acknowledgment that the form "is not required" for patient self-access only underscores this mismatch. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience. The organization earns a **B** grade — solid document quality and accessibility, held back by the lack of a patient-centered access pathway.

# Fisher-Titus Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fisher-Titus Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Norwalk, Ohio. Three documents were downloaded from the organization's website: two versions of the same "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form (form-1.pdf revised 11/2024 and form-3.pdf revised 07/2025, both carrying form number FTC24-5) and an unrelated Emergency Medical Authorization form (form-2.pdf) for minor children. The relevant documents for patient self-access are the two ROI authorization forms, with form-3.pdf being the more current revision.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient Self-Access Accommodation

Fisher-Titus does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. Instead, it provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form that serves all release-of-information purposes — patient self-access, third-party releases to attorneys, insurers, and other providers alike. However, the form includes a notable accommodation: a **"Self (same info as above)" checkbox** in the recipient section (Section 2), which explicitly lets patients indicate they are requesting their own records without having to fill out a separate recipient name and address. A "Personal" purpose option in Section 4 further supports this use case.

Despite these accommodations, the form's framing — titled "Authorization to Disclose PHI" — and its overall design orient around third-party disclosure. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access, no plain-language explanation of patient rights, and no guidance distinguishing the patient self-access process from a third-party release. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different primary audience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. It is reachable within two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Guests → Patient Forms) and is also available on a dedicated Medical Records page (/medical-records). No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-rendered links were encountered. URLs are descriptively named. The two independent navigation paths to the form are above average for a community hospital. One confusing element: the Patient Forms page links to the older revision (form-1.pdf) while the Medical Records page links to the newer revision (form-3.pdf), with no indication to the patient which version is current.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-3.pdf, revised 07/2025) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with extractable text. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as typographic underscores, and checkboxes are non-interactive Unicode characters. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand or use a PDF annotation tool. This is a print-first design distributed digitally.

The form's structure is well-organized with **eight clearly numbered sections** following a logical progression: patient info → recipient → treatment location → purpose → record types → format/delivery → sensitive information consent → expiration/signature. Section 5 provides impressively granular record selection with approximately 17 specific record type checkboxes (discharge summaries, H&P, operative reports, lab, pathology, radiology images, immunizations, ED records, etc.), each with date fields. Patients can request their entire record or specific items.

The language is **moderately clear** — section headers are descriptive and the flow is intuitive, but legal boilerplate in Sections 7 and 8 uses complex sentence structures typical of authorization forms. A patient of average literacy could complete the form, though the dense Section 5 and legal consent language may slow them down. Approximately 20–25 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN requested**: Section 1 asks for "SS#" (Social Security Number), which is unnecessary for patient access under HIPAA and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Witness Signature" line appears at the bottom with no explanation of when or whether a witness is required, potentially deterring patients who lack a convenient witness.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: The form states Fisher-Titus "may charge a fee" but provides no fee schedule, amounts, or indication of whether patient self-access requests are free.
- **Two conflicting versions online**: The older and newer revisions differ in content (sensitive information categories, specialty office listings) but share the same form number, risking patient confusion.

## Bright Spots

- **Encrypted email as a delivery format**: Fisher-Titus offers encrypted email alongside CD, flash drive, and paper for records delivery — a progressive option for a community hospital.
- **Granular record selection**: The 17+ record type checkboxes with date fields give patients fine-grained control over their request scope.
- **"Self" checkbox**: The explicit self-request accommodation, while not a dedicated patient form, reduces friction compared to forms that only contemplate third-party recipients.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Fax numbers are listed for each treatment location, and mail and in-person options are available — ensuring patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fisher-Titus Medical Center provides an accessible, reasonably well-designed records request process hampered by a print-only form design and a generic authorization framework that does not truly center patient self-access. The form is easy to find, logically organized, and offers progressive delivery options including encrypted email. However, the lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of patient rights language or fee transparency pull the overall experience down. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience with that patient in mind as the primary audience.

# Merit Health Central — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Merit Health Central is a for-profit community hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, part of Community Health Systems (CHS) operating under the Merit Health brand. The facility uses system-standardized forms for records requests and also offers an online portal alternative via Swellbox. Two PDF forms were retrieved — English (HIM-1406) and Spanish (HIM-1406S) versions of the same document — both linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page.

## Available Pathways & Primary Form

The primary form (form-1.pdf, HIM-1406) is titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** — notably not "Authorization for Release" or similar third-party-oriented language. The form allows patients to request records for themselves, a personal representative, or a third party, with "Myself" listed as the first recipient option. A Spanish translation (form-2.pdf, HIM-1406S) with identical structure and 66 fillable fields is provided alongside. The website also offers an online request process via Swellbox (swellbox.com/merit-health-jackson-wizard.html), giving patients a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Merit Health Central does not maintain separate forms for patient self-access vs. third-party release — both use cases are served by the same HIM-1406 form. However, the form is clearly designed with patient self-access as the primary use case: the title, structure, and "Myself" first-option framing all signal a patient-access orientation. The form explicitly distinguishes recipients (self, personal representative, third party) with labeled options. This is a meaningful step above the generic third-party authorization model, even though a truly separate patient access pathway does not exist.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/request-medical-records`. The page sits under "Patients & Visitors" navigation with clearly labeled English and Spanish download links. An FAQ section addresses common questions about authorization, charges, and who can request records — providing useful context before the patient downloads anything. No bot-blocking or browser fallback issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a born-digital, single-page interactive PDF with 66 fillable fields — an exceptionally high count that means virtually every input area is digitally completable. The layout follows a logical seven-section flow: patient information, facility identification, record type selection (12 checkbox categories), sensitive information disclosure (5 categories with individual opt-in checkboxes), delivery method selection, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and direct, with clear section headers framed as patient-facing questions. The one-page format is impressively concise given the coverage.

The form offers five delivery methods: paper, email (with risk acknowledgment), removable media (DVD/USB/CD-ROM with password protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media with password protection is an unusually thoughtful option. The HIPAA acknowledgment in the footer — "This Healthcare Facility recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information" — explicitly references patient rights, though it could be more prominent.

## Barriers & Concerns

No major barriers were identified. No notarization is required, there is no in-person-only submission requirement, and the form avoids consent bundling. However, three ambiguities merit attention: (1) fee disclosure is vague — "There may be charges" with no amounts, schedules, or reference to HIPAA cost-based limits; (2) the form itself does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization (no fax number, email, or mailing address on the form); and (3) a witness signature field is present without explanation of when a witness is required, which may confuse patients completing the form remotely.

## Notable Strengths

The Spanish translation is a genuine bright spot — a fully functional, equally prominent parallel form rather than an afterthought. The Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital alternative for patients who prefer not to deal with PDF workflows. The patient-first titling and structure, comprehensive delivery options, and high fillable field count collectively demonstrate above-average attention to patient access needs. The system-standardized form (revised six times since 2018) suggests ongoing maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Merit Health Central provides a well-above-average patient records request experience. The combination of a patient-focused PDF form, Spanish translation, and online Swellbox portal covers multiple access modalities. The form's digital-first design, logical layout, and comprehensive options serve patients well. Minor shortcomings — vague fee language, missing submission instructions on the form itself, witness field ambiguity — prevent a top-tier rating but do not materially impede patient access. This is a solid B-level performance.

# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Anchorage, Alaska. Two documents were retrieved from its publicly accessible forms page: a primary ROI authorization form ("Advanced Authorization for Release of Information," Rev. 08/2025) and a standing PHI Disclosure Agreement (Rev. 8/4/23). Of these, form-1 is the relevant document for a patient requesting copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

ANHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary ROI form (form-1) is a dual-purpose generic HIPAA authorization covering both "obtain information from" an external source and "release information to" a third party. A patient wanting their own records must check "Release Information to" and fill in their own name and address as the recipient — functional, but not intuitive. The form's instructions frame it around sending records elsewhere, not around the patient's individual Right of Access. There is no separate, simplified pathway for patients who just want their own records.

That said, the form does include a notably strong patient-rights statement: it explicitly cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and tells patients they are "NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information." This is uncommon and commendable, partially compensating for the generic form structure.

The retrieval notes also mention a text-based ROI request option (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which could be a more accessible alternative channel, though its scope and workflow aren't detailed on the forms page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped search surfaced the ANHC forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms), which is well-organized with clear section headings including a "Request a Release of Information" section with direct PDF links. No bot blocking, captchas, or authentication barriers were encountered. The form was also available in Spanish, which is a notable accessibility feature for an FQHC. Difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally composed document — not a scan — with a clean text layer and reasonable file size (164 KB). However, despite being revised as recently as August 2025, it has **zero fillable PDF fields**. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and return it via fax or in person. This is a significant missed opportunity for a document that is clearly digitally designed.

The form collects approximately 15 fields: patient name, DOB, last four SSN digits, two phone numbers, full address, recipient information, record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization, date range, and signature. Requesting SSN digits is unnecessary for a records request and adds friction. The form fits everything on one page, which is efficient but dense. Layout is adequate with clear section divisions, though the volume of content compressed onto a single page limits whitespace.

Language is generally accessible. The introductory "PLEASE READ" paragraph is clear and plain-language. The legal disclosure section is denser but not impenetrable, covering authorization voluntariness, expiration, revocation rights, and redisclosure prohibitions. There is a typo ("heath care" instead of "health care") and a malformed HIPAA citation in the legal text.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Fees**: The form discloses that ANHC charges for copies, with an exception for facility-to-facility transfers. It does not clarify that patient self-access requests are subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee limits, which could discourage patients.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting the last four SSN digits is unnecessary and creates friction.
- **No notarization** required — positive.
- **Submission**: Fax (907-743-7255) is available as an electronic submission method. The form also lists the physical address. No email or portal submission option exists for the ROI form itself, though ANHC does use MyChart (referenced in form-2).
- **Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit HIPAA Right of Access citation** (45 CFR § 164.524) with clear patient-empowering language
- **Spanish-language version** of the ROI form available
- **Text-message alternative** for initiating ROI requests
- **Recently revised** (08/2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Adolescent privacy protections** on form-2 (MyChart proxy access controls for minors 12–17)

## Overall Assessment

ANHC presents a mixed picture. The forms are easy to find, the website is well-organized, and several bright spots — Spanish availability, text-message option, explicit HIPAA rights language — show genuine attention to patient access. However, the core pathway funnels patients through a generic third-party authorization form rather than offering a dedicated patient self-access route, the primary PDF has no fillable fields despite recent revision, and the fee language could discourage patients from exercising their rights. For an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations, the lack of a fillable digital form is a notable gap. The organization earns credit for accessibility features and rights transparency, but falls short on digital form quality and access pathway differentiation.

# Riverside Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Riverside Community Hospital, an HCA Healthcare facility in Riverside, CA, provides three downloadable authorization forms for medical records release. **Form-2** (English, 1 page, 52 fillable fields) is the current official document, linked directly from the hospital's [medical records page](https://www.riversidecommunityhospital.com/patient-resources/medical-records). **Form-3** is a Spanish-language equivalent with identical structure and field count. **Form-1** is an older, 5-page non-fillable version hosted by a third-party ROI vendor (Legal Image) that is no longer linked from the hospital's website. The retrieval notes also mention a MyHealthONE patient portal and a Swellbox-based online request wizard, though the PDF forms remain the primary documented pathway.

## Patient Self-Access vs. Third-Party Release

Riverside Community Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization for Release of PHI" documents designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-2 does include a checkbox distinguishing "At the request of the individual" from "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form's overall structure still centers on designating a separate "Recipient" — a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own name and address as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 (right of access), no mention of the 30-day response deadline for patient access requests, and no distinction in fee treatment between patient access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HCA corporate template (HCA-840-00434), not something designed with the patient self-request experience in mind.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy** — the medical records page is accessible within 1-2 clicks from the main website under Patient Resources. Both English and Spanish forms are directly linked as downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that form-1 is served over HTTP (not HTTPS) by the third-party vendor, but this is not the primary form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is technically strong. It is a genuinely digital-first, fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields — checkboxes, radio buttons, and text fields — all on a single page. A patient can complete the form on-screen without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (A: authorization details, B: marketing/PHI sale, C: signatures), with 16 granular record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. The language is formal and clinical but generally comprehensible. However, the single-page format makes the form quite dense, and there are no standalone instructions or guidance text on the form itself (unlike form-1's two-page instruction set). The USCDI release request option is a rare and forward-looking inclusion, though the technical jargon ("Requires Direct Address or National Provider Identifier") would be meaningless to most patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. No notarization or witness signature is required. Submission can be made by mail (to HCA's Nashville, TN processing center) or by fax, satisfying the baseline for electronic submission. The SSN field is present but marked optional. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("a reasonable copy fee") without specifying amounts or distinguishing patient access from third-party release. No response time commitment is stated. The centralized Nashville mailing address means local submission is not mentioned on the current form, though a patient could potentially submit in person at the hospital's HIM department.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language parity**: Form-3 is a fully equivalent Spanish version with the same 52 fillable fields — genuine language access for Riverside's majority-Hispanic community.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare among ROI forms and signals awareness of interoperability standards.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure).
- **52 fillable fields**: Among the most technically complete fillable forms observed.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Patients are funneled through the same generic authorization form used for insurance companies and attorneys.
- **No right-of-access language**: The form never informs patients of their HIPAA right to access their own records or the associated protections (fee limits, 30-day timeline).
- **Centralized processing**: All requests route to Nashville, TN — no local submission address on the current form.
- **Grammar error persists**: "obtain a copy the information" (missing "of") appears across all form versions.

## Overall Assessment

Riverside Community Hospital delivers a technically competent but patient-generic records request experience. The fillable PDF, Spanish-language version, and multiple delivery options represent genuine strengths. However, the organization treats patient self-access as just another type of third-party release, missing an opportunity to provide a streamlined, patient-centered pathway. A patient can get their records through this process, but they receive no guidance tailored to their situation and may not understand their rights. The overall experience earns a **B** — solid technical execution held back by a one-size-fits-all approach to records access.

# UPMC Presbyterian — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

UPMC Presbyterian uses the system-wide UPMC "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (form-1.pdf), a two-page PDF hosted on UPMC's Digital Asset Management CDN. Two additional documents were found: an In-Home Urgent Care variant (form-2.pdf) for home-based care services, and an informational guide (form-3.pdf) that walks patients through completing the main form. The primary form relevant to a patient at UPMC Presbyterian requesting their own hospital records is form-1.pdf.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UPMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to physicians, insurers, attorneys, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form used for third-party release, selecting "Personal Use" as the purpose and listing themselves as the recipient. However, UPMC does include a notable inline annotation: **"Purpose is not required for patient access,"** a clear acknowledgment of HIPAA individual access rights that most organizations omit. This partially bridges the gap, but the form's structure — "I authorize UPMC to release information to: [Facility/Person to Receive Records]" — remains fundamentally oriented toward release to third parties. There is no separate patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a MyChart-based records request workflow in the materials reviewed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links on UPMC's CDN. The form is prominently linked from both the system-wide medical records page and the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page. No bot blocking, broken links, or login requirements were encountered. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a **born-digital but print-first PDF**. Despite being created digitally (22 embedded fonts, not a scan), it has essentially no fillable fields — only 1 unnamed interactive field was detected across the entire document. All data entry points use underscore-style blank lines and checkbox squares intended for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit it via mail or fax.

The form is **extremely dense**. Page 1 packs facility selection (14+ UPMC hospitals), patient demographics, recipient information, purpose, disclosure format, delivery method, record type selection (20+ specific document types), sensitive-information opt-outs, expiration terms, and signature blocks onto a single page. While the logical flow is sound (sections labeled A through C), the tight spacing and small text create a visually overwhelming experience. Page 2 contains patient rights and responsibilities disclosures.

The language mixes plain English with legal terminology. Instructions like "Parts 1 and 2 below must be completed" are clear, but fee language and re-disclosure warnings are dense. The 20+ record-type checkboxes offer impressive granularity but may overwhelm patients who simply want "all my records."

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Fee language is ambiguous for patient access.** The form states "charges may be associated with this request" citing Pennsylvania state law, without distinguishing patient access (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) from third-party requests. The phrase "records will be sent upon receipt of payment" could be read as conditioning access on pre-payment.
- **90-day default authorization expiration** is unusually short and may force resubmission if processing is slow, though patients can specify up to one year.
- **No fillable fields** despite born-digital creation is a missed opportunity that forces a paper workflow.
- **Fax delivery restricted to "Providers Only"** — patients cannot receive records by fax, though email and Direct Address are available as electronic delivery alternatives.

## Notable Strengths

- **Companion instruction guide** (form-3.pdf) is a rare patient-friendly resource that explains each section with plain-language examples (e.g., "Inpatient: Admitted for treatment or surgery with overnight stay in hospital").
- **"Purpose is not required for patient access"** — an unusually clear inline acknowledgment of HIPAA rights.
- **Email and Direct Address delivery options** demonstrate awareness of digital access preferences.
- **Anti-conditioning statement** explicitly states UPMC will not condition treatment on signing.
- **Oral authorization provision** for patients physically unable to sign, with two-witness requirements.

## Overall Assessment

UPMC Presbyterian provides an accessible, findable ROI form with some genuinely patient-friendly features — particularly the companion guide and the "purpose not required" note. However, the organization funnels all record requests through a single generic authorization form that was designed for third-party release, lacks interactive form fields despite being born-digital, and uses ambiguous fee language that doesn't clearly distinguish patient access rights. The result is a process that a motivated patient can navigate but that was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. For a major academic health system, the lack of any digital-first submission pathway (online portal, fillable PDF, or web form) is a notable gap.

# University of Texas Medical Branch — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UTMB provides three downloaded documents, but the most important distinction is between two form types: **Form 7033** ("Patients Request for Medical Records," form-1.pdf, dated April 2023) is a dedicated patient self-request form, while **Form 7032** (form-2.pdf, revised May 2024) is a general HIPAA authorization for third-party release. A third document (form-3.pdf) is an outdated 2016 version of Form 7032 hosted by Champion Records Service, a third-party ROI vendor. For a patient requesting their own records, **Form 7033 is the relevant document**.

UTMB also offers an online portal through Datavant/Swellbox as a digital alternative to the paper forms, and the medical records page references this option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UTMB earns genuine credit for maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access versus third-party release** — a design choice that relatively few organizations make. Form 7033 omits irrelevant fields (purpose of request, representative documentation requirements) and adds patient-relevant features (MyChart delivery, email delivery, email encryption disclosure). Form 7032, by contrast, has only a "Signature of Authorized Personal Representative" line with no patient signature option, and requires documentation of authority to act on the patient's behalf. This structural separation demonstrates intentional consideration of the patient self-request use case.

However, the forms do not cross-reference each other. A patient who finds Form 7032 (whether on UTMB's site or the third-party copy) has no indication that the more appropriate Form 7033 exists.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy to moderate**. A single web search surfaced UTMB's medical records page at `utmb.edu/utmbhealth/online-services/medical-records`, which lists forms with download links under a logical "Online Services > Request Medical Records" navigation path. The complication is that PDFs are hosted on SharePoint (`liveutmb.sharepoint.com`), which requires browser-based download — programmatic access (curl) returns login pages. For a typical patient using a web browser, this is a non-issue.

## Form Document Quality

Form 7033 is a **single-page, text-based PDF** with a clean text layer (no OCR artifacts, not an image scan). It flows logically: patient identification → recipient/delivery method → record scope → expiration → signature → submission instructions. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all fields must be completed by hand after printing or via PDF annotation tools. This is the primary technical shortcoming.

The form offers **four delivery options** for records: mail, fax, email, and MyChart Patient Portal. It also provides **three submission methods** for the form itself: mail, fax, and email (himrio@utmb.edu). The email submission option is a notable convenience that eliminates the need for a printer or fax machine.

Language is generally clear and functional, though institutional rather than warm. The email encryption risk disclosure is a model of transparent, plain-language communication. The form asks for approximately 10–12 fields (name, address, DOB, phone, recipient info, record scope, dates, signature).

## Barriers and Gaps

- **No fillable fields**: Despite digital distribution, the form cannot be completed electronically in standard PDF readers.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. HIPAA limits patient access fees to a reasonable, cost-based amount, but patients have no idea what to expect.
- **No turnaround time stated**: No response timeline is communicated.
- **No patient rights statement**: The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access or explain patient rights.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records are authorized in a single blanket statement with no opt-out mechanism for individual categories.
- **No multilingual support**: Notable for a Galveston, TX institution serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — email, fax, and mail are all available.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-request form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **MyChart portal delivery option** on the authorization form itself — few organizations integrate portal delivery directly into their ROI form.
- **Email submission** of the completed form at himrio@utmb.edu — lowers the barrier significantly.
- **Transparent email encryption disclosure** — clearly written, appropriately informative without being alarming.
- **Datavant/Swellbox online portal** as a digital alternative pathway.

## Overall Assessment

UTMB demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its structural decision to maintain separate patient and third-party forms, and through the variety of delivery and submission options. The organization clearly thought about the patient self-access use case. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (undermining the digital workflow), absence of fee/rights/turnaround information, and no multilingual support. The availability of email submission and an online portal partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF. Overall, UTMB earns a **B grade** — meaningfully better than average, with room for improvement in document interactivity and patient education.

# Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital is a community hospital in Fairfield, Ohio, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system. Medical records requests are managed centrally through the parent system's website at mercy.com, which provides a dedicated medical records request page covering all Mercy Health facilities. The hospital is listed as a checkbox option on the Cincinnati-region authorization form, with a dedicated fax number (513-599-4491).

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were downloaded. **Form-1** is an older Cincinnati-region "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (MHP 0786 Rev 1/19) with a full text layer and 5,192 characters of extractable text. **Form-2** is a newer system-wide version of the same form (printed 2024-01-17), but it is an image-only scan with only 46 characters of metadata — a significant regression in digital accessibility. Form-2 is the version currently linked from the medical records page; form-1's URL still works but is no longer prominently linked.

Beyond PDF forms, Mercy Health offers **MyChart** (patient portal) and an **online eRequest system** through Ciox/Datavant (Swellbox) at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html, providing genuinely electronic alternatives. A **Spanish-language** version of the authorization form is also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for all release-of-information purposes, not dedicated patient access forms. However, the form does accommodate patient self-access reasonably well: **"Self" is the first checkbox** in the recipient section, and the default purpose is "For Personal use if not otherwise stated." The form explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 (the individual right of access provision). While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, patient self-access is clearly a recognized use case rather than an afterthought.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately returned the Mercy Health medical records page. The centralized page is well-organized with facility-specific fax numbers, links to forms (English and Spanish), and information about MyChart and eRequest options. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing the best available PDF form (form-1, the text-layer version): it is a **single-page**, well-organized form with a logical flow from patient demographics through facility selection, date range, record types, recipient, delivery method, purpose, and legal disclosures. The form offers granular record-type checkboxes (10 specific categories plus "Other" and "Entire record") and four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email). Format defaults to electronic (PDF/CD) if unspecified.

However, neither form has **fillable fields** — both require printing and handwriting. Form-1 at least has a proper text layer making it searchable and compatible with assistive technology. Form-2, the currently linked version, is a flat scan that is completely inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally at all. The replacement of a functional digital PDF with an image scan is a notable regression.

## Barriers

- **Photo ID required**: The form states "Photo ID required at the time of request," which could exclude patients without government-issued identification.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "There may be a charge for copies of records" provides no specific amounts or fee schedule.
- **"Standard two years" default**: The "Entire record" option defaults to two years of information unless otherwise specified — patients expecting their full history may receive only a subset.
- No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission — fax, mail, MyChart, and secure email are available.

## Notable Strengths

- Multiple request pathways including MyChart and Swellbox/Datavant online portal
- Spanish-language form available
- "Self" as the first recipient option; electronic format as default
- Explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation
- Single-page form design
- Centralized, easy-to-navigate medical records page

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The availability of MyChart and the Swellbox online portal significantly elevates the digital pathway beyond the PDF forms alone. The PDF forms themselves are adequate in content design but limited by the lack of fillable fields, and the current primary linked form (an image scan) represents a troubling accessibility regression. The generic HIPAA authorization approach — while clearly accommodating patient self-access — falls short of a dedicated patient access pathway. The overall experience is functional but not exemplary.

# WellSpan York Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

WellSpan York Hospital is part of WellSpan Health, a regional nonprofit health system in Pennsylvania. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms at the system level on wellspan.org. **Form-1.pdf** ("Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information," Form #2606, Rev. 08/25) is the primary system-wide form applicable to York Hospital and all other WellSpan facilities. **Form-2.pdf** ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information") is scoped exclusively to three WellSpan neighborhood hospitals (Newberry, Shrewsbury, Carlisle) and does not apply to York Hospital. The assessment below focuses on form-1.pdf as the relevant patient pathway.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WellSpan does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form or pathway distinct from third-party release. Form-1.pdf is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization with a bidirectional "Obtain from" / "Disclose to" structure designed for third-party transfers. However, the form does include a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an unusually clear statement of the right to self-access: *"I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."* This language partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated pathway, but a patient must still navigate a form framed around releasing records to another party and figure out how to adapt it for self-access (e.g., writing their own name in the "Disclose to" field).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A straightforward web search immediately returned a direct PDF link on wellspan.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. Multiple search strategies all converged on the same document. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1.pdf is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a complete text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally created, all fields are blank underscored lines, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient identification flows into record source/destination, then record type selection, purpose, delivery format, sensitive-records disclosure, legal terms, signatures, and submission instructions. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records paragraph on page 1 is a dense run-on sentence that could benefit from formatting improvements.

Record type options are well structured with five top-level categories (Abstract with detailed sub-list, Diagnostic Test Results, Imaging, Billing, and Complete record). Delivery format options are a standout feature: patients can choose Paper, CD, Fax, or Email, where the email option delivers records through a secure portal as PDFs available for 30 days.

## Barriers & Compliance

The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's SSN — an unnecessary data collection practice that introduces privacy risk without being required for patient identification. A witness signature line on page 2 creates ambiguity about whether a witness is routinely required or only for specific circumstances. Fees are mentioned as "regulated by state and federal law" but no specific amounts are disclosed. Notably, form processing is handled by MRO Corporation, a third-party ROI vendor, meaning patients interact with MRO rather than WellSpan directly.

On the positive side: the form explicitly accepts copies in lieu of originals, does not require notarization, and clearly states that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing. The 12-month authorization window is reasonable.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit the completed form via **fax** (717-812-8119), **email** (PatientRequests@wellspan.org), or **mail** to the York, PA HIM office. The availability of fax and email means patients are not required to physically visit the facility or rely solely on postal mail.

## Overall Assessment

WellSpan York Hospital provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed authorization form with modern delivery options (secure portal) and explicit right-to-self language. However, the absence of fillable fields in a born-digital PDF, the generic third-party authorization structure, the SSN collection, and witness ambiguity prevent it from reaching the top tier. The organization serves patients adequately but has clear room for improvement in both digital accessibility and patient-centered design.

# Emory University Hospital — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Emory University Hospital, part of the Emory Healthcare system, offers four documents on its medical records page: a current English ROI authorization form (form-1, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), a legacy 4-page ROI package (form-2, ~September 2022), a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), and a Request for Amendment form (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting records is form-1, the current English authorization. Emory also provides a Swellbox/Datavant online records request wizard as an alternative digital pathway.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Emory does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release authorization. The primary form is a generic "Authorization for the Release of Protected Health Information" used for all release scenarios — patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties all use the same document. However, the form does include "At my request" as a named purpose option, and its delivery methods include MyChart and EHI Export, signaling awareness that patients are a key audience. A patient requesting their own records must fill themselves in as the recipient, navigating a form framework designed around the third-party release paradigm. The Swellbox portal offers a somewhat more guided digital alternative, but the overall process does not clearly distinguish HIPAA Right of Access requests from general authorization-based releases.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A targeted web search for Emory Healthcare medical records forms surfaced the PDF URL directly, and the medical records page at `emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records` is well-organized with clear links to all relevant documents — English and Spanish authorization forms, fee sheets, e-delivery instructions, amendment form, and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed. The descriptive filename convention (`english-authorization-form-fillable-revised-11-2025.pdf`) is a small but meaningful usability detail. One minor issue: the URL path includes a `/wr/` segment (likely referencing the Warner Robins facility), which could confuse patients at other Emory locations.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely fillable 2-page PDF with approximately 100 interactive fields (checkboxes and text inputs), though the PDF's AES-256 encryption caused metadata tools to report zero fillable fields. The form is organized into numbered sections covering facility selection (18+ Emory Healthcare locations), recipient and delivery information, record type specification (17+ granular checkboxes with date fields), and purpose. The layout is clean and logical. Language is a mix of clear structural labels and moderately dense legal text on page 2 (revocation rights, re-disclosure warnings, sensitive information waiver). The form is not tagged for screen reader accessibility.

A notable strength is the range of delivery options: paper, CD, USB drive, MyChart, mail, pick-up, e-delivery website, email, and — remarkably — **EHI Export**, a forward-thinking option that very few organizations surface on their authorization forms. The Spanish-language version (form-3) mirrors the English structure, though it has character encoding issues (accented characters rendering as digits) and incomplete translation of institutional terms.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. No in-person submission requirement exists — patients can fax or use the Swellbox portal. The primary form does not disclose fees directly; a separate fee sheet ($6.50 flat for electronic delivery, $0.07/page for paper) is available on the medical records page. The legacy form-2 required a separate fee acknowledgment signature, but the current form-1 does not. The form does include a blanket waiver for sensitive information (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health) that does not allow patients to opt out of releasing specific sensitive categories — a common but patient-unfriendly approach.

## Overall Assessment

Emory Healthcare provides a competent, well-organized records request process with several standout features — particularly the EHI Export delivery option, the Spanish-language form, and the Swellbox online portal. The forms are easy to find, fillable, and recently updated. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must use the same generic authorization form as third-party requesters, without clear guidance on how to request their own records specifically. The form accommodates patient requests but was not designed around them as a first-class use case. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and well-maintained, but not yet patient-centered in its design philosophy.

# Montefiore Nyack Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Montefiore Nyack Hospital (part of Montefiore Health System) publishes a single "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available in two versions. The current version (form-1.pdf, Rev. 01/2022) is a 3-page fillable PDF linked from the hospital's [Medical Records page](https://www.montefiorenyack.org/manage-my-care/medical-records). An older version (form-2.pdf, Rev. 10/2021) remains accessible at its original URL but is no longer linked from the website. Both forms are facility-branded rather than system-wide Montefiore Health System forms.

The hospital provides three submission channels: fax (845-348-8433), email (ROI@montefiorenyack.org), and phone (845-348-2527), with a physical mailing address also listed. Electronic delivery of records via email is explicitly offered — a notable positive.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Montefiore Nyack does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA release serving patients, attorneys, and "other individuals/companies" as parallel options under a single "RELEASE THE REQUESTED RECORDS TO" section. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or any framing that acknowledges patients have a legal right to their records. The transaction is characterized entirely as an "authorization to release" — a third-party authorization framework applied to patient self-access. A patient can select "PATIENT" as the recipient, but must navigate a form that equally serves attorneys and other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL, and the form is one click from the Medical Records page. The only friction was technical: the site's CDN/WAF blocks automated downloads (curl requests return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. This bot-blocking is likely unintentional but could affect patients using download managers or assistive tools.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a meaningful improvement over its predecessor. It includes 39 interactive fillable fields, allowing patients to complete it digitally rather than printing and handwriting. The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient designation → record type selection → sensitive information consent → legal disclosures → signature → contact information. Section headers are bold and labeled, and record type checkboxes (ER, inpatient, outpatient, images, billing) offer useful granularity.

However, several quality issues undercut the form. All 39 fillable fields lack accessible names, creating a significant screen-reader accessibility gap. The form has inflated to 3 pages and 353 KB (with 210 embedded images) compared to the older single-page version covering identical content in 70 KB. The revocation paragraph contains a grammatical error ("affect" instead of "effect") and switches between first and second person mid-sentence, suggesting poorly merged source text. Despite a header instructing patients to "SPECIFY THE DATES OF SERVICE," no field exists for entering dates. The distinction between an "abstract" and a full medical record is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to request the full record.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no witness signature, no in-person submission requirement. Fees are not mentioned at all — neither disclosed nor waived. Revocation rights and re-disclosure warnings are clearly stated. Sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug, mental health, HIV) are appropriately separated per New York State law. The electronic delivery option requires a somewhat confusing two-step process (provide email on the form and send a confirmation email to ROI@montefiorenyack.org), adding unnecessary friction.

## Overall Assessment

Montefiore Nyack Hospital provides a functional, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process. The fillable PDF, multiple submission channels, and electronic delivery option are genuine strengths that place it above many peers. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — funneling self-access requests through a generic third-party authorization form — is the most significant gap. The form's technical quality is further diminished by unnamed fillable fields, grammatical errors, and confusing instructions around dates of service and electronic delivery. The hospital earns a solid **B grade**: accessible and usable, but not designed around the patient self-access use case.

# Canton-Potsdam Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Canton-Potsdam Hospital (CPH) is a community hospital in Potsdam, NY, operated as part of St. Lawrence Health System (SLH), which was acquired by Rochester Regional Health (RRH). Three documents were retrieved — all from the Wayback Machine, as no forms remain on any live website. The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, a blank New York State OCA Official Form No. 960 ("Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA"). The other two documents are a COVID-specific pre-filled version of the same form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Canton-Potsdam Hospital does **not** offer a differentiated pathway for patient self-access. The only authorization form the organization ever published online was the generic NY State OCA-960, which is designed for third-party release of information — not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. A patient requesting their own records would use the same form as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer, needing to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission tool.

Critically, the parent system's Swellbox/Datavant online records request tool **explicitly excludes** St. Lawrence Health facilities, stating: "St. Lawrence Health is not currently available through this application, for information on requesting these records call (315) 769-4386." This leaves phone as the only visible pathway for patients today.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any form for this organization was extremely difficult. The original SLH website (stlawrencehealthsystem.org) now redirects to rochesterregional.org, where CPH-specific content has not been migrated. Multiple web searches returned no downloadable forms. The only successful strategy was the Wayback Machine CDX API, which identified archived PDFs from the defunct SLH domain. A typical patient would have no realistic way to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2.pdf, blank OCA-960) is a digitally produced PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. Its text layer is severely garbled due to font encoding issues, rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers, search, or copy-paste. Despite being created digitally (via PScript5.dll/Acrobat Distiller), no interactive fields were added, requiring patients to print and handwrite responses.

The form is 2 pages: page 1 is the authorization itself with 13 numbered items; page 2 provides instructions. The structure is logical and reasonably organized, covering patient identification, record scope, recipients, purpose, expiration, and signature. However, the language is formal and legalistic, and the form is not pre-populated with any CPH or SLH contact information — patients must know and fill in the correct provider name and HIM department address themselves.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form includes appropriate compliance elements: explicit voluntariness statement, non-conditioning language, right to revoke in writing, and separate initialing for sensitive categories (HIV, substance abuse, mental health) per NY State law. However, the form header includes a Social Security Number field, which creates unnecessary identity theft risk and is not required by HIPAA. No fees are mentioned on the authorization form itself, though the NPP (form-3) does include HIPAA-compliant fee language limiting electronic copy costs to direct labor.

The form does not specify submission methods, delivery format options, or response timelines. No electronic delivery options are mentioned.

## Notable Strengths

- Uses the standardized NY State OCA-960, ensuring baseline legal compliance
- NPP clearly articulates electronic access rights and EHR-based record availability
- Patient-controlled authorization expiration (by date or event)
- Appropriate sensitive-information opt-in with separate initialing requirements

## Notable Weaknesses

- No ROI form available on any live website; patients must call to initiate requests
- Parent system's online records tool explicitly excludes this facility
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party authorization
- Form has zero fillable fields and a garbled, inaccessible text layer
- SSN field on authorization form creates unnecessary risk
- Organization appears stuck in a transitional state between SLH and RRH infrastructure

## Overall Assessment

Canton-Potsdam Hospital presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in this study. The combination of unfindable forms, a phone-only current pathway, no dedicated patient access process, and technically deficient documents creates substantial barriers for patients seeking their own records. The organizational transition from St. Lawrence Health to Rochester Regional Health has left patients in a gap — excluded from the parent system's digital tools but with no local alternative. A patient today would need to call, navigate an uncertain process, and likely complete a paper form designed for third-party release rather than individual access.

# Gritman Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Gritman Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Moscow, Idaho. The organization provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form for all records requests. There is no patient portal–based request option and no dedicated patient access form — patients requesting their own records use the same document as those authorizing release to a third party.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page fillable PDF titled "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (revised 4/1/2024). This form serves both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios, with "RELEASE TO" and "RELEASE FROM" sections on the same document. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), and no patient portal–based request pathway.

The form is linked from the "My Health Records" page on Gritman's website, reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → My Health Records). A web search also surfaces the form quickly. Findability is strong for a small rural hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Gritman does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic HIPAA authorization — a patient requesting their own records fills out the same "RELEASE TO" / "RELEASE FROM" fields as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of the 30-day response requirement, and no guidance distinguishing the patient's stronger legal protections for self-access. The "Purpose" checkboxes include "Personal" as an option, which is the closest the form comes to acknowledging patient self-access, but it carries no special treatment.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **63 fillable fields**, meaning patients can complete it digitally before printing or submitting. It is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient information, release parties, delivery method, purpose, treatment dates, information types, authorization language, and signature. The layout is compact but organized, with clear section headers.

Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legal terminology. The "I UNDERSTAND THAT" section is dense but covers the key compliance elements (revocation, re-disclosure, non-conditioning). The sensitive-information disclosure statement is appropriately specific, listing behavioral health, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing, sickle cell anemia, and substance abuse.

The form offers **five delivery methods**: standard mail, fax, email, pickup, and certified mail. Email availability is a meaningful bright spot — uncommon among small rural facilities. Submission method is less clear: the form header lists a phone number and fax number but does not explicitly instruct patients on how to return the completed form. Patients could reasonably fax it to the listed number.

Field names are absent from the fillable fields, creating an accessibility gap for screen readers. The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Barriers

- **Fees**: The form notes "Continuation of Care (no fee)" for that purpose, implying fees for other purposes including personal requests, but provides no fee schedule or cost estimate. Certified mail carries an unquantified "Add'l Charge."
- **No notarization or witness** required — just patient/guardian signature.
- **No in-person requirement** stated; the fax number in the header provides a reasonable electronic submission pathway.
- **90-day auto-expiration** with a one-year maximum is reasonable.
- **Submission instructions are absent**: No explicit guidance on how to return the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery option** — unusual for a critical access hospital and valuable for rural patients who may live far from the facility.
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific report type checkboxes give patients fine-grained control.
- **"Major Documents for the Last 3 Years"** shortcut — a thoughtful option for patients who don't know exact treatment dates.
- **Recently revised (4/1/2024)** — evidence of active form maintenance.
- **63 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive PDF, not a flat scan.

## Overall Assessment

Gritman Medical Center provides a competent, recently updated, fillable ROI form that is easy to find and reasonably well designed. Its main weakness is the lack of differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — patients are funneled through a generic authorization form that doesn't acknowledge their stronger rights under HIPAA's individual access provisions. Fee transparency is also lacking for personal-use requests. Despite these gaps, the form's fillable fields, email delivery option, and granular record selection make it a serviceable tool for a patient requesting their own records. For a small independent critical access hospital, this represents a solid but not exceptional effort.

# Cone Health — Organizational Synthesis

## Overview

Cone Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Greensboro, NC, operating multiple hospitals and the Cone Health Medical Group (CHMG) physician practices. Four documents were found related to medical records requests: a primary English HIPAA Authorization form (form-1), its Spanish translation (form-2), a Request for Amendment form (form-3, not an ROI form), and a separate CHMG-specific ROI form (form-4) discovered only through web search. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a generic HIPAA authorization downloaded from the Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Differentiation

Cone Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "HIPAA Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-requests and third-party releases. The only differentiation is a checkbox in the Purpose section: "☐ Patient Request ☐ Legal ☐ Other." A patient requesting their own records must still complete recipient fields (name, address, fax, email) designed for third-party disclosures — effectively naming themselves as the recipient of their own information. The form never references the HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or frames the interaction as a patient exercising a legal right. Adding to the confusion, CHMG patients need a separate form (form-4) that isn't linked from the main website, and no guidance explains which form applies to which patient.

## Retrieval Experience

The primary form was **easy to find** — it is linked directly from a well-organized Medical Records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records/`. However, the site employs bot protection that blocks standard HTTP requests, requiring browser-like headers or a real browser for downloads. The CHMG form (form-4) was only discoverable via web search, not through website navigation — a notable findability gap for medical group patients.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields despite being a digitally-produced document (not a scan). All 20+ fields must be completed by hand after printing. This is especially notable because the CHMG form (form-4) includes 42 fillable fields, demonstrating the organization has the capability. The form is organized into 6 numbered sections with a clear logical flow (patient identification → recipient → purpose → facility → date range → information type → delivery method → rights/signature). However, the language is heavily administrative/legal: the Patient Rights section consists of 8 dense paragraphs, and information-type checkboxes use clinical terminology ("History and Physical," "Consultation Reports," "Operative Notes") that most patients would not understand.

The form offers 6 delivery methods including email — a bright spot. But critically, the form provides **no submission instructions** — no address, fax number, email, or guidance on where to send the completed authorization. The only address appears in the revocation clause. A patient must independently determine how to submit.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee charge for reproduction of medical records" with no amounts or reference to HIPAA fee limits. The form bundles authorization for all sensitive categories (reproductive health, mental health, STDs, genetic testing, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS) with no opt-out mechanism — a patient requesting a simple lab result must authorize disclosure of all sensitive information. The "Office Use Only" section requiring a Driver's License number implies in-person identity verification may be expected. The CHMG form compounds these issues with an embedded liability waiver ("hereby released from any legal responsibility or liability") that is not standard HIPAA language and may chill patient access rights.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** (form-2), professionally translated and linked alongside the English version
- **Email delivery option** offered with transparent security disclaimer
- **Granular record-type selection** with 18+ checkboxes including behavioral health subcategories
- **Recently updated** (December 2024), suggesting active form maintenance
- **Amendment form published** alongside ROI forms, appropriately serving the related HIPAA right

## Overall Assessment

Cone Health provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form that was designed primarily for third-party disclosures, with no dedicated pathway for individual access. The primary form's lack of fillable fields, absent submission instructions, bundled sensitive-category consent, and split between hospital and CHMG forms create a process that works but requires persistence and guesswork from patients. The Spanish translation and email delivery option are genuine bright spots, but they don't compensate for the fundamental design choices that make this a C-level experience.

# Alabama Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Alabama Medical Group, P.C. is an independent, for-profit, multi-specialty physician practice based in Mobile, Alabama. The organization maintains a well-organized website with a dedicated Patient Resources section, including a clearly labeled "Request Medical Records" page. Two forms were found and evaluated: a general-purpose "Request for Release of Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a narrow "Permission to Give Medical Information" form (form-2.pdf) for authorizing family phone access. Only form-1 is relevant for a patient seeking their own records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Third-Party Authorization

Alabama Medical Group does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-1, a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form titled "Request for Release of Information." The form is structured around "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" fields — language designed for inter-provider and third-party transfers, not for a patient requesting their own records. A patient would need to place their own name and address in the "Release To" field, which is workable but not intuitive.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access anywhere on the form. The form frames the entire interaction as consent-to-release rather than as an exercise of a legal right. The purpose checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Evaluation & Treatment, Other) further confirm this is designed for third-party scenarios — a patient requesting their own records would likely select "Other" and write in an explanation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The website is well-organized with a clear path: Patient Resources → Medical Records → Request Medical Records. The form is linked directly from that page as a PDF download. The same form also appears on the "Other Patient Forms" page. No bot blocking, no browser fallback needed, and no significant difficulties were encountered. The duplicate hosting (identical file at two URLs uploaded one month apart) is a minor organizational issue but does not impair access.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but **no fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects patient name (including maiden name), date of birth, Social Security Number, medical record number, recipient/source information with address/phone/fax, purpose, type of information (free-text), sensitive information consent, and multiple signature lines. The field count is approximately 15–18 data points.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow and fits on one page, though this density makes it somewhat cramped. Language is a mix of plain English for identification fields and standard legal boilerplate for the authorization terms. The example prompt for specifying record type — "(Example: Office Notes, Labs, In-Office Testing, all records)" — is a helpful touch. The dual signature block for sensitive information consent (specifically permitting vs. specifically not permitting) gives patients clear control.

However, the form lacks submission instructions — no mailing address, fax number, or email address is printed on it. A patient who downloads the PDF would not know how to return it without navigating back to the website or calling the office. There is also no date range field, no delivery format options, and no mention of electronic delivery.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests a Social Security Number as a standard field, which is unnecessary for a medical records request and creates an identity theft risk. The **employee/witness signature line** at the bottom is ambiguous — if required, it would effectively mandate in-person submission, a significant barrier not required by HIPAA. **No fees are mentioned** on the form, which leaves uncertainty about costs. **No response time** is stated.

The form was uploaded in February 2018 and has apparently not been updated since, suggesting the organization has not revisited its records request process in approximately eight years.

## Notable Strengths

- Easy findability with clear website navigation
- Concise one-page form
- Helpful example text for record type specification
- Clean sensitive information consent design with explicit opt-in/opt-out

## Overall Assessment

Alabama Medical Group provides a **functional but dated** records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it funnels patients through a generic third-party release authorization with no acknowledgment of patient access rights. The flat PDF with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no electronic submission pathway creates a primarily paper-based workflow. The SSN collection and ambiguous witness requirement are concerning. This is a practice that has not modernized its records access process to reflect current patient expectations or HIPAA right-of-access principles.

# Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center provides two distinct PDF forms for health information requests, both accessible from a centralized, facility-specific medical records page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/medical-records-wa/sacred-heart`:

1. **Form 1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" — a general third-party authorization form for disclosing records to an external recipient (insurer, attorney, another provider, etc.). 2 pages, 37 fillable fields.
2. **Form 2** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — a dedicated patient access form for individuals requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). 2 pages, 45 fillable fields.

The facility also offers Spanish versions of both forms, plus additional forms for amendments, accounting of disclosures, restriction/revocation, and Health Information Exchange opt-out — a comprehensive suite rarely seen at individual facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release. The dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" form uses correct HIPAA terminology and is purpose-built for patients requesting their own records. This separation is a significant strength — many organizations force patients through a single generic authorization form regardless of whether they want their own records or are authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was effortless. A single web search returned direct links to the facility-specific medical records page. The page is cleanly organized, with clearly labeled PDF download links and no bot blocking, login walls, or portal gatekeeping. URL naming is descriptive (`wa-sacred-heart-access-designated-record-set.pdf`), and the page is reachable through Providence's main navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form 2 — Primary Patient Access Form)

Form 2 is a natively digital 2-page PDF with 45 interactive fillable fields — checkboxes for record types, delivery formats, and text fields for demographics and date ranges. The form is not an image scan. Page 1 provides instructional text and institutional notices; page 2 contains the input fields. The layout is clean and logically organized.

Five delivery format options are offered: MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, and Fax. The MyChart integration is particularly strong, meeting patients where they likely already have an account. Patients can select specific record types, date ranges, and facilities. A "Last 2 years only" convenience checkbox is a practical touch.

The language is reasonably plain, though it includes some boilerplate legal text. The form includes multilingual language assistance notices (English, Spanish, Chinese) with a toll-free phone number and TTY access. Spanish versions of both forms are separately available.

## Barriers

**Signature**: Both forms require a wet signature ("Print form and sign by hand"), which prevents fully digital completion despite the otherwise comprehensive fillable fields. This is the single most significant barrier.

**Fees**: Form 2 states "Fees may be associated with this request" without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based fee standard. Patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by fax ((509) 474-4815), email (PSHMC.HIMRecords@Providence.org), or mail — multiple remote submission options are available, so in-person delivery is not required.

**No notarization** is required. **No response time** is stated.

## Red Flags and Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The patient access form (form 2) includes a liability release clause typically found on third-party authorization forms, which is inappropriate for a patient exercising their Right of Access. The form also lacks any explicit statement of patient rights (right to receive records, 30-day response timeline, right to appeal denial).

**Bright spots**: The dedicated patient access form, five delivery formats including MyChart, multi-facility awareness ("we would be glad to fax a copy of this form to other facilities"), the centralized portal with Spanish translations, and the proactive SSN disclosure warning on form 1 all demonstrate above-average patient-centeredness.

## Overall Assessment

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center offers one of the better patient access experiences among community hospitals. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, five electronic delivery options, and an exceptionally well-organized web portal demonstrate genuine investment in patient-centered records access. The wet signature requirement and vague fee language are the main drawbacks, preventing a top-tier score. The organization earns a strong B overall — clearly above average, with room for improvement in digital workflow completion and rights transparency.

# Medical City Dallas Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Medical City Dallas Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare's Medical City Healthcare division, provides patients with a single system-wide authorization form for requesting health records. The form is available in both English and Spanish as fillable PDFs linked from the hospital's medical records webpage. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients requesting their own records use the same generic HIPAA authorization form designed for all release-of-information scenarios, including third-party disclosures.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were retrieved, both hosted on HCA's digital asset management platform (`hcadam.com`):

- **Form 1** (English): HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21 — "Authorization for Release of PHI (Protected Health Information)." A 1-page fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields.
- **Form 2** (Spanish): HCA-840-00434-S — Direct Spanish translation of Form 1, with identical structure and 52 fillable fields.

Both forms are general-purpose release authorizations. The purpose-of-disclosure field offers "At the request of the individual" as one option alongside "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form does not distinguish between patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) and third-party authorization. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission wizard.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required navigating the hospital website to the medical records page (`/locations/medical-city-dallas-hospital/for-patients/medical-records`). Direct web searches returned stale 404 URLs from a previous hosting location (`medicalcityhealthcare.com/util/forms/`), with no redirects in place. Once on the correct page, the forms are clearly labeled and directly downloadable. No bot blocking or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed, born-digital PDF — not a scan. All 52 fields are interactive and fillable on-screen, eliminating the need for handwriting. The single-page format is efficient but extremely dense: patient demographics, recipient information, four delivery options (paper, electronic media, encrypted email, unencrypted email), 16+ record-type checkboxes, a six-point disclosure statement, psychotherapy notes handling, marketing/sale of PHI questions, and a signature block are all compressed into one page. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — functional for most adults but potentially challenging for low-literacy readers.

The form provides clear section headers (A, B, C) and logically groups related fields. Instructions are implicit in the form structure rather than stated separately. The consent statements correctly cover voluntary authorization, revocation rights, and non-conditioning of treatment — standard HIPAA requirements. The form mentions a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying an amount.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked "(optional)." While optional, collecting SSN on an ROI form is unnecessary for patient identification and creates a data exposure risk.
- **Centralized processing**: All requests go to HCA headquarters in Nashville (PO Box 290789), not to the local hospital. A patient expecting to deal with Medical City Dallas directly may find this confusing.
- **Fax restriction**: Fax delivery is limited to "Physician Office / Medical facility," which could restrict a patient's ability to receive records via fax at a non-medical location.
- **No online submission**: The form must be printed, signed, and mailed or faxed to Nashville. There is no portal-based or email submission option. However, fax submission is available (844-481-0298), meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language version**: A fully translated Spanish form with identical structure and fillable fields, linked with Spanish-language text from the same page — a meaningful accessibility feature for Dallas's large Spanish-speaking population.
- **USCDI release option**: The form includes a forward-looking option for USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release requests, acknowledging modern health data exchange standards. This is rare among ROI forms.
- **52 fillable fields**: Comprehensive digital interactivity means the entire form can be completed on-screen before printing for signature.
- **Four delivery format options**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients genuine choice.

## Overall Assessment

Medical City Dallas Hospital, via its parent HCA Healthcare, provides a technically competent ROI form that is fillable, multilingual, and reasonably well-organized. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — there is no dedicated patient access pathway. The form is a generic authorization that serves all purposes. Findability is hampered by broken legacy URLs, and the centralized Nashville processing model may confuse local patients. The form's document quality is solid (fillable, clear sections, multiple delivery options), but the lack of a patient-centric access pathway and the optional SSN field are notable shortcomings. The organization earns a mid-range assessment: technically adequate with meaningful strengths in multilingual access and digital form quality, but falling short on patient-centeredness and access pathway design.

# Sea Mar Community Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Sea Mar Community Health Centers is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Seattle, WA. The organization publishes a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — that serves as the only downloadable pathway for patients requesting their own records. Sea Mar also offers a patient portal (MyChart) at seamar.org/ohr/index.php, though this was not evaluated as part of the form retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Sea Mar does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios — transfer of care, third-party release, and patient-initiated requests alike. The "Purpose of the release" section includes "At my request" as one option alongside "Transfer of Care" and "Verbal Disclosure," but there is no separate patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no mention of the specific protections that apply to individual access requests (fee limits, format choice, 30-day timeline). A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form that treats their legally-distinct right as just another checkbox on a general authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned a direct link to the PDF on the first attempt, and a site-scoped search confirmed no other ROI forms exist. There was no bot blocking, login wall, or CAPTCHA. The URL (`seamar.org/dl/ROI%20COPY%202022%20PDF.pdf`) uses the acronym "ROI" which patients are unlikely to recognize, but the form was immediately discoverable through search engines. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations make their forms far harder to find.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page PDF with a text layer (not a scanned image), but it has **zero fillable fields**. All entries use underscores and blank lines designed for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and return it — there are no interactive checkboxes, text inputs, or digital signature fields. The form cannot be completed digitally without third-party PDF annotation tools.

The layout is structured with labeled sections on the left side (Patient Information, From, To, Information to be released, etc.) following a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the single-page compression creates density issues with minimal whitespace. The language mixes plain directions with legal terminology — the reference to "Title 42 of the United States code" is imprecise (it should cite 42 CFR Part 2 specifically) and provides no actionable information to patients.

The instruction "Please initial one section" under record types is confusing — there are actually six initialing options, some of which patients might logically want to combine. The "All records" option excludes sensitive information without clearly cross-referencing the separate sensitive information section below, creating a two-step requirement that patients could easily miss.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is the **apparent requirement for in-person submission**. The form lists delivery methods for receiving records (In-Clinic, Verbal, CD, Paper, Fax) but provides no mailing address, fax number, or email address for submitting the completed form. The "Staff Use Only" section — with checkboxes for "Verified all sections are complete" and staff initials — strongly implies the form is designed to be completed in-clinic, in front of staff. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeline is stated. The 90-day default expiration is reasonable for a third-party authorization but conceptually irrelevant for a patient access request, since the right of access is ongoing.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular record type options**: The "Recent summary of care" itemizes specific components (Medication List, Problem List, Progress Notes, Imaging, Immunizations, screening results), giving patients a clear picture of what they'll receive.
- **Minor consent section**: A well-structured section for minors ages 13–17 to authorize release of sensitive information, with age thresholds aligned to Washington State's mature minor doctrine.
- **Easy discoverability**: The form was found on the first search attempt with no access barriers.
- **Patient rights statement**: Present, though generic — covers revocation right and no-conditioning, but does not reference individual access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Sea Mar provides a functional but paper-centric, undifferentiated pathway for patient record access. The form is easy to find online but impossible to complete digitally, and the apparent in-person submission requirement creates a meaningful barrier. The conflation of patient self-access with third-party authorization means patients receive no information about their specific rights under HIPAA's Right of Access. For an FQHC serving diverse communities, the absence of a Spanish-language version and the lack of any digital workflow are notable gaps.

# Pocahontas Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Pocahontas Memorial Hospital (PMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Buckeye, West Virginia. Two PDF forms were found on the hospital's Medical Records page: a general-purpose **Authorization for Release of Medical Information** (form-1, 2 pages) and a narrowly scoped **COVID-19 Testing Authorization** (form-2, 1 page). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own records; form-2 is a pandemic-era authorization for releasing COVID test results to employers or schools.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Form

PMH does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole route for a patient requesting their own records is the generic HIPAA authorization form (form-1), which is designed to handle all release scenarios — personal use, insurance, attorneys, and other third parties. The form does include "Personal use" as the first option under Purpose of Disclosure, and a patient can name themselves as the recipient, but the overall structure (recipient fields, entity authorization, third-party delivery options) is oriented toward release to others. There is no separate patient access request form, online portal, or patient portal–based request workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A general web search for PMH authorization forms returned generic template sites rather than the hospital's own link. A site-scoped search (`site:pmhwv.org`) succeeded, and the form is linked from a logical location: Patients and Visitors > Medical Records. Bot protection on the website blocked direct programmatic (curl) downloads, requiring a browser-based workaround. A patient navigating the website directly would find the form in 2–3 clicks, which is reasonable for a small facility.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring the patient to print and handwrite. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, record type selection (about 10 checkbox options), date range, sensitive information opt-outs, purpose of disclosure, recipient information, and delivery preferences. The logical flow is sensible: patient info → what to release → purpose → recipient → delivery → authorization → signature.

Layout is functional but minimal. There are no bold section headers, boxed regions, or strong visual hierarchy beyond the document title and some capitalized labels. The sensitive information opt-out section is a dense paragraph with inline initial-lines that could be difficult to parse. Language is a mix of plain phrasing and standard legal boilerplate; the authorization paragraph on page 2 is a single dense block. A notable text encoding defect drops the "ti" ligature throughout the PDF (rendering "Patient" as "Pa ent," "authorization" as "authoriza on," etc.), which breaks screen readers and text search — a significant accessibility flaw.

## Submission Methods & Delivery Options

The form offers multiple submission and delivery options: in-person pickup (self or authorized representative), US Mail, fax (304-799-2276), and email. Format options explicitly include Paper and Electronic (email, USB, CD, Portal, other). This is a notably comprehensive set of electronic delivery options for a small critical access hospital. Since fax is available, a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Compliance

**No notarization required** — only a patient signature. The form includes a clear **non-conditioning statement** ("may not condition its providing of health care on whether copies... are released"), an unusual and commendable inclusion for a small rural facility. A **30-day response time** is stated, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Revocation and re-disclosure language are present and standard.

However, the form states **"Photo ID is required"** as a blanket requirement without clarifying whether this applies only to in-person pickup or also to mailed/faxed requests — a potential barrier for remote patients. **Fee disclosure is vague**: "All other requestors are charged as state and federal laws allow" provides no specific amounts, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. These are not dealbreakers but reflect areas where the form could better serve patients.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Electronic format options explicitly listed (email, USB, CD, Portal); multiple delivery methods; non-conditioning statement included; 30-day response time stated; logical form flow.

**Red flags**: Zero fillable fields despite being digitally created; blanket photo ID requirement; vague fee disclosure; systematic text encoding defect affecting accessibility; "Snowshoe Mountain Clinic" listed as a record type alongside clinical categories (confusing).

## Overall Assessment

PMH provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of a small independent critical access hospital. The form is findable, logically organized, and offers commendable delivery flexibility. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, zero fillable fields, and several barrier concerns prevent it from rising above average. The form adequately serves a patient who knows what they need, but it wasn't designed with the patient self-access use case as a priority.

# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Three PDF forms were found for Carle BroMenn Medical Center, a community hospital in Normal, IL that is part of the Carle Health regional system:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary general ROI authorization form specific to the BroMenn/Normal campus (form code X3833-0820). One page. Covers Carle West Physician Group, Carle BroMenn Medical Center, and Carle Eureka Hospital.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A nearly identical system-level Carle Health ROI form for the Champaign campus (form code 174-0319). One page. Same structure but branded for the main Carle campus HIM department.
3. **form-3.pdf** — A behavioral health–specific authorization form for the BroMenn campus (form code X3852-0620). Two pages. Required separately for mental health records per Illinois law.

**Form-1 is the most relevant document** for a patient at Carle BroMenn Medical Center requesting their own general medical records. Form-2 serves the Champaign campus and would likely confuse a BroMenn patient. Form-3 is a companion form needed only for behavioral health records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Carle BroMenn does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" documents designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios. The form uses "To Send to" / "To Request from" framing, requiring patients to navigate a form designed for inter-provider transfers, legal disclosures, and insurance requests. There is no streamlined form or process specifically for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

That said, the form does include some patient-oriented elements: delivery via MyCarle Account (the patient portal), an explicit citation of CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access regulation), and a clear statement that signing is not required for treatment.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches surfaced direct PDF download links on carle.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or multi-step navigation was required. The carle.org medical records page links to the forms. All three were directly downloadable via curl. The only minor friction: a patient might encounter both form-1 (BroMenn-specific) and form-2 (Champaign-specific) without clear guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **digitally-authored but non-fillable PDF**. Despite being created digitally (not a scan), it has zero interactive form fields — every field must be filled by hand after printing. This is a significant missed opportunity. The form is well-organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of release → delivery method → record type selection → legal terms → signature. The granular record-type checkbox grid (30+ categories across hospitalization and clinic columns) gives patients meaningful control over scope. However, the single-page design makes the form cramped, with small font (estimated 8–9pt for legal text) and limited write-in space.

The language is a mix of clear and legalistic. Legal disclaimers are reasonably comprehensible but dense. The "ATTENTION: This is a legal document" warning is somewhat intimidating. There is no plain-language summary.

## Barriers

- **Purpose of disclosure required**: The form requires patients to state why they want their records — a requirement that is potentially non-compliant with HIPAA's Right of Access, which prohibits requiring a reason for patient self-access requests.
- **SSN field not marked optional**: Asks for last 4 digits of SSN without indicating it can be left blank.
- **Paper-only workflow**: No fillable fields, no fax number for submission, no email submission. A patient must print, handwrite, and mail the form or deliver it in person.
- **Behavioral health witness requirement**: Form-3 requires a witness signature for both the authorization and revocation — a barrier not required by HIPAA.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: States "there may be a charge" with no amounts. Form-3 mentions ScanStat as the third-party vendor processing requests.
- **No notarization required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — mail is an option.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyCarle Account electronic delivery** for records (30-day window) provides a digital delivery pathway even though the request itself is paper-based.
- **Explicit HIPAA citation** (CFR 164.524) — uncommon and commendable transparency about patient rights.
- **Granular record-type selection** gives patients fine-grained control over what is released.
- **Easy online findability** of forms with direct download links.
- **Appropriate behavioral health protections** including 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language and age-appropriate consent (12+ for mental health).

## Overall Assessment

Carle BroMenn Medical Center provides a functional but dated records request process. The forms are easy to find and reasonably well-organized, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of electronic submission options, and generic authorization design that doesn't differentiate patient self-access from third-party release hold it back. The purpose-of-disclosure requirement is a compliance concern for patient access requests. The organization earns credit for MyCarle Account delivery, explicit rights citations, and granular scope controls, but the fundamentally paper-based workflow and generic form design place it in the middle of the pack for patient-centeredness.

# Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, a ScionHealth-affiliated for-profit community hospital in Hartsville, SC, offers two publicly available ROI forms: an English "Release of Information Authorization / Requisition Form" (form-1.pdf) and an identical Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are hosted on ScionHealth's CMS infrastructure and linked directly from the hospital's medical records page at cprmc.com/medical-records. No additional patient access forms, online portals, or digital request wizards were found. The hospital uses MRO Corp as its third-party ROI vendor for processing requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms structured around a "disclosing provider → recipient" model. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the "Name of Recipient" section with their own information — a workflow designed for third-party disclosure, not individual access. The form references 45 CFR 160 and 164 only in the context of redisclosure risk and never mentions HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524). There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no simplified self-request form, and no portal-based alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-specific web search immediately surfaced both PDF URLs, and the medical records page provides direct links alongside submission instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, or multi-click navigation was encountered. File names are descriptive (`Authorization_Update_(English).pdf`). This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — but with **zero fillable fields**. Every field must be completed by printing and handwriting. The layout is organized into two sections: Section A for patient and recipient demographics plus record type selection, and Section B for seven legal statements with a signature block. The 15-category record type checklist (face sheet, H&P, labs, imaging, etc.) with an "All Records" option provides good granularity. However, the single-page format forces dense layout with limited whitespace, and the legal statements use moderately complex language referencing CFR provisions. The form lacks instructions beyond section labels, provides no guidance on how patients will receive their records, and includes a "purpose/reason for this request" field without noting that HIPAA does not require patients to justify self-access requests.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable red flags emerge. First, Statement 6 states that patients "may need to have my physician authorize" the use or disclosure of sensitive information in their records — language that could function as an illegitimate barrier to patient access under HIPAA's Right of Access. Second, the "For Office Use Only" section includes a Social Security number field, creating unnecessary data exposure risk. The form discloses no fees, states no response timeline, and does not mention the MRO Corp third-party vendor relationship. On the positive side, no notarization is required, and submission channels include fax and email in addition to in-person delivery — adequate electronic submission options.

## Notable Strengths

The availability of a professionally translated Spanish-language form is a genuine bright spot, particularly for a community hospital. Both language versions are equally accessible from the medical records page. The granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control over their request scope. The easy online findability — direct links, descriptive URLs, no access barriers — represents a model for form availability.

## Overall Assessment

Carolina Pines provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and submit, and the Spanish translation is commendable. However, the lack of any patient self-access differentiation, zero fillable fields, concerning physician-gating language for sensitive records, and absence of fee or timeline transparency place this organization squarely in the middle tier. A patient can navigate this process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Mayers Memorial Hospital District — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were found for Mayers Memorial Hospital District, a government-owned critical access hospital in Fall River Mills, California:

1. **form-2.pdf** — A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" branded with the hospital's name, adapted from the California Hospital Association template (CHA 16-1, March 2013). This is hosted directly on the hospital website but critically mislabeled as "Disclosure of Privacy Practices" in the site navigation. It is the hospital's primary ROI authorization form (form number MMH 470).

2. **form-1.pdf** — A 1-page generic, unbranded "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It was found only through web search and is not linked from any page on the hospital website.

For a patient requesting their own records, **form-2.pdf is the most relevant** — it is the branded hospital form, includes a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose, and contains a substantive "My Rights" section. However, both forms are fundamentally structured as third-party release authorizations.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mayers Memorial does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms require patients to fill in a recipient's name and address, meaning a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own contact information as the "recipient." Form-2 partially acknowledges patient self-access through a "Patient request" checkbox, but the workflow remains identical to a third-party release. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding a usable form was **difficult**. The hospital's Medical Records page provides only department hours and a phone number — no downloadable form, no request instructions. The branded form (form-2) is linked from the Patients & Visitors page under the misleading label "Disclosure of Privacy Practices," a title that describes an entirely different type of document. A patient looking for a records release form would likely skip this link. The generic form-1 is only discoverable through external web search leading to a third-party CDN URL.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-2** (the primary form) is an **image-only scan** with no text layer and no fillable fields. It cannot be searched, copied from, or read by screen readers — a significant accessibility failure. Despite the poor digital format, its content is reasonably well-structured: clear section headers, checkboxes for record scope (all records vs. specific types), granular sensitive-information checkboxes (mental health, HIV, substance abuse) each requiring initials, and a "My Rights" section written in plain first-person language. Estimated field count is approximately 15 fields across 2 pages.

**Form-1** has a text layer (digitally created) but also lacks fillable fields and is far less complete — no checkboxes, no scope options, no rights statement, and no HIPAA-required authorization elements (expiration, revocation).

Neither form provides any submission instructions — no fax number, mailing address, email, or portal link. A patient who completes the form has no documented path to submit it without calling the hospital.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions on either form**: The most critical barrier — patients cannot determine how to return a completed form.
- **Image-only scan** (form-2): Completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.
- **Intimidating opening language** (form-2): "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — potentially chilling for patients who lack details like their MRN.
- **Mislabeled web link**: The form is hidden behind an incorrect label, making it effectively unfindable through normal navigation.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form addresses whether fees will be charged.

## Bright Spots

- The "My Rights" section on form-2 is genuinely well-written in plain first-person language, clearly stating patients' rights to refuse, inspect records, and revoke authorization.
- Sensitive information handling is properly separated with individual checkboxes and initial lines, compliant with California law and 42 CFR Part 2.
- Use of the CHA template ensures baseline legal compliance with California health privacy requirements.

## Overall Assessment

Mayers Memorial provides a below-average patient experience for records access. While the branded form has decent content design rooted in its CHA template, the combination of extremely poor findability, an image-only scan format, absent submission instructions, and no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release creates a frustrating and largely inaccessible process. A patient attempting to request their own records online would struggle at every step — finding the form, reading it with assistive technology, understanding how to complete it for self-access, and figuring out where to submit it.

# University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two versions of the same form were found: **Form 1989 ("ADMIN – Consent to Release of Information and Right of Access Request")**. Form-1 is the current official version (revised May 2024), hosted on the university's healthcare domain. Form-2 is an older revision (August 2021) hosted on a third-party CDN, pre-populated for a driving rehabilitation service ("Safer Driver Solutions"). Form-1 is the canonical, patient-facing document; form-2 is irrelevant for direct patient self-access and is included only for completeness.

The organization directs patients to a clear medical records request page at `uihc.org/medical-records-request`, which links to the PDF form and provides submission instructions. Submission options include email (`him-consentform@uiowa.edu`), fax (two numbers), and physical mail — a notably flexible set of channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form title explicitly names both functions: "Consent to Release of Information **AND** Right of Access Request." This dual-purpose naming is unusual and shows awareness that patients may exercise their HIPAA right of access. However, the form body does not differentiate the two use cases. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no separate workflow, and — critically — no "send records to myself" shortcut. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Send UI Health Care information to" field, effectively treating themselves as a third party. Ironically, the older form-2 included a "Myself at the address above unless noted below" option, which the current revision dropped.

The organization does not distinguish between individual access requests (governed by HIPAA § 164.524) and third-party authorization (governed by § 164.508) in its process or documentation. This is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that acknowledges patient access in name only.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF link. The official medical records page provides clear context and instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, CAPTCHAs, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, natively digital PDF with a clean text layer (4,233 characters). Despite being digitally created, it has **zero fillable fields** — a significant regression from the older form-2, which had 50 fillable fields. Patients must print the form, complete it by hand, scan it, and then submit electronically (email or fax) or by mail. The form's consent language acknowledges electronic completion ("as valid as if you signed the consent in writing"), creating a paradox: the form claims to support electronic completion but provides no interactive fields to enable it.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient → format options → record types → date range → reason → consent → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Sections are spatially separated but lack labeled headers. The language is generally clear, though the consent block contains moderately dense legal prose. Record type options are comprehensive (16+ checkboxes), and the form thoughtfully includes legacy entity lines for patients who received care under prior organizational names (Corridor OB GYN, Mercy Clinics, Mercy Hospital).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states a 30-day response commitment, aligning with HIPAA requirements. The non-conditioning statement is present and properly worded. Fee disclosure is vague: "I understand there may be a charge for this information" — without distinguishing between patient access fees (limited under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. Revocation requires written notification to the Director of Health Information Management, a minor but unnecessary barrier.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Exceptional findability. Multiple electronic submission channels including email. Dual-purpose form title acknowledging right of access. Legacy entity lines accommodating merged organizations. Comprehensive record type selection. Five delivery format options including electronic media (CD, USB, email).

**Red flags**: The current official form regressed from 50 fillable fields to zero — a clear step backward in digital accessibility. The removal of the "Myself" recipient option from the current form makes patient self-access less intuitive than in the older version. Vague fee language fails to inform patients of their right to cost-based fees under HIPAA.

## Overall Assessment

University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics earns credit for excellent findability, multiple submission channels, and a form that at least names patient access in its title. However, the lack of fillable fields on the current form, the absence of a differentiated patient self-access pathway, and the regression from the more interactive older version weigh against it. The organization provides an adequate but not patient-centered experience — a patient can get their records, but must navigate a form designed primarily for third-party authorization using a print-and-fill workflow.

# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Providence St. Vincent Medical Center does not publish facility-specific ROI forms. All record request forms are managed at the parent system level by Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), a major nonprofit health system spanning seven states. Three overlapping forms were found on the Providence HIM page:

1. **Form-1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" (ORC 240A, rev. 03/20): A general-purpose ROI authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Includes a "Self" checkbox but is framed around disclosure to others.
2. **Form-2** — "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" (940507, dated 3/27/25): A dedicated patient access form with updated PSJH branding and R1RCM vendor contact info. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
3. **Form-3** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" (rev. 03/20): An older OR/MT-specific patient access form that form-2 appears to supersede, with outdated PH&S branding and contact information.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence meaningfully distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Form-2 is explicitly titled as a "Patient Request to Access" and defaults to disclosure "to Myself" as the first option. This is a genuine dedicated patient access form — not a generic authorization repurposed with a self-access checkbox. However, the general authorization (form-1) is more easily found via web search, meaning a patient may encounter the less appropriate form first. The HIM page does not clearly guide patients toward form-2 over form-1.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required pivoting from the facility name to the parent system. A search for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center" did not surface ROI forms directly — searchers had to navigate to the system-level HIM page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management`. Once found, this page is comprehensive, listing multiple forms with instructions. However, the presence of three overlapping forms with no clear guidance on which is current creates confusion. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2, the primary patient access form, is a well-constructed digital document. At 3 pages and 72 fillable fields, it is genuinely interactive — patients can complete nearly every field digitally before printing for signature. The layout uses clearly labeled sections (patient information, use and disclosure, record type selection, rights statement, signature) with capitalized headers. Record type options are helpfully tiered: "Pertinent information" (with an explanatory list of common record types) versus "All/Entire Medical Record," plus an "Other" field and "Last two years only" option.

The language is mostly clear, though the title uses the HIPAA term "Designated Record Set" rather than plain-language alternatives. The opening warning — "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — is somewhat intimidating without clarifying which fields are required versus optional.

Five delivery options are offered: MyChart, Paper (Mailed), CD (Mailed), FAX, and Email. Including MyChart is a notable patient-friendly touch. Submission can be made by mail, email (ROIHIMreception@r1rcm.com), or fax — no in-person visit is required.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable barrier is the wet-signature requirement on forms 1 and 3, though form-2 may accept electronic signatures (it lacks the explicit "Print form and sign by hand" instruction found on the others). Fees are disclosed vaguely — "there may be a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access.

A potential red flag appears in form-2's internal "HOSPITAL USE ONLY" section, which includes a physician approval/denial workflow for record release. Under HIPAA § 164.524, denial of patient access is permitted only in narrow circumstances; a blanket physician-approval gate could constitute an unreasonable barrier if applied broadly.

The continued publication of the outdated form-3 alongside form-2, with different contact information and organizational branding, risks sending patients to non-functional channels.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from general third-party authorization
- **72 fillable interactive fields** on the primary form — genuinely digital-first design
- **Five delivery format options** including MyChart and email
- **Multilingual language assistance notices** in English, Spanish, and Chinese
- **Multiple submission channels** (mail, email, fax) with no in-person requirement
- **Comprehensive HIM page** with centralized ROI processing

## Overall Assessment

Providence St. Vincent, through its parent system, provides an above-average patient record request experience. The existence of a dedicated patient access form with strong digital fillability and multiple delivery options demonstrates genuine attention to patient needs. The main weaknesses are findability (requiring navigation from facility to system-level resources), form proliferation without clear versioning guidance, vague fee disclosures, and the physician-approval gate embedded in form-2's workflow. A patient who finds form-2 will have a good experience; the challenge is ensuring they find it.

# St. Charles Redmond — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

St. Charles Redmond is part of the St. Charles Health System, a nonprofit regional system operating four hospitals across Central Oregon (Bend, Redmond, Madras, Prineville). The system uses a single, unified ROI authorization form across all locations — there is no Redmond-specific form. Four PDF documents were retrieved: a legacy 2016 non-fillable version (form-1), a superseded 2022 fillable version (form-2), the current 2025 English fillable version (form-3), and the current 2025 Spanish fillable version (form-4). The primary form for assessment is **form-3.pdf**, the current English authorization form linked from the website.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

St. Charles does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All records requests — whether a patient seeking their own records or a third party requesting disclosure — are routed through the same "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. A patient requesting their own records checks "Personal" under the purpose field, but the form's From/To structure, designed to handle bidirectional provider-to-provider transfers, is unintuitive for simple self-access. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and the form uses an authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than an access-request framework — a meaningful distinction that affects fee limits and processing timelines.

The website's release-of-information page does distinguish between self-requests and third-party requests in its instructions, and notes that patients can alternatively use **MyChart** for records from April 7, 2018 onward. This patient portal pathway offers a fully digital alternative, though it is limited to records after the system's EHR transition date.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the St. Charles ROI page, which is clearly linked under the Patients section. Both English and Spanish PDF links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor issue was that legacy form URLs remain accessible on the server, meaning a search engine could direct patients to an outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a well-constructed 2-page fillable PDF with **65 interactive fields** covering all data-entry points. This is a genuinely usable digital document — patients can type their responses on-screen. The form uses a numbered section system (1–10) with matching instructions at the bottom of each page, a thoughtful design pattern. Record-type options are granular, with parenthetical descriptions explaining what each category includes. Plain-language parentheticals gloss legal concepts (e.g., "revoke (take back or change my mind about)").

However, the layout is dense, and the dual From/To sections (3 and 4) have **identical instruction text**, creating confusion about which section applies to whom. The CORA radiology contact information adds operational clutter. The form collects approximately 15–20 patient-facing fields (demographics, purpose, locations, record types, date range, sensitive-records initials, format/delivery, and signature).

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the **wet-ink signature requirement** — the form explicitly states "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED," preventing electronic signatures and forcing patients to print the form after filling it digitally. The submission pathway then requires faxing (HIM fax number is listed in the footer: 541-706-6352) or mailing to the Bend HIM office. Fax submission is available, satisfying the electronic submission threshold, but the print-sign-fax workflow is cumbersome.

Fees are mentioned twice ("Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations") but never quantified, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. No fee schedule is referenced. The form does not distinguish between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's cost-based limits) and third-party release fees.

No notarization is required. A photo ID check appears in the office-use section but is not presented as a patient-facing barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Full Spanish translation (form-4) with 65 fillable fields — genuinely uncommon and meaningful for Central Oregon's community.
- **Iterative improvement**: The progression from flat PDF (2016) to 64-field fillable (2022) to 65-field fillable (2025) shows active form maintenance.
- **System-wide form with location checkboxes**: Simplifies multi-location requests within the St. Charles system.
- **MyChart alternative**: Provides a fully digital pathway for post-2018 records.

## Overall Assessment

St. Charles Redmond provides a competent but undifferentiated records-request process. The form itself is technically well-made — fillable, bilingual, well-organized — but it funnels patients through a generic authorization framework that wasn't designed for individual access. The wet-ink signature requirement undermines the otherwise digital-friendly form design, and the lack of fee transparency or Right of Access language represents missed opportunities. The MyChart alternative partially compensates but doesn't cover the full record history. Overall, this is a **C-grade** experience: functional and findable, but not patient-centered.

# Scenic Mountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Scenic Mountain Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Big Spring, TX, affiliated with a regional health system. The hospital's medical records page offers two pathways for requesting records: downloadable PDF authorization forms (in English and Spanish) and an electronic request option via a Sharecare/HDS platform. Two PDF forms were retrieved — an English authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are structurally identical general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

The most significant finding is that Scenic Mountain Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. Both PDF forms are titled "Patient Request / Authorization to Use and/or Disclose Protected Health Information," but their structure is that of a standard third-party authorization: Section 2 asks patients to name the recipient ("Person or Facility Name"), requiring a patient requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as both requester and recipient. The "Personal" checkbox under Purpose of Disclosure (Section 8) is the only accommodation for self-access, and there is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. This means patients exercising their individual access rights are funneled through an authorization framework designed for third-party disclosures — a legally distinct process that may result in inappropriate application of authorization-based rules (restricted release signatures, purpose requirements) to what should be a straightforward access request.

The medical records page does mention an electronic request option via a Sharecare/HDS platform, which may provide a more patient-centered digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms do not reflect this differentiation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search for the hospital's medical records release form led directly to the medical records page at `scenicmountainmedical.com/medical-records/`, which provides clear download links for both English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, authentication, or portal login was required. The PDFs are hosted on a secondary WordPress domain (`scenicmountainmedicalcenter.org`), which is slightly confusing from a URL standpoint but transparent to the end user. The page also provides phone and fax contact information.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and return the form. This is a significant missed opportunity: the structured layout with numbered sections, checkboxes, and signature lines would translate well to an interactive PDF.

The form is well-organized with 15 numbered sections following a logical progression: patient identification → recipient → delivery method → date range → record types → restricted release → exclusions → purpose → expiration → legal disclosures → signatures. Section 5 provides 11 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, imaging, discharge summary, etc.) with write-in options, giving patients meaningful control over their request. Section 7 allows patients to exclude specific visits — an uncommon and thoughtful feature.

The legal disclosures on page 2 (Sections 10–13) are dense paragraph-style text that will challenge many readers, but the front-page sections are clear and practical. The bold footer warning — "THIS AUTHORIZATION IS NOT VALID UNLESS ALL APPLICABLE ENTRIES ARE COMPLETED" — could discourage patients who find some sections inapplicable.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form's fee notice ("*fees may apply") is vague, providing no schedule, amounts, or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations for patient access requests. This ambiguity could deter patients. A witness signature line appears next to the patient signature but is not labeled as optional or required — if enforced, this would impose a barrier not required by HIPAA. No notarization is required, and multiple delivery methods (email, postal mail, in-person pickup) are offered. Fax is available for form submission, providing an adequate electronic pathway.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language form**: A fully translated Spanish authorization form is available, appropriately serving the demographics of West Texas. Both language versions are prominently linked on the same page.
- **Email delivery option**: The form includes email as a delivery method — uncommon among facilities and patient-friendly.
- **Granular scope controls**: Patients can select specific record types, specify date ranges, and exclude particular visits.
- **Practical expiration option**: The "until fulfilled" expiration choice is well-suited to one-time patient access requests.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient access differentiation**: The generic authorization framework is the only PDF-based option, conflating two legally distinct HIPAA processes.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form requires printing and handwriting.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: No specifics on costs, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **Translation errors in Spanish form**: A grammatical error in the bold warning text and a duplicate "Ciudad" label where "Estado" should appear undermine the quality of the Spanish version.

## Overall Assessment

Scenic Mountain Medical Center provides an accessible and reasonably well-organized authorization form that is easy to find and available in two languages — a meaningful accommodation for its community. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable PDF format, and vague fee disclosures prevent it from achieving a patient-centered standard. The form serves adequately as a general-purpose authorization but was not designed with the individual patient requesting their own records as the primary use case. **Grade: C (3.30/5.00)**.
