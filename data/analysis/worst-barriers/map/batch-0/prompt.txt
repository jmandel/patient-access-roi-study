You are analyzing ROI form retrieval results for a study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city). Use this to contextualize your findings by org type.

Your task: identify the most significant barriers patients would face when trying to
request their records from organizations in this batch. Look for:
- Difficulty finding the form
- Burdensome requirements imposed on patients
- Poor technical accessibility
- Anything that would frustrate or discourage a patient

Write your findings to "output.md". For each barrier:
- Name the organization and describe the problem
- Explain the impact on patients
- Note whether this seems like an oversight or a pattern

End with a brief summary of barrier patterns across this batch.
Keep to 500-1000 words.

# Decatur County Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Decatur County Hospital (Leon, IA) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in rural Iowa. The facility offers a single authorization form — "Authorization for Access, Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (DCH-#0001) — for all medical records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway; the same generic HIPAA authorization form serves both patients requesting their own records and third-party release scenarios.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form's opening language reads: "I, the undersigned authorize and request Decatur County Hospital to: Allow access, use or disclosure of my protected health information to: OR obtain from:" — presenting patient access and third-party release as two branches of the same document. A patient simply wanting to view or obtain copies of their own records must navigate fields designed for third-party recipients (recipient organization, address, fax number) that are irrelevant to their situation. The form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox, which is the closest it comes to acknowledging individual access rights, but there is no explicit reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524. No patient portal-based records request workflow or online submission mechanism was identified.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. While initial broad web searches failed, a site-scoped search quickly located the PDF linked from the hospital's Patient Portal page. The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0001-Auth-for-Access-Use-or-Disclosure-of-PHI.pdf`) is descriptive, and no bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. For a small rural hospital, the form's online availability is commendable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a genuine bright spot in terms of technical design. Created with Acrobat PDFMaker for Word, it is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 61 AcroForm interactive fields — covering patient demographics, record type checkboxes, purpose options, sensitive-records initials, fee agreement, and signatures. Nearly every blank on the form can be completed electronically without printing. However, AcroForm field names are empty, which would hinder screen reader accessibility.

The form fits everything onto a single page — admirably compact but visually dense. The logical flow is sound (patient identity → recipient → dates → record types → purpose → sensitive records → fees → legal text → signature), but cramming 61 fields, 13 record-type checkboxes, and multiple legal paragraphs onto one page likely challenges readability. The first half uses straightforward language, while the second half descends into dense regulatory prose, particularly the re-disclosure paragraph citing 42 CFR Part 2 and Iowa Code chapters 228 and 141.

Record-type granularity is a strength: patients can select from 13 specific categories (Discharge Summary, H&P, Consultation, Radiology, Progress Notes, OR Report, Pathology, Labs, ER Notes, EKG, PT/OT/ST, Photographs) plus "Other" and a "Review only" option. This gives patients meaningful control over scope.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Social Security Number**: The form requests SSN — unnecessary for patient identification under HIPAA and a significant identity-theft risk on a form that may be faxed or mailed. A medical record number (included as "for office use only") is sufficient.

**Blank fee amount**: The fee disclosure states the hospital "may impose a fee of [blank]" and asks patients to agree to unspecified costs. This prevents patients from making informed decisions about fees before submitting their request.

**No delivery format options**: The form lacks any field for patients to specify how they want to receive records (mail, electronic, in-person). HIPAA § 164.524(c)(2)(i) requires entities to provide records in the form and format requested if readily producible.

**Outdated**: Last reviewed March 2018 — nearly eight years old, predating the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective 2021).

**Binding language**: The statement that authorization provisions "take precedence over statements made in the Decatur County Hospital's Notice of Privacy Practices" is potentially misleading, suggesting patients might be waiving protections.

## Strengths

The form includes an explicit conditioning prohibition (treatment will not be conditioned on signing), clear revocation instructions with a mailing address, and appropriate separate-initials requirements for sensitive records (substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS) under applicable federal and state law. The comprehensive record-type granularity and digital-first fillable design are notable positives.

## Overall Assessment

Decatur County Hospital provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records access. The fillable PDF is technically sound, but the generic authorization approach, SSN collection, blank fee amount, outdated review date, and absence of delivery format options collectively place this facility below the standard patients should expect for exercising their individual access rights.

# Ben Taub Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ben Taub Hospital is a government-owned community hospital in Houston, TX, part of the **Harris Health System**. It uses system-level forms for medical records requests — both downloaded PDFs are branded Harris Health documents, not Ben Taub–specific materials.

## Forms & Pathways

Two forms were retrieved. **Form-1** ("Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information") is the sole relevant document for a patient seeking their own records. **Form-2** is a marketing/media authorization unrelated to patient record access. Only form-1 is assessed below.

The medical records page at harrishealth.org clearly explains the request process and offers four submission channels: **mail, fax, email, and in-person drop-off**. Contact details — including phone (346-426-0980), fax (346-426-0959), and a dedicated email (Releaseofinformation@harrishealth.org) — are printed directly on the form. A patient can fill the form digitally and submit via fax or email without visiting the facility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Harris Health uses a **single dual-purpose authorization form** for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form handles this well through conditional sections: the "Purpose of Request/Disclosure" and "Expiration" sections are explicitly marked as "only required if the individual providing this authorization form to Harris Health is someone other than the patient." This means patients can skip irrelevant sections without needing a separate form. It is not a dedicated patient access form, but it clearly accommodates patient self-access as a first-class use case.

The email delivery option is labeled "Email Address (Patients Only)," further demonstrating that patient access is specifically considered in the form's design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and it is directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or rendering issues were encountered. The PDF URL is descriptive and identifiable in search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **65 interactive form fields** — a strong digital-first design. However, the fields lack programmatic names, reducing accessibility for screen readers and auto-fill. The form covers patient identification, recipient details, facility selection (with Ben Taub specifically listed), 14+ record type checkboxes, format options (paper, CD, email), sensitive information consent, and signature blocks — all on one page.

The layout is **dense but logically organized**, flowing from patient info → recipient → records scope → format → purpose → expiration → signatures. Section headers are minimal, and the cramped single-page layout sacrifices visual clarity for compactness. Language is moderately clear, leaning toward legal/administrative phrasing, but includes a well-worded non-conditioning statement. The form was recently revised (December 2024), suggesting active document management.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization is required and no fees are mentioned. Multiple submission channels are available. One notable concern: the form includes a **witness signature line** without clarifying whether a witness is truly required or who qualifies. This could be a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.

The form's footer includes an **internal intranet URL** (apps.hchd.local) — inaccessible to patients and a document-control oversight. The fillable fields lack programmatic names, an accessibility deficiency.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery explicitly for patients** — the "Patients Only" label on the email option is a meaningful patient-access accommodation
- **Conditional sections** that let patients skip third-party–only fields
- **Granular record type selection** with 14+ categories and proper psychotherapy notes separation
- **Multiple submission channels** with contact details printed on the form
- **Dedicated authorization withdrawal email** (AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org)

## Overall Assessment

Ben Taub Hospital, through Harris Health System, provides a **competent, accessible records request process**. The form is findable, fillable, and submittable electronically. While it uses a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, it thoughtfully accommodates patient self-access through conditional sections and patient-specific features like email delivery. The witness signature ambiguity and unnamed form fields are the primary weaknesses. Overall, this represents a solid B-level experience — functional and reasonably patient-friendly, with room for improvement in form clarity and dedicated patient access design.

# Cherokee Health Systems (River Valley Health) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cherokee Health Systems, now rebranded as **River Valley Health**, is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The organization provides a well-organized suite of four PDF documents for medical records requests, available on a dedicated Medical Records page at rvh.org. The suite consists of the primary English ROI authorization form, a Spanish translation, and color-coded instructional guides in both languages — a standout accessibility feature that few organizations match.

## Forms and Pathways

All four documents are variants of a single general-purpose **"Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Health Records"** form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form distinct from the third-party release authorization. The form is bidirectional — it can be used to request records from an external provider or to authorize River Valley Health to send records elsewhere. A "Personal Use" checkbox is included among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Record Requested to be Sent From" and "Record to be Sent To" facility sections) assumes an inter-facility transfer model. A patient wanting a copy of their own records must awkwardly fit themselves into the "Record to be Sent To" facility section.

Submission is available via **email** (registration@rvh.org) or **in person**. No fax number for submission is listed on the forms or in the notes, though the form collects fax numbers for the sending/receiving facilities. The email pathway means patients can submit without a physical visit, which is a meaningful accessibility advantage.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which is also accessible via the main website navigation (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records). All four PDFs are prominently linked with clear labels and descriptive filenames. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot protection blocking direct programmatic downloads — a hosting infrastructure issue, not an intentional barrier. The page includes contextual submission instructions alongside the download links.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — despite being born-digital and recently updated (December 2025), the form was designed for print-and-handwrite completion. A patient must print, fill by hand, scan or photograph, and email the result. This is a meaningful accessibility gap for a 2025-era document.

The layout is logically organized with clear section headers: patient information, sending facility, receiving facility, record type checkboxes, purpose checkboxes, and a signature block. The upper portion is clean and self-explanatory. The lower portion contains two dense legal paragraphs — a sensitive information disclosure notice (appropriately citing 42 C.F.R. Part 2 and HIPAA) and a certification block that packs six signer categories into a single run-on sentence. The certification text is challenging for a typical patient to parse.

The **color-coded instructional guides** (forms 3 and 4) are a genuine bright spot. They overlay plain-language annotations explaining each section ("Enter your personal information in this section," "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider"), effectively translating bureaucratic form headers into understandable instructions. This paired approach — plain form plus annotated guide — is uncommon and genuinely helpful.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no fee disclosure (meaning no upfront fee barrier, though patients are also not informed of costs). The authorization expires after 12 months, and revocation rights are clearly stated.

The form does **not** reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), does not include a patient rights statement, and does not state a response timeframe. These are missed opportunities but not violations.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: The bilingual form suite with instructional companions is exceptional. Providing annotated guides in both English and Spanish demonstrates genuine commitment to patient comprehension and language accessibility — this goes well beyond the typical approach of offering a bare authorization form. The forms are recently updated (December 2025), indicating active maintenance. Email submission availability removes the in-person barrier.

**Weaknesses**: The absence of fillable fields in a born-digital 2025 PDF is a notable gap. The form's generic ROI authorization design does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a bidirectional facility-routing model when they simply want their own records. The Spanish version contains minor translation errors (CRF vs. CFR, missing closing parenthesis).

## Overall Assessment

Cherokee Health Systems earns a **B grade** overall. The organization clearly invested in patient communication — the bilingual instructional guides are a model other organizations should emulate. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the form wasn't designed with that use case front-of-mind.

# Valleywise Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valleywise Health Medical Center, a government-owned independent community hospital in Phoenix, AZ, provides a notably patient-centered approach to medical records access. The organization maintains two distinct PDF forms: a general third-party authorization (Form 43439) and a dedicated patient access request form (Form 45643). This two-form architecture is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement, clearly separating patient self-access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Valleywise Health is among the organizations that get this right. Form 45643 — "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — is explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It does not require the patient to name a third-party recipient, does not include a purpose/reason field, and does not carry an expiration clause — all appropriate design choices for a one-time patient access request. Meanwhile, Form 43439 handles third-party disclosures with the appropriate authorization infrastructure (recipient designation, purpose selection, expiration, revocation rights). The organizational intent to differentiate is clear and well-executed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` returned direct PDF URLs. The organization's patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` also links to the forms. Both PDFs were publicly accessible from a standard WordPress media directory with no bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication. The descriptive filenames (e.g., `Form-45643-Patient-Request-For-Access-To-Protected-Health-Information_ENG_SPA.pdf`) make it clear which form is which.

## Form Document Quality

Form 45643 is a 2-page bilingual PDF (English page 1, full Spanish translation page 2). The layout is clean with a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection → date range → delivery format → recipient information → processing details → signature. The form offers an impressively granular record type selection with 16+ specific categories (discharge summary, H&P, nursing notes, operative reports, pathology, radiology, etc.) plus an "All Records" option. Delivery options include MyChart patient portal, paper copy, CD, USB, email, and fax.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a digitally-authored document. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the form's clean layout would translate well to interactive PDF fields. Submission is available via fax (602-655-9017) and email (ROI@valleywisehealth.org), providing adequate electronic pathways, but the print-and-handwrite step creates friction in an otherwise well-designed process.

The language is plain and accessible throughout, with clear instructions ("Please check (✔) the appropriate box(es) (❑) and fill in the blank(s) as needed") and a patient-friendly tone ("We appreciate your patience while we process your request").

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization, witness, or in-person requirements exist. The form states a HIPAA-compliant 30-day response timeline with a possible 30-day extension. Fee disclosure is vague — "Valleywise Health may charge a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing a fee schedule, though the language about "actual cost of the portable media" aligns with HIPAA's cost-based limits.

Two concerns stand out. First, the form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient access requests and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed or emailed. Second, the Spanish translation references "documento 43780" instead of the correct Form 43439, potentially sending Spanish-speaking patients searching for a nonexistent form.

## Notable Strengths

The standout features are the **full bilingual (English/Spanish) form** — not a summary but a complete parallel translation, appropriate for Phoenix's demographics — the **dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release, and the **granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control over their request scope. The email encryption transparency, defaulting to encryption with an informed opt-out, is a thoughtful touch.

## Overall Assessment

Valleywise Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its medical records access process. The dedicated patient access form, bilingual design, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options reflect genuine attention to the patient experience. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a paper-first completion workflow despite otherwise modern design sensibilities. The SSN field and Spanish-version cross-reference error are notable but secondary concerns. This is a well-designed system with room for straightforward technical improvements.

# The Valley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

The Valley Hospital is a nonprofit, independent community hospital in Paramus, NJ, operating under the Valley Health System umbrella alongside Valley Medical Group (VMG) and Valley Home Care. Four PDF authorization forms were found — two VMG versions (July 2023 and May 2023), one older hospital-specific form hosted on MRO Corp's site (last revised 2011), and one Valley Home Care form (April 2023). Critically, the hospital's medical records page now directs patients to an online records request tool with identity verification via driver's license photo, rather than linking to any downloadable PDF forms.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is the **online records request tool** accessible from the medical records page at `valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`. This represents a meaningful shift toward patient-centered digital access — the identity verification via driver's license photo suggests a workflow specifically designed for the patient themselves, distinct from third-party release scenarios.

The PDF forms, by contrast, are all **generic HIPAA authorization forms** designed for release of information to any recipient. None is a dedicated patient access form. The most current form (form-1, VMG, July 2023) accommodates patient self-access through instructions that say "If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF'" — functional but clearly an afterthought within a third-party disclosure framework. The four forms create a confusing landscape: a patient of The Valley Hospital proper might not realize the VMG form is what they need for ambulatory records, while a separate home care form exists for Valley Home Care patients. No guidance on the website explains which form applies to which entity.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the online records request tool is straightforward — the medical records page sits at a logical URL in the patient resources section. Finding the PDF forms, however, requires search engine assistance. The medical records page no longer links to any downloadable PDFs. The forms remain hosted at their original URLs on valleyhealth.com (and on mrocorp.com for the older hospital form) but are effectively orphaned. A patient who specifically wants a PDF form would need to search externally — not an unreasonable ask, but not ideal either.

## Form Document Quality

The best PDF form (form-1, VMG July 2023) is a well-structured 2-page document with a clear Section A/Section B organization and a full second page of step-by-step instructions with practical examples. The instructions are genuinely helpful — explaining how to designate self-access, offering example expiration events, and warning about unencrypted email risks. However, **none of the four forms has any fillable/interactive PDF fields** (all have `fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being born-digital documents with clean text layers, they are designed purely for print-and-fill workflow. The form offers five delivery methods — fax, paper copy, CD, unencrypted email, and encrypted email — a strong set of options. The encrypted email option is a positive differentiator.

The language is mixed: the instructions page uses plain language, but the sensitive information consent section is dense. The form's handling of sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance use, reproductive health) includes important NJ-specific protections but is complex enough to confuse lay readers. Approximately 20–25 fields must be completed, which is reasonable for a records authorization.

## Barriers

**Misleading "entire record" checkbox**: Checking "Entire medical record" on form-1 will *exclude* Behavioral Health Specialist and Substance Use Specialist records unless those boxes are also separately checked. This is the most significant red flag — a patient checking "entire record" would reasonably expect completeness.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "there may be a fee" based on page count but discloses no amounts. The older hospital form (form-3) explicitly states a $1/page fee for personal use, which may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access. Fees are processed through MRO Disclosure Management Solutions, a third-party vendor.

**No form submission instructions**: Form-1 tells patients what to fill out but never specifies where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email for submission. Only the revocation address is provided.

**No notarization or witness required** on the primary form (form-1), though the older hospital form (form-3) includes a witness line.

## Bright Spots

- **Online portal transition**: The org has moved its primary pathway to a digital records request tool, significantly improving access over PDF-only workflows.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: Offering encrypted email alongside standard options demonstrates privacy awareness.
- **Comprehensive instructions**: The full-page plain-language instruction sheet with practical examples is among the better guidance we've seen.
- **Five delivery methods**: Fax, paper, CD, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients meaningful choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

The Valley Hospital earns a **B grade** primarily because of its transition to an online records request portal, which places it ahead of organizations still relying solely on paper forms. The PDF forms themselves are adequate but generic — they serve third-party release as the primary use case and accommodate patient self-access as a secondary scenario. The absence of fillable fields on all four PDFs is a missed opportunity for born-digital documents. The misleading "entire record" exclusion and fee ambiguity are notable compliance concerns, though neither rises to the level of an active barrier to access. The organization's investment in an online portal signals a patient-centered direction, even as its legacy PDF forms lag behind.

# Huntington Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Huntington Hospital, a community hospital in Huntington, NY, is part of the Northwell Health system and uses Northwell's system-wide forms for all records requests. Four documents were retrieved: a general third-party Authorization for Release of Health Information (form-1) with companion instructions (form-2), and a dedicated patient-specific Request for Access form (form-3) with its own companion instructions (form-4). The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-3**, the "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative."

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Access Form

Northwell Health distinguishes itself by maintaining **two separate form types**: one for third-party release (form-1) and one specifically for patient self-access (form-3). This two-form architecture is uncommon among healthcare organizations and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to HIPAA compliance. Form-3 opens with an explicit citation of HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524, informing patients of their right of access, and presents "To me" as the first recipient option — signaling that patient self-access is the primary use case, not an afterthought.

However, there is a notable gap: form-1 (the third-party release form) contains **no cross-reference** to form-3. A patient who encounters the general authorization first would have no indication that a separate, more appropriate form exists for their self-access request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. All four documents are directly linked from the Northwell Health medical records page at northwell.edu. The main friction point was search disambiguation — "Huntington Hospital" also refers to a facility in California, requiring "Northwell" to be added to queries. No facility-specific forms exist at huntington.northwell.edu; patients must navigate to the parent system site. URLs are descriptive (e.g., `request-for-access-to-health-information-form-english-2022.pdf`), and the filename's "english" suffix hints at a multilingual intent, though no non-English versions were found during retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a strong document. At **2 pages with 28 fillable fields**, it is a genuinely interactive PDF that patients can complete digitally without printing. The layout follows a logical numbered structure: patient demographics, source facility, recipient, delivery method/format matrix, record type selection, substance use/HIV consent section, and signature block. The delivery options are notably comprehensive — mail, facility pickup, secure email, unsecure email (with explicit risk acknowledgment), fax, USB flash drive, and CD.

The language is generally accessible, using informal parenthetical labels like "(From Who)" that prioritize clarity over grammatical precision. The companion instruction document (form-4) provides step-by-step guidance with concrete examples ("Jane Patient," "Dr. Jane Jones at 300 Northwell Drive"), which is a genuine accessibility aid.

The form does have minor weaknesses: the delivery method matrix with nested checkboxes requires careful reading, and the witness signature line is ambiguous — it doesn't state whether a witness is required or optional, which could create a perceived barrier.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and does not mandate in-person submission. The expiration field applies only to substance use disorder and HIV records (consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 and NY law), not to the general access request — a correct implementation. No fees are disclosed, which avoids discouragement but leaves patients without cost visibility.

The most significant gap is the **absence of submission instructions**. Neither form-3 nor its instructions (form-4) specify where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link is provided. A patient could fill out the form perfectly and still not know what to do with it. This is a systemic gap across all four Northwell documents.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation — rare among healthcare organizations
- **28 fillable fields** enabling fully digital completion
- **Companion instruction documents** with annotated visual examples — genuinely helpful and uncommon
- **Comprehensive delivery format options** including USB flash drive and secure/unsecure email with informed consent

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No submission instructions** on any form or instruction document
- **No cross-reference** between the third-party form (form-1) and patient access form (form-3)
- **Witness line ambiguity** may deter patients who assume a witness is mandatory
- **Third-party form (form-1) lacks fillable fields** despite patient access form having 28 — inconsistent modernization

## Overall Assessment

Huntington Hospital, through its parent system Northwell Health, provides an above-average patient access experience. The dedicated patient access form with HIPAA citation, fillable fields, comprehensive delivery options, and companion instructions represent genuine investment in patient-centered design. The primary gaps — missing submission instructions and lack of cross-referencing between forms — are meaningful but do not fundamentally obstruct access. This organization earns a **B grade**, reflecting strong patient-centeredness and good document quality with room for improvement in workflow completeness.

# OrthoCarolina — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

OrthoCarolina, an independent for-profit orthopedic practice in Charlotte, NC, offers a single generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests — whether the patient is requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party. Three versions of this form (dated 2017, 2020, and 2023) remain simultaneously available at different URLs on the organization's website. The most current version (form-1, revised 04/2023) is the primary form linked from the medical records resource page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

OrthoCarolina does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All requests flow through the same "Authorization for Access/Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under Purpose of Release, which at least signals that patient self-requests are a recognized use case. However, the mandatory recipient section ("This information is to be disclosed to the following individual or entity (MUST BE COMPLETED)") forces patients requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as the disclosure target — a design that treats self-access as just another flavor of third-party release rather than a distinct right under HIPAA § 164.524.

The form makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access, does not explain patient rights to receive records within 30 days, and does not distinguish the fee structure for patient access (which must be reasonable and cost-based) from third-party release fees.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned both the direct PDF link and OrthoCarolina's medical records resource page. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or browser fallback was needed — forms downloaded cleanly via direct URL. The main findability concern is version confusion: three nearly identical forms exist at three different public URLs with no version indicators in the filenames, no redirects from old URLs, and different fax numbers across versions (the 2017 form lists a different fax number). A patient who finds form-2 via a search engine could submit to the wrong fax number.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised as recently as April 2023, it uses underscored blank lines throughout, requiring patients to print and handwrite. A patient determined to complete it digitally would need third-party PDF annotation tools — a workaround, not a designed workflow.

The layout is dense but follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → records requested → radiology images → recipient → purpose → fee notice → delivery method → sensitive information consent → signature. However, the single-page constraint leads to cramped formatting, and the delivery method section has a known layout defect where authorization expiration language overlaps with delivery checkboxes, producing garbled text in the PDF's text layer (problematic for screen readers).

The language is mostly plain, though the sensitive-information consent and revocation clauses run together in a single dense paragraph. The newer form-1 dropped the prominent "YOU MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION" notice that appeared in both older versions — a regression in patient-rights transparency.

## Submission & Delivery

OrthoCarolina offers notably comprehensive submission and delivery options. The form can be submitted via mail, email (OrthoCarolinaMedRec@orthocarolina.com), fax, or patient portal upload. For record delivery, seven options are available: patient portal upload, email (for both records and radiology images), fax, paper mail, CD mail, and in-person pickup. This breadth — particularly the inclusion of email submission and patient portal delivery — is a genuine strength for a physician practice.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness is required. In-person delivery is not mandated. Fees are mentioned but not quantified: "Medical record copy fees are determined by both the nature/purpose of your request and the format/method of delivery." This vagueness, combined with no distinction between patient-access and third-party-release fee structures, creates a risk of overcharging for Right of Access requests. The form also includes a broad liability waiver releasing OrthoCarolina from "any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure" — standard boilerplate but potentially intimidating.

## Overall Assessment

OrthoCarolina earns credit for easy form findability, multiple submission/delivery channels (including email and portal), and a reasonably organized single-page form. However, the lack of any dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields in a 2023-vintage PDF, vague fee language, and the liability waiver embedded in a records request form collectively pull the assessment down. The organization treats patient self-access as undifferentiated from third-party release, missing an opportunity to acknowledge and streamline the exercise of a fundamental HIPAA right. The result is a serviceable but uninspired experience that a patient can navigate — but that was not designed with them in mind.

# Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital (Richmond, VA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital is part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system and uses system-wide forms for its Richmond-area facilities. Two PDF forms were found: an English-language "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" (form-1.pdf, BSR-MR-50, rev. 1/21) and a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2.pdf, BSR-MR-50SPN, rev. 11/17). Both are single-page, non-fillable PDFs linked directly from the system's medical records page. Beyond the PDF forms, Bon Secours also offers an online request pathway via Ciox/Swellbox and MyChart patient portal access, giving patients three distinct channels to request records.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

The PDF form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for third-party disclosure — the structure asks the patient to authorize a facility "TO DISCLOSE" information to a named recipient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly name themselves as both authorizer and recipient, navigating a form whose conceptual framework doesn't match their use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form.

That said, the form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an "eDelivery by Ciox (for patient's only)" delivery option specifically marked as patient-exclusive. These suggest some awareness of the patient self-access use case, but the form itself was not redesigned around it. The availability of Ciox/Swellbox as an online portal likely represents a more patient-centered pathway, though it was not evaluated in detail as it is a web-based tool rather than a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately surfaced the Bon Secours medical records page at `bonsecours.com/patient-resources/request-medical-records`, where both PDF forms are directly linked alongside information about online and MyChart options. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The URL path (`roi-form-2017.ashx`) is somewhat opaque but the page itself is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (form-1.pdf) is a digitally-authored, single-page PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. The layout is compact and logically ordered: demographics → record types → recipient → delivery format → purpose → legal terms → signature. The top half uses clear, short labels; the bottom half shifts to dense legal language across four numbered paragraphs. Twelve record-type checkboxes plus two "Other" fields provide good scope granularity. Five delivery format options (US Mail, CD/DVD, Radiology Film/CD, MyChart, Ciox eDelivery) are notably generous.

The Spanish version mirrors the English form but lags by over three years (November 2017 vs. January 2021), contains several untranslated English field labels ("Anesthesia Record," "Radiology Film/CD"), and has a minor typographical error (double closing parenthesis). While the existence of a Spanish form is commendable, the version discrepancy raises concerns about whether Spanish-speaking patients receive equivalent information.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees are vaguely stated**: "copying charges will be applied, according to the hospital policy" — with no specific amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) and third-party release fees. This is a compliance concern.
- **No response time stated** on the form.
- **Fax submission is available** (fax number listed in notes: 804-673-9561), so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multilingual availability**: English and Spanish forms linked from the same page — better than most organizations.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Five options including MyChart and Ciox eDelivery with email, going well beyond the typical mail-or-fax binary.
- **Multiple request channels**: PDF form, Ciox/Swellbox online portal, and MyChart portal give patients real choice.
- **Single-page efficiency**: All necessary content on one page reduces patient burden.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference**: The form cites the HIPAA Right of Access provision, which is uncommon and helpful.

## Weaknesses

- **Generic disclosure form, not patient-access form**: The form is conceptually designed for third-party release, forcing patients to adapt.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form lacks any interactive fields — a missed opportunity.
- **Vague fee language**: No fee schedule, no patient-access fee distinction.
- **Spanish version outdated**: Three-year lag behind English version with untranslated fields.

## Overall Assessment

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The form is easy to find, compact, and offers unusually good delivery options including electronic delivery for patients. The multilingual availability and multiple request channels (PDF, Swellbox, MyChart) are genuine strengths. However, the core PDF form remains a generic third-party authorization that doesn't center the patient self-access use case, it lacks fillable fields, and its fee language falls short of HIPAA transparency standards. The overall experience is adequate but not exemplary — a patient can get their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary user.

# Erie Family Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erie Family Health Centers, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Chicago, provides two downloaded ROI forms: an English version (form-1.pdf) and a Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are identical in structure — a single-page "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form. The organization also directs patients to MyChart (myeriehealth.com) as the primary records access pathway, referenced on a dedicated medical records request page at `/recordsrequest/`.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Erie does **not** offer a dedicated patient-access form. Both downloaded forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for bidirectional use: releasing records *to* a third party or receiving records *from* a third party. A patient requesting their own records must select "to Release to" and write their own name and address in the recipient fields — a process designed for inter-provider transfers, not individual access. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under the purpose section, which accommodates self-requests but does not differentiate the pathway. There is no separate, simplified form for patients exercising their Right of Access under § 164.524.

That said, the records request page promotes MyChart as the primary way to access records, which provides a true patient-access pathway. The PDF form functions as a secondary or fallback option.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search for "Erie Family Health Centers medical records release form PDF" returned the direct URL. The organization maintains a clearly labeled `/recordsrequest/` page that links both English and Spanish PDFs and also promotes MyChart. No bot blocking, login walls, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with **54 fillable fields**. It was designed for digital completion, not a scan. However, field names are not programmatically labeled (empty `fillable_field_names` array), which impairs screen reader accessibility. The layout is logically organized — patient identification, authorization direction, purpose, format, delivery method, record types, date range, sensitive-category permissions, rights statement, and signature — all on one dense page.

The language is reasonably clear for an authorization form, though the legal disclaimers at the bottom (addressing re-disclosure restrictions under Illinois mental health, substance abuse, and AIDS confidentiality laws) are dense and directed at the receiving party rather than the patient. The reference to "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" is cryptic — no pay scale is provided or linked, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs.

Format options include paper copy or "Electronic copy (CD-ROM)" — the CD-ROM reference is outdated. Delivery methods include encrypted email, pickup at an Erie facility, fax, and US postal mail. Encrypted email is a notable modern inclusion.

## Barriers

- **Copy of ID required** as a blanket requirement, with no alternative verification methods offered. For an FQHC serving populations that may lack government-issued ID, this exceeds what HIPAA mandates for identity verification.
- **Witness signature line** present with no indication of whether it is required or optional, potentially creating an unnecessary procedural barrier.
- **Fee opacity**: "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" references an undisclosed fee schedule. Patients cannot learn costs before submitting.
- **No notarization** required. No in-person submission requirement. Auto-expiration at six months is reasonable.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both English and Spanish versions are provided and linked side-by-side — appropriate and commendable for a Chicago FQHC.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: A modern, patient-friendly option that many organizations omit.
- **Dedicated records request page**: Clear `/recordsrequest/` page contextualizes forms and promotes MyChart as an alternative.
- **Granular record selection**: Nine specific record categories plus "Other" let patients request exactly what they need.
- **MyChart availability**: The patient portal provides a true digital-first access pathway beyond the PDF form.

## Overall Assessment

Erie Family Health Centers earns a **B grade** (3.70 weighted score). The organization makes its forms easy to find, offers bilingual versions, provides a fillable PDF with modern delivery options including encrypted email, and maintains a dedicated records page. These are genuine strengths, especially for an independent FQHC. However, the lack of a dedicated patient-access pathway (funneling all requestors through a generic third-party authorization form), the undisclosed fee schedule, the blanket ID copy requirement, and the ambiguous witness signature line prevent a higher score. The MyChart portal partially compensates by offering patients a true self-service pathway, but the PDF form itself — the focus of this evaluation — treats patient self-access as just another use case rather than a first-class right.

# Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center (VGMHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Hillsboro, Oregon, serving a predominantly Latino patient population. The organization publishes four Release of Information–related documents on its website: the main HIPAA ROI authorization form in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), plus a Release of Verbal Health Information form in English (form-3) and Spanish (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records is form-1 (or form-2 for Spanish speakers).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

VGMHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. A patient wanting their own records must use the same general-purpose HIPAA Release of Information form designed for inter-provider exchanges and third-party releases. The form asks the patient to choose a direction ("Get information," "Give information," or "Get and give information") and specify a recipient provider/facility — a workflow that doesn't map cleanly to "I want a copy of my own records."

A partial mitigation exists: the form includes "For my own use" as a purpose checkbox alongside "Coordination of care" and "Insurance/Legal." This acknowledges patient self-access as a valid use case, but the patient still must navigate a form structured around bilateral information exchange rather than simple record retrieval. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal–based records request option visible on the website.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately returned direct links to the English ROI form, and the organization's Patient Forms page (https://virginiagarcia.org/get-care/patient-forms/) has a clearly labeled "Release of Information Forms" section grouping all four documents. The only friction points were technical: PDF links are embedded in Divi theme JavaScript click handlers rather than standard HTML anchor tags, and the initial Spanish PDF URL found via search returned an error page (the working URL differed by one character in the filename). Neither issue would meaningfully impede a typical patient clicking through the website.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English ROI form (form-1) is a **well-constructed, fillable interactive PDF** — a 2-page document with 54 interactive form fields, a full text layer, and clean digital typography. It was clearly born-digital, not a scan. The form follows a logical structure: patient identification → direction of release → recipient details → purpose and frequency → granular record type selection (9+ categories plus 4 sensitive-information opt-ins) → legal disclosures → signature block → staff-only section.

The language is mostly **plain and accessible**. The rights section clearly states patients don't need to sign to receive treatment, provides a 30-day processing timeline, and offers two concrete revocation pathways. One minor grammatical error exists ("If have not received your records" — missing "you").

A notable accessibility gap: all 54 fillable fields **lack accessible names** (`fillable_field_names: []`), meaning screen readers cannot identify what each field is for. This is a significant deficiency for an otherwise well-designed digital form.

## Barriers and Compliance

VGMHC imposes **no illegitimate barriers**. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, no witness signature needed, and no fees mentioned. The form header provides both a fax number (503-357-4371) and a PO Box address, enabling remote submission. The 30-day processing commitment aligns with HIPAA requirements.

One concern is the **open-ended authorization duration** — the form defaults to remaining in effect "until my care ends with Virginia Garcia," which could mean years or decades for a patient in an ongoing care relationship. While the patient can specify a different date, the default is unusually long compared to typical 1-year expirations.

The form does not explicitly cite the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or frame patient record requests as a distinct legal entitlement — it treats all authorization types equivalently under a general HIPAA authorization framework.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both the main ROI form and the verbal release form are available in full English and Spanish versions — not bilingual addenda, but complete standalone translations. For an FQHC serving a predominantly Spanish-speaking community, this is a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Granular record selection**: Patients can choose specific record types (progress notes with date range, immunizations, labs, dental, medications, imaging, consultations) rather than an all-or-nothing approach, with separate opt-ins for sensitive categories.
- **Active document governance**: Version numbering (v6), effective/revision dates, and department ownership (Compliance) demonstrate ongoing form maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Virginia Garcia earns a solid **B grade**. The organization makes its forms easy to find, provides a technically capable fillable PDF, offers meaningful bilingual access, and imposes no illegitimate barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway — a patient requesting their own records must navigate a generic authorization form designed for third-party releases. The form accommodates patient access (via the "For my own use" checkbox) but doesn't prioritize it. For an independent FQHC without portal infrastructure, this is a common pattern, and VGMHC handles it better than many peers thanks to its well-designed form documents and strong language accessibility.

# Esse Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Esse Health is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in St. Louis, Missouri. Two documents were retrieved from their patient forms page: an Authorization for Release of Medical Information (form-1.pdf) and a communication/message authorization (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own health records. Notably, Esse Health also offers a DocuSign-based electronic submission pathway for the same ROI form, which meaningfully improves the overall patient experience.

## Access Pathway

Esse Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single ROI form (form-1.pdf) is a generic HIPAA authorization with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED BY" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields — a structure designed for records transfers between providers or releases to attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no separate section for individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient requesting their own records has different rights than a third party requesting records on someone's behalf.

The form does cite 45 CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA right of access provision), which is a positive signal, but this is buried in a dense paragraph of legal language rather than presented as guidance for patients. The availability of a DocuSign electronic submission option is a genuine bright spot — it allows patients to complete and submit the form digitally without printing, scanning, or visiting the office.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF URL, and the patient forms page at `essehealth.com/patient-center/patient-forms/` is well-organized with clear labeling under "General Forms." No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The retrieval was rated **easy**. One minor issue: the communication authorization form (form-2) has "Medical Records" in its website title, which could mislead a patient looking for the actual records release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF. While the metadata reports 28 fillable field annotations, the field names array is empty, suggesting the fields may not be properly configured for interactive use. The form relies on underline blanks — it was designed primarily as a print-and-write document. However, the DocuSign alternative compensates significantly by providing a fully interactive digital pathway.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, release from/to fields, 11 record-type checkboxes, sensitive information disclosure, revocation and expiration language, and signature. The language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese — the opening authorization statement is clear, but the disclosure paragraphs covering HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse are denser. At one page, the form is appropriately concise without being cramped.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment. It provides a six-month default expiration and a revocation mechanism, though the revocation language ("present my written cancellation to the health information management department") is ambiguous about whether this can be done remotely. Fee disclosure is vague — "there may be a charge associated with copying my health information" — with no specifics about amounts or HIPAA's cost-based limits. No delivery format options (electronic, paper, mail, pick-up) are mentioned, which is a gap for patient self-access scenarios. Submission options include the DocuSign electronic pathway, making electronic submission available.

## Overall Assessment

Esse Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The key strength is the DocuSign electronic submission option, which elevates the experience above many peers by enabling end-to-end digital completion and submission. The key weakness is the lack of any differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — the generic authorization form forces patients to navigate a process not designed for them. The form itself is clean and concise but not interactive, and the fee disclosure is vague. For an independent physician practice, this represents a middle-of-the-road effort: the form is easy to find and usable, but the organization has not invested in a patient-centered access pathway.

# Synthesis: Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix

## Overview

Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix is part of Banner Health, a major nonprofit health system in the western United States. The facility uses Banner Health's system-wide forms for medical records release rather than maintaining its own. Two forms were found: a current system-wide authorization (form-1.pdf, revised 06/2025) and a legacy hospital-specific version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/2017). The current system-wide form is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Banner Health offers two pathways for record access: a downloadable PDF authorization form and a patient portal (Banner Health App / https://account.bannerhealth.com/). The current form (form-1.pdf) prominently notes at the top that patients can access most health information through the portal, which is a helpful redirect before a patient commits to the paper process. For records not available through the portal, the PDF form is the primary pathway. Submission options include mail, fax, and in-person pick-up — fax provides an adequate electronic submission method, though there is no online form submission or email-based submission option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Banner Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" documents designed to cover all release scenarios. The current form includes a "Self" checkbox under both the "Release/Send Information To" field and the "Purpose" field, acknowledging that patients may request their own records, but the form structure, language, and authorization requirements are identical regardless of who the records are going to. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same release-from/release-to paradigm, date range fields, record type checkboxes, and HIPAA authorization language that a third party would face. There is no simplified patient access request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A straightforward web search returned the system-wide form immediately, and it is published on bannerhealth.com under the patients/medical-records section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA was encountered. Both forms were directly downloadable via curl. The coexistence of the current (2025) and legacy (2017) forms on the same website creates a minor risk that patients might download the outdated version, which lacks the portal callout and has less granular sensitive-information controls.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a flat, non-fillable PDF — zero interactive form fields despite being a born-digital document. A patient must print the form, handwrite all fields, sign it, and submit via mail, fax, or in-person. The form is 2 pages with approximately 20 fields to complete (patient demographics, release from/to addresses, date range, record type checkboxes, delivery preference, purpose, and signature). The layout is logically organized with clear section headers and a natural top-to-bottom flow. Record-type selection is granular with 12 specific categories plus an "Other" option.

Language is mixed: the opening paragraph about "third-party directives" is dense regulatory jargon that would confuse most patients, but the authorization statements on page 2 use accessible "I understand" framing. The sensitive information section uses an exclusion model — all sensitive data is included by default, with checkboxes to opt specific categories out. This is more protective than the legacy form's blanket consent but may still surprise patients who don't realize they must affirmatively opt out.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: The form warns "There may be a FEE associated with your Request for Records" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access fees (capped under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. This vagueness may deter patients from making requests.

**Liability waiver**: The form includes a broad release of Banner Health from "any legal responsibility or liability for the disclosure" — a clause that goes beyond standard HIPAA authorization requirements.

**No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature (or legal representative), which is appropriate.

**No in-person requirement**: Fax submission is available, so patients are not forced to visit the facility.

## Strengths

- **Patient portal callout**: The prominent opening line directing patients to the portal is a best practice that may eliminate the need for the paper form entirely for many patients.
- **Recent revision**: The 06/2025 revision date demonstrates active form maintenance.
- **Granular record selection**: 12 specific record categories give patients meaningful control.
- **Sensitive information opt-out**: Per-category exclusion checkboxes improve on the blanket consent approach.
- **Clear patient rights language**: Explicit statements about the right to refuse, non-conditioning of treatment, and right to revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Banner Health provides a findable, recently maintained, and reasonably well-designed authorization form, but it falls short of a truly patient-centered experience. The form funnels all requests — self-access and third-party — through the same generic authorization, the PDF is not fillable, and the fee disclosure is vague. The patient portal redirect is a genuine bright spot, but for patients who need the paper form, the experience is a standard paper-based workflow with no digital-first innovation. The organization earns credit for accessibility and active maintenance but loses ground on technical modernization and pathway differentiation.

# Penobscot Community Health Care — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Bangor, Maine. Two PDF forms were found, but they are identical documents hosted at different WordPress upload paths (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf share the same text, revision date, and form code MRC001). The organization's primary records request pathway is a third-party Datavant/Swellbox online portal, linked from the Health Information Management page. The PDF authorization form exists on the server but is not linked from any patient-facing page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

PCHC does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. The sole PDF form is titled "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" and covers both disclosing records TO a third party and obtaining records FROM a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the same form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties — including naming themselves as the recipient and navigating redisclosure warnings that don't apply to self-access. The purpose checkbox "At my request" is available but does not clearly distinguish individual access rights from authorized third-party release.

The Datavant/Swellbox portal (https://www.swellbox.com/pchc-wizard.html) is the pathway the organization actively directs patients toward from its website. While this provides a digital alternative, the PDF form — the only org-created document available for evaluation — remains a generic HIPAA authorization with no patient access specialization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted Google search (`filetype:pdf` query); it was **not discoverable** through normal website navigation. The HIM page (https://pchc.com/healthinformation/) links to the Datavant portal and a Privacy Practices Booklet, but not the authorization form PDF. Two identical copies at different URLs (`/2024/03/` and `/2021/11/` paths) create version-control confusion. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. Difficulty: moderate — the portal is findable from the website, but the PDF form is effectively hidden.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive fields) across 2 pages. Patients must print it, handwrite all entries, and submit physically. Despite the non-fillable format, the document itself is well-structured with clear, labeled sections progressing logically: patient identification → authorization direction → recipient details → delivery method → record types → sensitive information → purpose → duration → rights acknowledgments → signature. Approximately 18 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology. Core instructions ("To DISCLOSE my health information below TO:") are clear with helpful capitalization for emphasis, but several sections use dense legal prose. The "continuing communications" clause and opt-out-by-striking mechanisms are particularly confusing — patients must physically strike out text to limit scope, and failure to do so defaults to the broadest possible authorization, including ongoing disclosure of future encounters.

Record type granularity is good, offering seven specific categories plus an open-ended option, with date-range filtering. Four delivery methods are available: mail (defaulting to CD), fax, email via secure portal, and verbal communication.

## Barriers and Compliance

No fees are disclosed — neither excessive charges nor explicit statements of no-fee patient access. No notarization or witness is required. The form does not specify submission instructions, though PCHC's fax number (207-990-1248), mailing address, and email (PCHCMR@pchc.com) are provided in the header, implying fax and mail submission are available.

Compliance elements are generally sound: oral revocation is permitted, the non-conditioning statement is present, 42 CFR Part 2 redisclosure notice is properly included, and sensitive information categories require affirmative opt-in. However, the form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or reference the patient's right of access. The office-use section includes an unusual and commendable accountability checkbox requiring staff to flag partial or incomplete disclosures.

## Bright Spots

- **Secure email delivery** via PCHC's portal (records sent as PDFs accessible through a secure messaging system)
- **Oral revocation** permitted — more accessible than written-only requirements
- **Partial disclosure transparency** — internal checkbox requiring notification when records provided are incomplete
- **Datavant/Swellbox portal** provides an alternative digital pathway beyond the paper form

## Red Flags

- **PDF form is unlinkable from the website** — HIM page directs exclusively to Datavant, making the org's own form effectively hidden
- **Opt-out-by-striking defaults** to broadest possible authorization for continuing communications and third-party-received records
- **CD as default mail delivery** medium — outdated and likely unusable for many patients

## Overall Assessment

PCHC provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The organization deserves credit for offering a Datavant portal as a digital pathway and for several thoughtful compliance provisions. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access form, the non-fillable PDF, the hidden form URL, and the confusing opt-out defaults limit patient-centeredness. A patient navigating PCHC's website would be funneled to the Datavant portal — a workable option — but would struggle to find or use the organization's own authorization form independently.

# Sturdy Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Sturdy Memorial Hospital (Attleboro, MA) publishes two PDF authorization forms on its website, both titled "Authorization to Release Health Information." Form-1 (updated January 2025, form code SM00081 10/24) is the current, actively maintained version — a 2-page fillable PDF with 59 interactive fields. Form-2 is an older (~2017) legacy version of the same document with zero fillable fields, outdated terminology ("Venereal Disease"), and defunct department references. Form-2 remains publicly accessible, creating a risk that patients download the wrong version. There is no redirect, banner, or other mechanism steering patients to the current form.

No online portal, patient portal integration, or third-party vendor (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was identified for records requests. The only documented pathway is downloading and completing the PDF authorization form, then submitting it — presumably by mail or fax, though the form itself does not specify a submission method. The hospital's mailing address (211 Park Street, PO Box 2963, Attleboro, MA 02703-0963) is listed in the revocation instructions.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Sturdy Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both form versions are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms structured around a three-party model: the patient authorizes Provider A to release records to Provider B. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in the "Release of Protected Health Information To" field — an unintuitive workaround that the form does not explain. The "Purpose of Disclosure" checkboxes include "Personal," the closest match for self-access, but this option is neither highlighted nor explained. The form does not reference the patient's HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), nor does it mention the right to inspect or obtain copies of one's own records as a distinct use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search immediately surfaced both PDFs as direct links on sturdyhealth.org. No website navigation was needed. However, Akamai CDN bot protection blocked programmatic downloads (curl returned "Access Denied"), requiring a browser-based JavaScript workaround to retrieve the raw PDF bytes. This would not affect a typical patient using a web browser but could impede assistive-technology or API-based access.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

The current form is a standout in technical execution. With 59 fillable fields, it is comprehensively interactive — patients can complete the entire form electronically without printing. The PDF is a native digital document (no scanned images, full text layer, 221 KB file size). The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → authorization source/recipient → sensitive information categories → purpose of disclosure → record types → rights → signature. The form uses clear section organization across its 2 pages.

Language is mixed: the rights section uses accessible plain English ("I may refuse to sign this authorization and that such refusal will not affect my health care"), while the sensitive information and disclosure sections are more legalistic. No plain-language summary or introductory guidance is provided. The form is English-only.

Record-type granularity is a notable strength — approximately 14 categories with individual date-range fields (medical record abstract, clinic visit notes, emergency room, lab reports, radiology, pathology, operative reports, etc.), giving patients meaningful control over scope. Sensitive information categories (mental health, HIV/AIDS, STD, sexual assault, substance abuse, genetic testing) require individual initials, respecting Massachusetts law and patient autonomy.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **90-day hard expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signature, with no option to specify a custom date (the older form-2 allowed this). Given HIPAA's 30-day processing window with a possible 30-day extension, this leaves a narrow margin.
- **Ambiguous witness requirement**: A "WITNESS" line appears at the bottom of page 2 with no instructions on whether a witness is required. Patients may unnecessarily delay submission while seeking a witness.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs for records copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No electronic delivery option**: No checkbox for email, portal, or electronic format delivery of the requested records.

## Bright Spots

- **59 fillable fields** — exceptional among ROI forms, most of which have zero interactive fields. Clearly a deliberate digital-first design decision.
- **Granular record-type selection** with ~14 categories and date ranges.
- **Individual sensitive-information consent** via initials for each category.
- **Active form maintenance** — the January 2025 update shows ongoing attention.
- **No notarization requirement**, no consent bundling, and clear right-to-refuse language.

## Overall Assessment

Sturdy Memorial Hospital delivers a technically excellent form that falls short on patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF with granular record selection is among the best form documents in its class, but the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway means patients must navigate a third-party release form to exercise their Right of Access. The form's structure, language, and field design all orient toward provider-to-provider or provider-to-insurer disclosure rather than patient self-access. Combined with ambiguities around witness requirements, submission methods, and a restrictive expiration, the experience is functional but not patient-centered.

# Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola is a community hospital in the Florida panhandle, part of the Ascension health system — one of the largest nonprofit Catholic health systems in the United States. The facility uses Ascension's market-specific forms for the Florida panhandle region rather than purely facility-level documents. Two PDF forms were found during retrieval, along with references to a Swellbox-powered online records request portal and an Ascension patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Most Relevant Form

Three pathways exist for patients requesting their own records:

1. **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary): The facility's medical records page directs patients to a Swellbox-powered online request wizard — a third-party vendor platform purpose-built for patient record requests. This is the org's preferred channel.
2. **PDF authorization form (form-1.pdf)**: A traditional single-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Information From Ascension Sacred Heart," form number FFM99-8700-010-00 (rev 8/20). This is the general-purpose ROI form covering four Ascension Sacred Heart facilities in the Florida panhandle.
3. **Ascension patient portal**: The medical records page also references the patient portal for direct record access.

A second PDF (form-2.pdf) was found but is irrelevant for patient self-access — it is a department-specific inbound records release for the Radiation Oncology department, designed for transferring records *from* other providers *to* Sacred Heart. It uses outdated "Sacred Heart Health System" branding, contains multiple typos, and dates from 2016.

**Form-1 is the most relevant downloadable document** for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does not offer a dedicated patient-access PDF form distinct from third-party authorization. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed to cover all release scenarios — patients, insurers, attorneys, and other third parties all use the same document. A patient requesting their own records must check the "Patient Named Above" box to indicate they are both the patient and recipient, and select "At the request of the patient" as the purpose. This works but requires the patient to navigate a form designed for a broader audience.

However, the Swellbox online portal serves as a de facto dedicated patient access pathway. Online records request wizards are specifically designed for patient-initiated requests, providing a more guided experience than the generic PDF form. The existence of this portal partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient-access PDF.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. The primary PDF was discovered on the first web search using standard ROI-related keywords and downloaded without any bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or browser fallback requirements. The form is hosted on Ascension's content delivery system at a stable, descriptive URL. However, a patient navigating the website organically would be directed to the Swellbox portal rather than the PDF — the downloadable form is available but not prominently linked from the website's navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

**Technical format**: The PDF has a text layer (not a scan) but zero fillable/interactive fields. All blanks are underscores — patients must print and handwrite. Despite being digitally authored with 7 embedded fonts, it was designed entirely for a print-and-fill workflow.

**Layout and organization**: The single-page form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient information → purpose → format preference → report type checkboxes → facility/date selection → sensitive information authorization → legal disclosures → signature. The checkbox layout for report types and facility selection is clean and practical.

**Language**: The upper portion uses reasonably plain language. The lower third shifts to dense legal text — the sensitive information authorization bundles HIV, AIDS, psychiatric conditions, substance abuse, sickle cell anemia, STDs, and hepatitis into a single all-or-nothing binary decision in one long sentence. The revocation rights section runs together without paragraph breaks.

**Instructions**: Minimal. There are no instructions for how or where to submit the completed form. A note warns: "If you fail to specify which records you desire, you will only receive a copy of the discharge summary" — defaulting to minimal disclosure when patients don't navigate the checkbox list correctly.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number as a standard field — unnecessary for patient access and creates identity theft risk.
- **Purpose marked "REQUIRED"**: HIPAA does not require patients to state a reason for accessing their own records, though the pre-printed "At the request of the patient" option reduces the practical burden.
- **Default to minimal records**: The discharge-summary-only default if record types aren't specified may result in patients receiving less than they're entitled to.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. Patients have no advance notice of potential fees.
- **Internal EHR navigation paths visible**: Staff-facing filing instructions appear in the form footer, suggesting the document wasn't reviewed for patient-facing use.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox online portal as primary pathway**: Directing patients to a dedicated digital request wizard is a significant positive.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: One form covers four Ascension Sacred Heart locations — patients with care across facilities don't need separate forms.
- **Electronic format option**: The form offers a choice between electronic and paper delivery, though "electronic" is undefined.
- **Concise single-page design**: All content fits on one page without excessive cramming.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola provides a **mixed but functional** experience. The organization's strength lies in offering a Swellbox online portal as the primary pathway — a genuinely patient-centered digital option. However, the fallback PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, unnecessary SSN collection, and no submission instructions. The form is easy to find but was clearly designed for institutional workflow rather than patient self-service. A patient who uses the Swellbox portal will likely have a reasonable experience; one who downloads the PDF will face a traditional print-and-mail workflow with some compliance concerns.

# UW Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UW Medical Center, part of the UW Medicine system (University of Washington), provides a single ROI form for all of its facilities: "Patient Authorization to Disclose, Release, and/or Obtain Protected Health Information" (form U0626, version V.2512, last approved December 2025). This 3-page fillable PDF covers Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center (Montlake and Northwest campuses), UW Medicine Primary Care, and UW Physicians. No separate patient-access-specific form exists — this is a generic HIPAA authorization serving both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UW Medicine does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from third-party authorization. The single form handles all release scenarios — attorneys, providers, insurers, and patients alike. The "Purpose of Request" section includes a "Personal" checkbox, and the "Recipient of Records" field lists "Patient" as one example alongside "Insurance Company, Attorney, Physician." A patient can certainly use this form, but the framing treats self-access as one option among many rather than a first-class use case.

However, UW Medicine partially compensates with an outstanding **MyChart fast-track**: the form opens with a prominent callout — *"Recent medical records are available via MyChart for immediate download without filling out this form"* — and page 3 elaborates with instructions and a URL. The form also notes that an electronic request form is available within MyChart as an alternative. This effectively creates a two-tier system: MyChart for recent records (instant, self-service), and the paper authorization for everything else.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. Web searches for UW Medical Center ROI terms immediately surfaced it, and the UW Medicine website's Patient Forms page links directly to the canonical URL on the UW compliance site (`depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf`). One complication: the uwmedicine.org CDN blocks programmatic downloads (403 errors), but since the official patient forms page links to the compliance-hosted version, patients following the normal path encounter no issues. No browser fallback was needed for the working URL.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-designed interactive PDF with **61 fillable fields**, a full text layer, and 10 embedded fonts — clearly a digital-first document, not a scan. The layout follows a logical **numbered structure** (Items #1–7): patient information, purpose, facility selection, recipient, record types, format preferences, and expiration. This is easy to follow and a patient could complete it without assistance.

**Language** is mostly plain and accessible, though the patient rights section on page 2 includes a dense legal paragraph about conditioning treatment on authorization that would challenge many readers. Page 3 provides item-by-item **completion instructions** — an unusual and genuinely helpful addition that sets this form apart.

**Delivery format options** are exceptional: CD/DVD, Paper, MyChart, USB/Thumb Drive, and Email — five choices, more than nearly any other provider form. **Submission channels** are equally strong: postal mail, fax ((206) 744-9997), and email (uwmedroi@uw.edu), with separate contacts for billing records.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. There is **no notarization or witness requirement**, no in-person submission mandate, and no fee disclosure on the form (neither a stated fee nor a stated exemption). The 3-year default authorization expiration is generous. Revocation requires a written request to the Compliance Office — standard but could be more accessible.

One ambiguity: the form includes a blanket statement that the authorization "permits UW Medicine to release information related to sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, behavioral or mental health services, and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse," which could confuse patients about whether signing automatically releases all sensitive categories.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart fast-track** at the top of the form actively diverts patients to faster self-service
- **Five delivery formats** give patients genuine choice
- **Three submission channels** (mail, fax, email) with complete contact information
- **Instruction page** with item-by-item guidance and honest expectations about record completeness
- **Multi-facility coverage** via a single form with clear facility checkboxes
- **Sensitive information opt-in model** for specific unit records (sexual assault, mental health, living donor)

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access form — generic authorization serves all purposes
- No mention of HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or fee limits for patient access
- "PLACE PATIENT LABEL HERE" hospital artifact may confuse patients filling out at home
- Fillable field names are empty in metadata, potentially indicating accessibility deficiencies for screen readers

## Overall Assessment

UW Medical Center provides a **competent, well-designed generic authorization form** with strong digital capabilities and multiple submission options. The MyChart promotion is a standout patient-centering feature that partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway. The form's thorough instruction page, granular record selection, and five delivery formats demonstrate genuine care for usability. The main gap is structural: patients requesting their own records navigate the same form designed for attorneys and insurers, with no acknowledgment that their rights and fee protections differ. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and mostly patient-friendly, but not designed around patient self-access as a primary use case.

# Rhode Island Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rhode Island Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Providence, RI, is part of the Brown University Health system (formerly Lifespan). Two PDF forms were retrieved: a system-wide "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" form (form-1, updated October 2024) and a department-specific imaging-records release form (form-2, Lifespan Medical Imaging, revised February 2023). Form-1 is the primary form relevant to a patient requesting their own records from Rhode Island Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Rhode Island Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both retrieved forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. The primary form (form-1) frames the workflow around disclosing records *to* a named recipient ("To release to:"), which is the structure of a third-party authorization — not a patient self-access request. While the form does include "Patient Request" as a purpose checkbox (Section 4), a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in their own name as both the patient and the recipient. There is no separate form, section, or process that recognizes individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 as distinct from authorized disclosure to third parties.

The hospital does maintain a dedicated medical records request webpage at `brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records` with contact information, which is a helpful navigation aid. However, this page directs patients to the same generic authorization form rather than offering a simplified patient-access workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the primary form, and a site-specific search confirmed the URL and identified the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or other access barriers were encountered. The PDF was directly downloadable from a public URL. This is a strong point — many organizations make form discovery far more difficult.

## Form Document Quality

**Fillability**: The primary form is a born-digital PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being a recently updated document (October 2024), patients must print it and complete all fields by hand. This is a missed opportunity given the form's digital origin — adding interactive fields would be trivial.

**Layout and organization**: Form-1 uses a logical 11-section numbered structure covering facility selection, recipient, dates, purpose, format, record types, exclusions, and legal terms — all compressed onto a single page. The structure is clear, but the density is high, with legal boilerplate competing for space with patient-facing fields.

**Language**: The legal sections (8–11) use standard but dense regulatory language. No plain-language summary, explanatory guidance, or patient-friendly instructions are provided. A patient without familiarity with HIPAA authorization forms would likely find the legal sections intimidating.

**Record format options**: Limited to "paper" or "CD disc" — no electronic delivery option (email, portal, secure link) is offered. This is notable for a 2024 form, especially given HIPAA's requirement to provide records in the electronic format requested if readily producible.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Broad liability waiver**: Section 9 requires patients to "release Brown University Health, its employees and my physicians from all liability arising from this disclosure of my health information." Bundling a blanket liability release into a records authorization is aggressive and may discourage patients from exercising their access rights.
- **Vague fee language**: The form notes "There may be a fee associated with this request" without specifying amounts, providing a fee schedule, or distinguishing between patient-access fees (HIPAA-capped) and third-party release fees.
- **No electronic delivery**: Offering only paper and CD in 2024 creates a barrier for patients seeking digital access.
- **Out-of-state contact numbers**: Status inquiry numbers route to Massachusetts and California area codes, suggesting outsourced ROI processing — potentially confusing for Providence-based patients.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record-type selection**: ~10 specific record categories plus a behavioral health subsection, with a helpful "Abstract" definition footnote, give patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.
- **Sensitive information protections**: Five categories of sensitive information (sexual abuse, mental health, STIs, substance use, HIV) can be excluded, respecting both 42 CFR Part 2 and Rhode Island state law.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: A single form covers all Brown University Health facilities with clear checkboxes, avoiding the need to locate separate forms.
- **Easy findability**: Forms are prominently available online with no access barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Rhode Island Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and logically organized, but it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual access rights — through a generic third-party authorization workflow. The absence of fillable fields, electronic delivery options, and a patient-access-specific pathway places it squarely in the middle of the pack. The embedded liability waiver and vague fee language are concerning, though the granular record-type options and sensitive-information protections are commendable. A patient can successfully request records, but the process was clearly designed for institutional disclosure workflows rather than patient self-service.

# U.S. Dermatology Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides a single ROI form — "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — available as a one-page PDF from their Patient Forms page. Two copies were found online: form-1.pdf (uploaded March 2020, currently linked) and form-2.pdf (uploaded June 2019, orphaned but still publicly accessible). Both contain identical text, with a revision footer of "Rev 08/2017," indicating the content has not been substantively updated in nearly nine years. For patient self-access purposes, form-1.pdf is the relevant document.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Instead, it uses a generic HIPAA authorization form that bundles patient self-access with third-party release scenarios. "Patient Access" appears as one checkbox among five under "Purpose of Use/Disclosure," alongside "To Doctor," "To Insurance," "To Attorney," and "Other." The overall framing — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure" — is oriented toward third-party release, and a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form structure designed for a different purpose. For example, the recipient section asks for "Name of individual or organization" and its address, which is confusing when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" surfaced the PDF directly, and the Patient Forms page at `usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/` has a clearly labeled "Medical Records Release" link. No bot blocking, login wall, or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields** (`fillable_field_count: 0`), requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and physically sign. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow with clear sections for patient identification, disclosure direction, delivery method, purpose, date range, record types, and rights disclosures. Language is somewhat legalistic but generally readable. The form lacks instructions on where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is provided.

## Delivery and Submission

The form lists three delivery options for records: mailed, faxed, or electronic (patient portal only). However, these describe how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself is *submitted*. The form is silent on submission method, leaving patients without guidance. Given the lack of submission instructions and the non-fillable PDF, the workflow is effectively: download → print → hand-fill → unknown submission. The patient forms page and general website would likely require calling the office to determine where to send it; fax is presumably available once the patient contacts the office.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions**: The most significant usability gap. A patient who completes the form has no idea where to send it.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure," bundled into the authorization with no opt-out. This is overreaching for patient self-access requests.
- **Vague fee language**: "A reasonable fee may be charged for the records" does not distinguish patient-access requests (HIPAA-limited) from third-party releases, and gives no indication of actual costs.
- **Typo**: "IDS" instead of "AIDS" in the sensitive information disclosure — uncorrected since 2017.
- **No response time commitment**: No mention of turnaround time or the 30-day HIPAA requirement.
- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive fields despite being a digitally created PDF.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: The entire authorization fits on one page without being cramped — a respectful use of patient time.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment" is unambiguous and well-placed.
- **Easy online findability**: Directly linked from a well-organized Patient Forms page with clear labeling.
- **Patient rights disclosures**: Five bullet points covering right to a copy, right to inspect, right to revoke, voluntariness, and sensitive information notice.

## Overall Assessment

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides an easily findable, concise ROI form that technically accommodates patient self-access through a checkbox — but the form is fundamentally a third-party authorization repurposed for all disclosure scenarios. The lack of fillable fields, missing submission instructions, bundled liability waiver, and vague fee language collectively create a paper-era experience with notable friction points. The form has not been meaningfully updated since 2017. A patient can likely get their records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Grady Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's major public safety-net hospital operating under Grady Health System, provides patients with a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Three PDF documents were found: a current authorization form (form-1, revised 2/22), an older superseded version (form-2, revised 5/15), and a combined instructions-plus-form package (form-3, bundling the older form with a COVID-era cover page). None of these forms are tailored specifically for patient self-access — all are structured as "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information," framing the process as a release between two parties rather than an individual exercising their right of access.

## Access Pathway

Grady does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting someone else's records. All requesters use the same authorization form with identical "Request Information From" / "Release Information To" fields. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively addressing the form to themselves. The form does include "Personal" as a purpose option, and the documentation requirements section on page 2 distinguishes "Patients Requesting Their Own Medical Records" from third-party requests — but this distinction lives in the supporting text, not in the form design itself. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the main authorization form and the medical records page at gradyhealth.org/medical-records/. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without login, bot blocking, or broken links. The medical records page provides clear context for the forms. This earns high marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the current primary form, is a 2-page digitally-created PDF with a text layer and clean layout. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. For a digitally-created document with 12 embedded fonts, this is a missed opportunity. The form is logically organized (demographics → from/to parties → date range → record types → purpose → format/method → legal notices → signature) with clear section delineation. The record type selection offers approximately 25 checkboxes across three categories (Hospital Visits, Office Visits, Diagnostic Imaging), giving patients granular control.

The language is mostly accessible, with the opening instruction plainly stating what the form does. However, the legal sections contain dense language including a broad liability waiver: "I will not hold Grady... responsible for anything that may happen from the use or release of my PHI." The completeness warning — "If any selection is incomplete, this form may be considered invalid" — could discourage submission if patients are uncertain about any field.

## Submission & Delivery

Critically, **submission options are limited to in-person drop-off and postal mail only**. The form-3 cover page explicitly lists only these two options for submitting the completed form. No fax number is provided for form submission, no email submission is available, and no online portal exists. This means a patient cannot complete the entire process without either physically visiting the hospital or waiting for postal mail.

For *receiving* records, options are better: the current form-1 offers encrypted email delivery, paper, CD, mail, pick-up, and fax (continuing care only). Form-3's cover page also references electronic delivery through CIOX Health (now Datavant), with 2-business-day processing for electronic and 7–10 days for mail.

## Barriers & Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The broad liability waiver bundled into the authorization is the most significant concern — patients should not be asked to waive accountability as a condition of records access. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which exceeds what's needed when photo ID is also required. Mandatory government-issued photo ID may burden patients of a safety-net hospital who lack such documentation.

**Bright spots**: The encrypted email delivery option on form-1 is genuinely uncommon and valuable. The form-3 cover page provides excellent operational guidance — processing timelines, fee disclosure ($6.50 max), and the note that continuing care requests are free. Multiple delivery format options (paper, CD, email) give patients real choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

Grady Memorial Hospital makes its forms easy to find and offers some progressive delivery options, but falls short on two critical dimensions: the forms are entirely paper-based (non-fillable, print-and-handwrite only) and submission requires physical delivery. The generic authorization form does not center patient self-access, and the liability waiver raises compliance concerns. For a major public hospital, the absence of any digital submission pathway and the reliance on a third-party release form for patient access represent meaningful barriers. **Grade: C.**

# Memorial Healthcare System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Memorial Healthcare System (Hollywood, FL) is a government-owned regional hospital system serving South Florida. The system's medical records page provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" form available in three languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole), plus a separate Request for Amendment form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form; all record requests flow through the same HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release.

## Pathways and Primary Form

The primary pathway is a downloadable PDF form (form-1.pdf in English) linked from the main website at Patients & Visitors > Medical Records. The form lists five delivery methods — Pick-up, Mail Out, e-Delivery, CD, and MyChart — prominently at the top, showing the org supports both traditional and electronic record delivery. MyChart is referenced as a delivery option, suggesting patients may also be able to request records through their patient portal. The medical records page states a two-business-day processing commitment, far faster than the HIPAA-allowed 30-day window.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is titled "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" and is structured around disclosing records to a named recipient (Section 4: "This information is to be released to: Name / Address"). While an email field explicitly reads "I request my records be sent to me at this e-mail address" — clear patient-access language — the overall form design is a generic authorization. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and Section 5h requires patients to state a purpose for the disclosure, which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form and process as an attorney or insurer, figuring out which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The medical records page is linked from the main navigation, the PDF is directly downloadable without login or CAPTCHA, and all language versions are grouped on the same page. No bot blocking was encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — every checkbox, text field, and signature line must be completed by hand after printing. This is consistent across all three language versions. The file is bloated at 2.45 MB (vs. ~700 KB for the identically structured Spanish and Creole versions), with 23 embedded fonts and garbled hidden content from overlapping template layers — including staff business cards, physician rosters, and internal template labels like "JDCH Oncology BC (Multiple Doctors & Locations) FRONT." This hidden content inflates file size and produces garbled output for assistive technologies.

The form's content is organized in five numbered sections with logical flow: facility selection, patient identification, record type selection (~15 granular options), recipient information, and acknowledgment statements. The acknowledgments (Sections 5a–5h) are dense legal text — particularly the electronic delivery risk-shifting language in 5e, which requires patients to "knowingly and voluntarily assume this risk and all consequences, losses and damages" for electronic records. This language could discourage patients from exercising their right to receive records electronically.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No notarization or witness is required.** Fees are not disclosed on the form itself; the website mentions "copy charges as authorized by Florida law" with an exception for records sent to treating physicians. The six-month authorization expiration is standard. No in-person-only submission restriction exists — forms can be mailed. However, there is no explicit electronic submission pathway for the form itself (no fax, no email-based submission explicitly stated, though MyChart may serve this role).

**Bright spots** are notable. The trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is exemplary and uncommon — most organizations offer at most English and Spanish. The five delivery methods, including e-Delivery and MyChart, are forward-thinking. The two-business-day processing commitment is remarkably fast. Granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control.

**Red flags** include the electronic delivery risk-shifting language (Section 5e), the purpose field that may create an impression that patients need to justify their access, and the bloated English PDF with garbled hidden content that affects accessibility tools.

## Overall Assessment

Memorial Healthcare System demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness in several areas — multilingual access, fast processing, and electronic delivery options — but is held back by a non-fillable, generic authorization form that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The form's paper-based workflow and dense legal language create unnecessary friction. The org earns a solid **B** grade overall: excellent findability and some compliance strengths offset by a fundamentally paper-based process and a form that wasn't designed with patients as the primary audience.

# Intermountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) is a community hospital within the Intermountain Health system (formerly Intermountain Healthcare), a major nonprofit health system operating across Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming. The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones — all three retrieved documents are branded and published by Intermountain Health at the enterprise level.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all hosted on Intermountain Health's website:

1. **Form 1** (legacy, 2017): "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — a general-purpose third-party release form. Non-fillable, branded under the old "Intermountain Healthcare" name. Effectively superseded but still accessible online.
2. **Form 2** (06/2025): "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — a fillable third-party disclosure form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug explicitly reads `request-records-be-sent-to-someone-else`.
3. **Form 3** (06/2025): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a fillable patient self-access form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug reads `request-records-for-yourself`.

The most relevant form for a patient requesting their own records is **form 3**, which is the primary basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Intermountain Health stands out for explicitly separating patient self-access from third-party release into **two distinct forms**. Form 3 is titled "Patient Request for Health Information," uses question-based section headings ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?"), and defaults to "Self" as the first delivery recipient option. This is meaningfully different from the common pattern of funneling all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form. The footer acknowledges the patient's right of access under HIPAA.

One blemish: Form 2 (the third-party form) confusingly includes a "Patient Access Information" section with bullets about supervised in-person review and photo ID requirements, blurring the line between the two forms. However, the existence of a separate, cleaner patient-access form mitigates this.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF download links with no login, portal, or JavaScript rendering required. No bot blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on two domains — the legacy `intermountainhealthcare.org` and the current `prod.intermountainhealth.org` — which creates minor confusion but did not impede retrieval. The URL paths are descriptive and logical.

## Form Document Quality (Form 3)

Form 3 is a single-page, fully fillable PDF with 48 interactive fields, Print/Clear buttons, and a clean numbered 7-section layout. The language is plain and direct — section headings are phrased as questions, and the instruction "Please fill out all sections to avoid delay" is practical. Record types are covered by 12 checkboxes spanning clinical, imaging, billing, and substance use categories. Delivery options include paper mail, in-person pickup, and electronic (email, USB, CD, portal, other) with a free-text specification field. At ~2,030 characters of text, the form is admirably concise with no dense legal boilerplate.

Submission methods include email, fax, and mail — organized by state (UT/ID routes to Murray, CO/NV/MT/WY routes to Broomfield). Email submission is a genuine accessibility feature enabling fully digital completion and submission.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. Multiple remote submission options (email, fax, mail) are available — no in-person-only restriction. Fee language is vague: "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records" without specifying amounts, which could deter patients. The UT/ID email routes to R1 RCM (`MedRecReq@r1rcm.com`), a third-party vendor, without explanation on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-access form** separate from third-party authorization — uncommon and patient-centered
- **48 fillable fields** on a single page with Print/Clear buttons — excellent digital-first design
- **Question-based section headings** make the form feel conversational rather than bureaucratic
- **Email submission accepted** — a fully digital pathway from completion to submission
- **Electronic delivery explicitly offered** including email, USB, CD, portal, and "other"
- **Multilingual interpretation notices** on the legacy form (Chinese Traditional and Spanish)

## Overall Assessment

Intermountain Health provides one of the stronger patient access experiences in this study. The deliberate separation of patient self-access from third-party release, combined with a well-designed fillable form and multiple electronic submission channels, demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness. The form's plain language, logical structure, and concise single-page format make it accessible without assistance. Minor weaknesses — vague fee disclosure, undisclosed vendor routing, and a confusing legacy form still online — prevent a top-tier score but do not materially impede patient access.

# Blessing Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Blessing Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Quincy, Illinois, part of Blessing Health System. Five documents were retrieved — three superseded English versions (April 2023 and 2015), the current English authorization form (September 2025), and a current Spanish translation. The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf**, the September 2025 English "BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information," which is directly linked from the organization's Medical Records page alongside its Spanish counterpart (form-5.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Blessing Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary pathway is a **generic HIPAA authorization form** used for all releases of information — patient self-access, third-party disclosures, insurance, legal, and care transfers alike. The form uses bidirectional "RELEASE RECORDS FROM" / "RECORDS GOING TO" fields designed for inter-party transfers. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively authorizing the release of records from Blessing to themselves. The purpose options include "Personal reasons," which accommodates patient requests but does not distinguish them legally or procedurally from third-party authorization.

Notably, the retrieval notes indicate that Blessing Health also offers an **online records request tool** with identity verification via driver's license photo, mentioned on the Medical Records webpage. This provides a parallel digital pathway, though the PDF form remains the primary documented route.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Blessing Hospital authorization forms immediately returned direct PDF links, and the Medical Records page at blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords is well-organized under "For Patients > Request Medical Records." The one concern is version sprawl: three outdated English versions (from 2015 and April 2023) remain accessible at their original URLs with no deprecation notices or redirects. A patient arriving via a cached search result could unknowingly download a superseded form — including one that still requires a witness signature the organization has since eliminated.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4.pdf) is a **digitally authored, non-fillable 2-page PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks must be filled by hand after printing; circle instructions ("(Circle) Pick up or Mail or Fax or Email") reveal its print-first design. Despite this, the form is well-structured: patient demographics flow into records source/destination, then record type checkboxes (15 specific categories plus "Other"), sensitive information authorization, purpose, legal disclosures, and signatures. A dedicated page 2 provides **field-by-field completion guidelines** with plain-language examples — a genuine standout feature that most organizations omit.

The language is a mix: legal boilerplate on the authorization side is moderately dense, but the guidelines page compensates with concrete, accessible explanations. One persistent grammatical issue ("I authorize the use or disclosure of the above named individual's health information, its employees and agents, to furnish") creates ambiguity about who is authorizing what.

## Barriers and Compliance

The September 2025 revision made a significant improvement by **removing the witness signature requirement** that was present in the April 2023 versions — a barrier the organization itself recognized as unnecessary. No notarization is required. Photo identification "may be required," using permissive rather than mandatory language. The form does not disclose fees, though the website mentions a $6.50 flat fee for certain requests; HIPAA requires patients to be informed of fees before authorizing. The mandatory date range requirement ("MUST specify date range") could create friction for patients seeking comprehensive records. Submission can be made via mail or **fax** to three listed locations (Blessing Health System, Blessing Health Hannibal, and Denman Services), so patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

Blessing Hospital demonstrates several above-average practices: a **Spanish translation** linked alongside the English form, the detailed **completion guidelines** on page 2, **email as a delivery option**, active form improvement (witness requirement removal), and an **online records request tool** as an alternative pathway. The form is managed through PolicyStat, suggesting systematic version control.

## Overall Assessment

Blessing Hospital earns a **B** grade. The organization provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with helpful instructions and a Spanish translation — above average for a community hospital. However, the generic authorization design means patients requesting their own records must navigate a form not designed for them, and the non-fillable PDF format creates a paper-dependent workflow. The availability of an online records request tool and fax submission partially compensate for the print-and-fill form, but the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway and the absence of fee disclosure on the form itself are notable gaps.

# Columbia Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbia Memorial Hospital (CMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Astoria, Oregon. Two ROI forms were found: an English-language "Release of Information" form (HIPAA Form 3B, revised February 2025) and a Spanish translation (HIPAA Form 3Bsp, revised August 2017). Both are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms — the hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access request form distinct from third-party release authorization.

## Access Pathway

CMH funnels all record requests — whether from patients seeking their own records or third parties — through a single generic ROI authorization form. The form's "Purpose" checkboxes (Continuing Care, Insurance, Legal, Other) do not include "Personal use" or "Patient access," forcing a patient requesting their own records to select "Other" and write in a reason. The bidirectional design (Section C has both "Send Records To" and "Request Records From" fields) further signals that this form was designed for inter-facility transfers, not individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The hospital does offer a patient portal (myCMH) for partial record access, but the primary written pathway for requesting complete records is this generic ROI form. There is no evidence of a dedicated patient access request process that distinguishes individual rights from third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page at `columbiamemorial.org/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/` links directly to both the English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative search strategies were needed — basic website navigation sufficed. The page also prominently states that "Records are free to patients who request their records," which is a notable positive signal adjacent to the form links.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a cleanly structured 2-page PDF with five labeled sections (A through E). Page 1 is the patient-facing authorization; page 2 is for hospital administrative use only. The layout is logical and navigable, with clear section headers and a well-organized record-type checklist offering 11 specific categories (Emergency Room, Lab Reports, Imaging, etc.) each with a date-of-service field.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). All data entry relies on printed blank lines, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the PDF was clearly created in a layout tool capable of adding interactive fields.

The language is generally plain and accessible. The opening purpose statement ("This form is an authorization to release protected health information") is clear and direct. The signature block language is standard without excessive legalese. There are no instructions or guidance text beyond the section labels, and no statement of patient rights beyond the required notice about entitlement to a copy of the signed authorization.

Submission methods are not explicitly stated on the form itself, though the header lists both a phone number and fax number. The page 2 hospital-use section tracks delivery via "Pt. Pick-Up," "Mailed," "Faxed," and "Electronic" — but these are staff-facing fields, not patient-facing options. A patient filling out the form independently would have to infer that faxing is acceptable.

## Barriers and Compliance

CMH demonstrates several positive practices: no notarization or witness requirement, no in-person mandate, and an explicit commitment to free records for patient access (stated on the website, though not on the form itself). Processing time is stated as 72–96 business hours.

The primary compliance concern is the absence of explicit expiration date/event language and revocation instructions in the form text — elements required by HIPAA § 164.508(c)(1)(v) for valid authorizations. Additionally, the form includes no reference to patient rights under HIPAA, no information about fees on the form itself, and no delivery format options for the patient.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Bilingual form availability (English and Spanish) is uncommon, especially for a small rural critical access hospital, and demonstrates attention to community language needs. The explicit "records are free" statement is exemplary transparency. The well-organized section structure makes the form more navigable than many single-block authorization forms.

**Red flags:** The Spanish form is nearly 8 years older than the English version (2017 vs. 2025), creating a risk that Spanish-speaking patients encounter outdated language or missing sections. Page 2 of the Spanish form is entirely untranslated. The form's missing expiration/revocation language may render signed authorizations technically non-compliant.

## Overall Assessment

Columbia Memorial Hospital provides a reasonably accessible, well-organized ROI process with commendable bilingual availability and fee transparency. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and gaps in compliance language prevent it from achieving the highest marks. A patient can get their records here without unreasonable barriers, but the process was not designed with the individual access use case as a priority.

# Troy Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Troy Regional Medical Center is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Troy, Alabama. The organization presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in the study: the only ROI form available is a decade-old, image-only scanned PDF hosted on a defunct legacy website, with no corresponding page or link on the hospital's current site.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page "Release of Information/PHI" authorization (form-1.pdf), dated February 2015. It is a general-purpose third-party release authorization—not a patient-access-specific form—though it does include a "Self" checkbox among the recipient options (alongside Physician, Attorney, and Other). No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

The form offers three delivery methods via checkbox: mail, fax, and in-person pickup. However, the form itself contains **no submission instructions**—no mailing address, fax number, email address, or department name. A patient who downloads and completes this form would have no idea where to send it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Troy Regional Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization that treats a patient requesting their own records identically to an attorney or physician requesting records on someone's behalf. The form's legal language—including a broad liability waiver and re-disclosure warnings—is oriented toward third-party release scenarios and is conceptually mismatched when a patient checks "Self."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required exceptional effort. The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) has no medical records page, no HIM department listing, and no downloadable forms. The Patient Information page returned a 502 Bad Gateway error. The form was ultimately located only on the hospital's legacy FastHealth-hosted site (trmc.fasthealth.com), which is no longer linked from the current site. A real patient navigating the current website would almost certainly fail to find this form. Only archival web searching revealed it.

## Form Document Quality

The form is an image-only scan (grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI) with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers, cannot be searched or copied, and must be printed and filled entirely by hand. The scan quality introduces some blur, and the legal text is in small (approximately 9–10pt) type. It is served over unencrypted HTTP.

Despite the poor technical quality, the visual layout is reasonably organized. The title is clear, fields flow logically from demographics to record type selection to signatures, and the form fits on a single page. Record type granularity is adequate, with 10+ checkbox options plus an "Entire Record" option and date range fields.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Several significant barriers are present:

- **"All fields MUST be completed" warning**: The form states that any blank field renders the authorization invalid—an overreach beyond HIPAA's actual requirements that could deter patients who cannot provide every piece of information.
- **Broad liability waiver**: Patients must discharge the facility from "any and all liabilities" as a condition of signing—not a HIPAA requirement and inappropriate for patient self-access.
- **Witness signature required**: A witness signature line adds an unnecessary step with no legal basis under HIPAA for patient access requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no contact information for where to send the completed authorization.
- **Anti-conditioning language contradicts itself**: The form states treatment may not be conditioned on authorization, then immediately notes that "if conditioning is permitted, refusal to sign... may result in denial of care."

## Strengths

The only modest bright spot is the record type granularity—patients can select specific record types or request the entire record, with date range specification. The form also correctly references revocation rights.

## Overall Assessment

Troy Regional Medical Center's patient access experience is among the poorest possible. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, image-only scan quality, generic third-party framing, multiple compliance red flags, and a form that is over a decade old paints a picture of an organization that has not invested in patient access infrastructure. A patient attempting to request their own records online from this facility would face a near-impossible task.

# Abbeville Area Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Abbeville Area Medical Center (AAMC) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Abbeville, South Carolina. Two documents were found on its website: an authorization form for releasing protected health information (form-1.pdf) and a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices brochure (form-2.pdf). Only the authorization form is relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Patient Self-Access Distinction

AAMC provides a single, generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (HIM 1022) for all record requests. The form is clearly designed for third-party release — it asks the patient to identify a "Name/Facility" recipient and authorize disclosure "to the following individual or group." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the patient and the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no separate pathway or section for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524, and no mention of the right to access one's own records anywhere on the authorization form.

The companion HIPAA brochure (form-2.pdf) does articulate patient rights well, including the right to electronic copies and a 30-day response timeline, but this informational document is entirely disconnected from the authorization workflow. A patient would need to read two separate documents and synthesize the information themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via Patients & Visitors navigation. The PDF is directly linked and downloads without login, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking. The WordPress site is simple and functional. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form is a single page — admirably brief compared to multi-page forms at other organizations. It follows a logical numbered structure: authorization/recipient identification, record type selection (16 specific checkboxes), dates of service, purpose, and signature block. However, the form has significant technical limitations:

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields. All checkboxes are static Unicode characters, and all blanks are underscored lines. A patient must print the PDF and fill it in by hand.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no address, fax number, email, or department contact. A patient downloading this from the website would have no idea where to send the completed form. The fax number and mailing address must be found separately (the NPP brochure provides the Privacy Officer's P.O. Box and phone number).
- **No "All Records" option**: The 16 granular checkboxes are useful for targeted requests but there is no "Complete Medical Record" option for patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Ambiguous fields**: Item 2 ("Date records were printed and/or CD was requested") appears to be an internal staff field but is numbered as if patients should complete it.

The language is a mix of plain English at the top and denser legal boilerplate at the bottom. Required fields are marked with asterisks, but the legend ("* Must Have Information") appears only at the very bottom of the page.

## Barriers

- **Witness requirement**: The form requires two witness signatures (marked with asterisks as required), which goes beyond HIPAA requirements for patient self-access and creates a logistical barrier.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: The form automatically includes authorization to release psychiatric, substance abuse, HIV, and STD records with no opt-out mechanism. Patients who want general medical records but wish to exclude sensitive categories cannot do so.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signing, which could force resubmission if processing is delayed.
- **No fee information**: The form discloses nothing about costs. The NPP brochure vaguely mentions "there will be a charge" without amounts.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: Everything fits on one page, reducing patient burden.
- **Fax acceptance**: The form explicitly states "A faxed copy of this release shall be deemed as having the same effect as the original," enabling remote submission.
- **Granular record-type selection**: The 16 checkboxes give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **NPP quality**: The privacy brochure includes clear language about the right to electronic copies and a 30-day timeline — strong for a small critical access hospital.

## Overall Assessment

AAMC provides a minimally adequate but dated approach to patient record requests. The form is easy to find and mercifully short, but it offers no digital-first workflow, no patient-access-specific pathway, and no submission instructions. A patient must print the form, handwrite their information, find a fax number or mailing address from a separate document, and obtain two witness signatures — all to exercise a fundamental HIPAA right. The organization earns credit for accessibility of retrieval and brevity of form, but loses ground on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and unnecessary barriers. Grade: **C**.

# Mankato Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mankato Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Mankato, Minnesota. Two PDF forms were found — both versions of the same "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" document (form MC032). Form-1 (revised 02/23) is the current version; form-2 (revised 07/20) is a superseded version that remains publicly accessible. The clinic also offers an online medical record request tool and accepts submissions via fax, email, and DocuSign, providing patients with multiple channels beyond the PDF form itself.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Mankato Clinic does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. Both forms use a generic two-party structure — "Release my medical records from" (source) and "Share my medical records with" (destination) — requiring a patient who wants their own records to awkwardly list Mankato Clinic as the source and themselves as the destination. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no indication that patients have a legal right to obtain their records. The form is framed entirely as a release/disclosure authorization.

That said, the clinic does offer an **online medical record request tool** at a separate URL, which may provide a more streamlined patient self-access experience. The ROI page also notes that DocuSign is accepted, and patients can submit signed authorizations by fax (507-388-1878) or email (ROI@mankatoclinic.com). This gives patients practical electronic submission options even though the PDF form itself is print-oriented.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced direct PDF links and the dedicated Release of Information page at `mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/`. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The ROI page provides clear contact information and links to both the PDF form and the online request tool. One minor concern: both the current and superseded form versions remain live with no redirect or deprecation notice, which could confuse patients.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — page 1 is the authorization, page 2 is a full page of field-by-field instructions. Despite being natively digital, the form has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, handwrite, and return via fax or mail. The policy that "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized" reinforces the print-and-sign workflow.

The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → source → destination → record types → reason → signature. Section headers use bolded questions ("WHO HAS INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE RELEASED?") with sidebar labels, creating a clear visual hierarchy. The form-1 revision improved readability by replacing clinical labels ("Health Care Facility / Provider") with plain language ("Release my medical records from"). The 11 record-type checkboxes cover a reasonable range including sensitive categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health/substance abuse). The instruction page is a genuine bright spot — section-by-section guidance that is uncommon and practically useful.

The form is English-only. Field count is moderate (approximately 20 fields including patient demographics, source/destination addresses, checkboxes, and signature). The legal boilerplate is clear and reasonably concise.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **Fees**: Vaguely disclosed — "I understand there may be a charge" with no amounts or schedule. Patients cannot anticipate costs before submitting.
- **Turnaround**: 7–10 business days stated, well within HIPAA's 30-day window.
- **Witness line**: The older form-2 includes a "Witnessed by" line (removed in form-1), which could have been perceived as a barrier.
- **Delivery options**: The form lists physical delivery methods only (given, mailed, faxed, pick up). The older form-2 instructions explicitly state "Medical records are not able to be emailed." No electronic delivery option appears on either form.
- **Authorization expiration**: 12 months with written revocation — standard and compliant.
- **Treatment conditioning**: Properly disclosed with HIPAA-compliant exceptions.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated instruction page** with practical guidance ("We prioritize requests by appointment date")
- **Multiple ROI contact points** — three offices with dedicated phone/fax, plus email
- **Accepts any HIPAA-compliant form**, including the Minnesota Standard Consent Form
- **Online request tool** available as an alternative to the PDF form
- **Modernized plain-language labels** in the current form version

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable fields on a natively digital PDF — an unnecessary friction point
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release
- Vague fee disclosure with no specific amounts
- No mention of patient rights or HIPAA Right of Access
- Two versions of the same form hosted simultaneously without deprecation notice

## Overall Assessment

Mankato Clinic makes its ROI form easy to find and provides multiple submission channels (fax, email, online tool), which removes the most critical access barriers. The form itself is well-organized with an unusually helpful instruction page. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization framing (no patient access pathway differentiation), and vague fee disclosure keep it from excelling. The organization's practical accommodations — multiple contact points, alternative submission methods, acceptance of any HIPAA-compliant form — partially compensate for the form's design limitations.

# Yale New Haven Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH), a major teaching hospital in New Haven, CT, is part of the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS). For medical records requests, YNHH uses a system-wide fillable PDF form titled "Authorization for Access/Release of Information" (Form F4918Eng, dated 07/19). A second form exists for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, another YNHHS facility, but it is not the primary form for YNHH patients. The assessment below focuses on Form 1 as the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records from Yale New Haven Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient-Friendly Features

YNHH does not offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from its third-party release authorization. The single system-wide form serves both purposes. However, the form makes notable accommodations for patient self-access: the title includes the word "Access" (not just "Release"), "Personal use" is listed as the first purpose option, and the form supports bidirectional requests (both "RELEASE information TO" and "OBTAIN information FROM"). Despite these touches, the underlying structure is a generic HIPAA authorization. A patient requesting their own records must designate themselves as the "recipient" — an awkward fit that reveals the form's third-party-release DNA. The form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or frame the request as an exercise of the patient's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search immediately surfaced it on the YNHHS parent system website, which hosts a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page with direct PDF download links. No login, account creation, or bot-blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on ynhhs.org (parent system) rather than ynhh.org (hospital), which is logical but could cause mild confusion for patients starting at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

Form 1 is an impressive digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 97 interactive form fields — one of the highest counts in the study. Every data-entry point appears to have an interactive field, enabling patients to complete the form entirely on-screen before printing for signature. The two-page layout follows a logical flow: patient identity → purpose → recipient → delivery method → facility/visit selection → date range → record types → sensitive information exclusions → legal disclosures → submission instructions → signature. Sections are clearly delineated and the form is dense but functional.

The language is mostly clear in the data-entry sections but shifts to dense legal prose in the "I understand that" statements on page 2. The minor consent paragraph is particularly complex, with nested age thresholds under Connecticut state law. The sensitive information section uses an opt-out model (all sensitive records released unless the patient initials specific exclusions), which is patient-friendly in intent but uses double-negative framing that could confuse.

## Submission and Delivery

The form offers robust submission options: mail (PO Box 9565, New Haven), fax (203-688-4645), and three email addresses differentiated by entity (Hospital, NEMG, Yale Medicine). This flexibility is a genuine strength — patients can submit electronically without visiting the facility.

For delivery, five options are available: MyChart portal (requiring an active account), mail, fax, secure email, and pick-up. MyChart delivery is a standout feature that most ROI forms lack, offering an end-to-end electronic pathway for records receipt.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The authorization is valid for one year, and revocation rights are clearly explained. The voluntariness statement is explicit: treatment is not conditioned on signing.

The main compliance gap is ambiguous fee language. "Reasonable cost-based fees apply" appears next to radiology images, while "There may be a charge for copies in accordance with Connecticut law" appears in the legal section. Neither amount is disclosed, and the form does not clarify whether the HIPAA cost-based fee ceiling applies when a patient requests their own records. The turnaround commitment of 10 business days is explicit and well within HIPAA's 30-day limit.

## Notable Strengths

- **97 fillable fields** — exceptionally high digital-first form design
- **MyChart delivery** — electronic records receipt via patient portal
- **Multiple submission channels** — three email addresses, fax, and mail
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific categories plus complete record option
- **10-business-day turnaround commitment** with a customer service phone number

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as third-party requesters
- **Wet signature required** — breaks the digital workflow (fill → print → sign → scan → email)
- **Fee language is ambiguous** — does not distinguish patient-access fees from third-party fees
- **Form last updated July 2019** — nearly seven years old, may not reflect current policies
- **No multilingual versions found**

## Overall Assessment

Yale New Haven Hospital provides a competent, digitally mature records request experience that falls short of true patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF, multiple submission/delivery options, and MyChart integration demonstrate genuine investment in accessibility. However, the organization has not taken the step of creating a distinct patient access pathway — patients must navigate a dual-purpose authorization form designed primarily for third-party release. The result is a solid B-level experience: functional and mostly friction-free, but not designed around the patient's perspective.

# University Medical Center of Southern Nevada — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC) is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Las Vegas. Three documents were retrieved: two versions of the same PHI Release Authorization form (a current 2019 version and a superseded 2016 version) and a Request for Amendment form. The primary form for patient self-access is the 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

UMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting one's own records is a generic "Protected Health Information (PHI) Release Authorization" form — the same form used for third-party disclosures to attorneys, insurers, and other providers. The form includes a "Patient (self)" checkbox under the recipient section, which adapts it for self-access use, but the framing remains third-party-oriented: "I authorize the following facility(ies) to release my Protected Health Information." A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access must navigate the same full authorization form as someone authorizing release to a third party, including selecting a "purpose" (Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Care) — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access requests.

## Findability: A Significant Gap

The most striking finding is a disconnect between the website and the ROI form. UMC's Medical Records page (`umcsn.com/patients-visitors/patient-information/medical-records-and-birth-certificate-process`) links only to the Request for Amendment form — it does **not** link to the PHI Release Authorization that patients need to request copies of their records. The ROI form is only discoverable via web search or by knowing the direct URL. Compounding this, the superseded 2016 version remains hosted at an active URL with no indication it is obsolete, meaning patients could unknowingly submit the wrong version. This is a serious findability failure for a core patient rights document.

## Form Document Quality

The 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf) is a two-page, digitally-composed PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (9 fonts, 3 embedded images), it offers no interactive form fields. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and then determine how to submit it.

The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → facility selection → record type selection → sensitive information consent → recipient → purpose/format → legal statements → signature. The structure is reasonable, but institutional conventions undermine usability. The header instruction "PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" assumes clinical context meaningless to a patient at home. An unexplained barcode-like code ("*ROIRCD*") appears at the top. The header states "Page 1 of 1" on what is actually a 2-page document.

Language is mostly clear but formal. The sensitive information section deserves credit for its granular, well-explained approach — five categories (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, psychotherapy, genetic records) each with individual Yes/No consent and required initials.

## Submission: A Critical Omission

The ROI form specifies how records will be *delivered* to the patient (mail, fax, email, CD-ROM, pick-up) but does **not** state how to *submit the completed authorization*. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or portal URL appears on the form for submission. The only address on the form is for written revocation. By contrast, the amendment form (form-3) provides four clear submission channels: mail, walk-in, fax (702-207-8330), and email (HIMManagementAnalysts@umcsn.com). A patient would need to locate this information independently — likely from the Medical Records page that paradoxically doesn't link to the ROI form.

## Barriers and Compliance

UMC avoids several common barriers: no notarization is required, Social Security Number is explicitly marked as optional, and the form includes good rights language (voluntariness, non-conditioning of treatment, right to revoke). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "subject to reproduction fees in accordance with federal / state regulations" — without specifying amounts or noting that fees for patient self-access are limited by law. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions found.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular sensitive information controls**: Five-category consent with individual opt-in/opt-out is better than most ROI forms
- **Email as a delivery option**: Listed alongside mail, fax, CD-ROM, and pick-up
- **SS# marked optional**: Explicit labeling that many forms omit
- **"Patient (self)" checkbox**: Acknowledges patient self-access as a use case

## Overall Assessment

UMC provides a functional but poorly surfaced records request process. The form itself is adequate — clearly structured with good sensitive-information handling and reasonable rights language. But the patient experience is undermined by three compounding failures: the form isn't linked from the obvious website location, it isn't fillable despite being digitally composed, and it doesn't tell patients how to submit it. A patient navigating UMC's website in the expected way would find the amendment form but not the release authorization form. The organization treats records release as an institutional process that patients happen to participate in, rather than as a patient right that deserves a dedicated, discoverable pathway.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MUSC Health University Medical Center in Charleston, SC is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina health system. The organization provides three pathways for patients to request their medical records: a downloadable PDF authorization form, MyChart patient portal, and an online Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool. Three documents were retrieved: the English authorization form (form-1), a MyChart instructional guide (form-2), and a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway Assessment

MUSC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary pathway is a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form that serves both patient access and third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same "Release Records From" / "Release Records To" framework designed for third-party disclosures, filling in their own name as both patient and recipient — an unintuitive experience. The form includes "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" as one of eight purpose-of-release checkboxes, but patient self-access is not called out as a distinct pathway.

However, MUSC partially compensates by offering the MyChart portal pathway, where patients can submit records requests electronically. The MyChart guide (form-2) describes a step-by-step process for requesting records within the portal, though it prominently warns about fees and a prepayment requirement. The Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool is a third option but requires webcam identity verification, adding friction.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A standard web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL at a clean, descriptive path (`muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf`). The medical records landing page links directly to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. The Spanish version was similarly accessible at a predictable URL. This is a model of straightforward form availability.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a significant shortcoming given that the form offers modern delivery options like encrypted email and MyChart. The form was clearly designed digitally (9 fonts, clean layout) but not built for digital completion.

The layout follows a logical progression: patient demographics → records source/destination → record types → purpose → date range → delivery method → legal disclosures → signature. The record-type options are well-designed, including a helpfully defined "Abstract" option. Five delivery methods are offered (mail, MyChart, fax, encrypted email, other) — above average for ROI forms. However, page 1 is dense, with legal disclosures compressed into a wall of small-print text at the bottom.

Language is a mix of plain instructions and legal/regulatory terminology. The opening warning ("FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION") is clear but intimidating. Rights disclosures reference specific CFR sections, which is appropriate but not patient-friendly.

## Barriers and Concerns

Several barriers exist. The form requires a **witness signature** — a line with no explanation of when or whether it's required, likely confusing patients into thinking it's always mandatory. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests. The form also requires attaching **a copy of patient identification** for all requests, not just representative requests — an extra step that adds friction for patients without easy copier access. The request for the **last 4 digits of SSN** is unnecessary for patient identification and may deter some patients.

The fee situation is a notable red flag. The MyChart instructional guide explicitly states that fees apply to "all patient requests released to the patient" including "search and duplication" — HIPAA only permits reasonable cost-based fees (not search fees) for patient access requests. The guide also describes a **prepayment requirement** before records are released, which may conflict with HHS/OCR guidance on patient access rights.

## Bright Spots

MUSC demonstrates genuine effort in several areas. The **Spanish-language form** (form-3) is a full professional translation preserving the complete structure and content of the English original, with bilingual headers — uncommon among organizations in this study. **Multiple pathways** (PDF, MyChart, Ciox eRequest) give patients genuine choice. **Multiple delivery methods** including encrypted email show digital awareness. The **multi-facility contact directory** on page 2 provides complete information for 9 MUSC locations, and the form explicitly references **45 CFR §164.524** (right to inspect/copy), making HIPAA rights visible to patients.

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health earns a **B grade** overall. The organization makes forms easy to find, offers multiple request pathways and delivery options, provides a Spanish-language version, and includes patient rights language. However, the generic third-party authorization form is not designed around patient self-access, the PDF lacks fillable fields despite digital distribution, and the fee/prepayment language raises compliance concerns. The witness signature and blanket ID requirements add unnecessary barriers. A dedicated patient access form with fillable fields and clearer fee disclosures would meaningfully improve the patient experience.

# SSM Health DePaul Hospital - St. Louis: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health DePaul Hospital in Bridgeton, MO is part of the SSM Health system, a major nonprofit health system operating across the Midwest. The hospital does not maintain its own medical records request forms; instead, it relies on SSM Health's system-wide forms. Two versions were found: an older system-wide form (form-1, "SSMHC" branding, dated 1/2019) and a current St. Louis metro–specific form (form-2, "SSM Health" branding). Form-2 is the applicable document for DePaul Hospital patients. Additionally, SSM Health's medical records page references an electronic request option through the **MRO Express portal** (mroexpress.mrocorp.com) for Missouri facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Both forms are dual-purpose documents titled "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," combining individual access requests and third-party disclosure authorizations into a single instrument. A patient requesting their own records must navigate structure designed for third-party releases — including a "disclose my protected health information to" recipient block with name, address, fax, and relationship fields. The "For personal access" option exists only as a checkbox buried under the "Purpose of Disclosure" section, alongside options like "Insurance/Workers' Compensation" and "Legal."

This dual-purpose design means patients must determine which fields to fill, which to skip, and how to route a form that assumes a releasing-to and releasing-from party. While technically functional, it is not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required moderate effort. The SSM Health medical records page (ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records) uses location-dependent content loading to surface region-specific forms, but the location selector's autocomplete reportedly failed during testing. Starting from DePaul Hospital's location page, the "Get Medical Records" link redirects to the system-wide page without directly linking the St. Louis metro form. A web search for SSM Health medical records forms did surface both PDFs, and the form-2 URL is descriptively structured. Overall, a patient would need 3+ clicks and some navigation persistence.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 — the relevant document — is a **single-page fillable PDF with 69 interactive fields**, representing a genuine digital-first design. Patients can complete the entire form electronically in any PDF viewer without printing. This is a clear strength. The form includes fields for patient demographics, type of access (inspection, hard copy, electronic copy), record type checkboxes with date fields (including sensitive categories like substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV-related information), purpose of disclosure, and a seven-item acknowledgement section covering HIPAA rights.

However, the language is **legalistic** throughout. The acknowledgement section contains seven dense paragraphs written in formal legal register. There are no separate instructions, no plain-language summary, and no guidance helping patients understand which fields apply to their situation. The single-page constraint results in compressed formatting and small text in the acknowledgement section. The form is English-only.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and **no in-person submission mandate**. Fees are disclosed as possible ("I may be required to pay the cost of creating paper copies or electronic media") but without specific amounts and with a TPO exception carve-out. A 30-day response time is committed, and the right to request review of access denials is clearly stated. Revocation rights and non-conditioning of care are explicitly covered.

The most notable concern is the **email delivery warning**: SSM Health states that encrypted email is "the only way to avoid third party interception" and frames unencrypted email delivery as a risky exception requiring patient acknowledgement. While email delivery is technically offered (form-2 includes an email field), the discouraging language may deter patients from choosing electronic delivery. An expiration date field — with research-oriented options — is misplaced for patient access requests and may confuse non-research requestors.

## Notable Strengths

- **69 fillable form fields** on a single page — genuinely fillable, not a flat scan
- **Email delivery option** with explicit email address field (form-2 improvement over form-1)
- **Granular record type selection** with sensitive-category breakouts for substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV
- **MRO Express portal** as an alternative electronic request pathway
- **Clear rights statements** covering 30-day timeline, denial review, and revocation

## Key Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as insurance companies and attorneys
- **Legalistic language** with no plain-language guidance or instructions
- **Email delivery framed as risky exception** rather than standard option
- **English-only** — no multilingual support
- **Expiration date field** inappropriate for patient access requests

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health DePaul Hospital earns a **C grade**. The fillable PDF form and MRO Express portal provide adequate technical infrastructure, and the form covers HIPAA compliance basics without imposing illegitimate barriers. However, the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, combined with dense legal language and no patient-facing guidance, means a patient must work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights. The org meets minimum requirements but falls short of patient-centered design.

# Fallon Medical Complex — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Fallon Medical Complex (FMC) is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Baker, Montana — a rural community in the state's eastern plains. FMC publishes three documents on its Information Management page: a primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a verbal release form (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The primary ROI form is the relevant document for a patient seeking copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

FMC does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form — "Authorization for Access, Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same "Release From" / "Release To" fields used when authorizing disclosure to an insurer or attorney. The form does list "Personal" as a purpose option, which is helpful, but provides no guidance on how a patient should fill in the directional fields when they are both the requester and the recipient. This is a common pattern among small facilities, but it means the patient must figure out which parts of the form apply to their situation.

The verbal release form (form-2) is narrowly scoped to phone-based verbal sharing and explicitly directs patients to form-1 for copies. The NPP (form-3) describes patient rights including the right to inspect and copy records but does not cross-reference the actual forms.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Two web searches led directly to the Information Management page at fallonmedical.org, where all three documents are clearly linked. No login walls, CAPTCHAs, or bot blocking were encountered. The one notable issue: the primary ROI form is published as a Microsoft Word .doc file rather than a PDF, hosted on a Google Cloud Storage bucket with "tmp" in the URL path — an unusual and potentially fragile hosting arrangement for a permanent compliance document.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page document with **zero fillable fields**. It was published as a .doc file and had to be converted to PDF for this study. The lack of fillable fields means every patient must print and handwrite their information. The form has a text layer (not a scan), uses 5 fonts, and is visually legible, but the non-interactive format is a significant accessibility gap — especially for a geographically isolated community where patients may live far from the facility.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → release routing → purpose → record types → date range → disclosure format → sensitive information → patient rights → signatures. The information-type checkboxes offer good granularity (10 categories from "Emergency Report/Records" to "Entire Medical Record"). The dual sensitive-information sections — one for categories to include, one to exclude — are structurally sound but confusingly similar, with identical checkbox labels distinguished only by a header word.

Language is a mix of accessible and legalistic. The "I Understand That" section covers core rights (revocation, non-conditioning, inspection under §164.524) but is dense. There are two spelling errors ("immunodefiency" twice, "proving" for "providing") and a confusing interstitial note ("IF SENDING RECORDS TO FMC, PLEASE MAIL IF MORE THAN 20 PAGES") apparently directed at other facilities rather than patients.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization is required (the witness signature is in the "For Office Use Only" section). Photo ID is required for fax, mail, or email submissions — reasonable identity verification, though potentially burdensome for patients without government-issued ID. The statement "A HIM professional will supervise the review of my medical record" adds friction to in-person review that may feel paternalistic.

**Notable bright spots for a rural CAH:**
- **First copy free** — the form explicitly states patients may receive the first copy without charge, reducing financial barriers.
- **Seven disclosure format options** — paper mail, USB drive/disc, electronic fax, review only, paper pick-up, unencrypted email (with informed consent), and patient portal access. This is remarkably comprehensive for a 25-bed rural hospital.
- **Patient portal integration** — offering portal signup directly from the ROI form bridges paper and digital workflows.
- **Unencrypted email with informed consent** — respects patient autonomy while ensuring awareness of risks.

Submission of the completed form appears possible via fax, mail, or email (implied by the ID requirement language), meaning patients do not need to physically visit the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fallon Medical Complex demonstrates a sincere effort to serve patients within the constraints of a small rural facility. The breadth of delivery format options is genuinely impressive and patient-centered. However, the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a patient access request, published in an outdated format (.doc) with no fillable fields. A patient must print, handwrite, and fax or mail the form — a workflow that falls short of modern accessibility expectations. For a critical access hospital in rural Montana, FMC does better than many peers, but meaningful improvements are within reach: converting to a fillable PDF, separating the patient access pathway, and adding clear instructions for self-access requests would significantly improve the experience.

# Brattleboro Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, an independent nonprofit community hospital in Brattleboro, Vermont, publishes three ROI-related forms on its website. All three are general-purpose HIPAA disclosure authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to or from third parties. None is a dedicated patient access request form. The most current version — form-1.pdf, dated January 2025 — serves as the primary pathway for any patient requesting their own records, though patients must navigate a third-party-oriented workflow to do so.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three forms use a FROM/TO structure designed for transfers between parties. A patient requesting their own records would need to select the "Personal Records" purpose checkbox (available only on form-1 and form-3, not form-2) and enter their own name in the "TO" field — a workable but unintuitive approach. There is no online portal, patient portal integration, or web-based request wizard. The hospital's HIM Department lists a phone number (802-257-8258) and fax number (802-257-8881) on the form header, providing fax as an electronic submission channel, though the form itself never explicitly states how to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Standard web searches immediately returned direct PDF links hosted on the hospital's WordPress site. No login, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. However, the three overlapping forms are published without any landing page, version guidance, or indication of which is current. A patient who finds form-2 (older, shorter, with a witness line and 6-month default expiration) gets a materially different experience than one who finds form-1 (updated, more comprehensive, 12-month expiration, no witness line).

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1.pdf** (the best available) is a 2-page flat PDF. Despite retrieval notes suggesting fillable fields, metadata confirms zero interactive form fields — all blanks are underscore lines and text-rendered checkbox characters. Patients must print, handwrite, and submit via fax or physical delivery. The two-page structure is logical (instructions/rights on page 1, data entry on page 2), and required fields are marked with an asterisk convention. However, page 2 is densely packed with FROM/TO fields, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, verbal communication designees, date ranges, and signature blocks. Some checkbox labels are misaligned across columns. The language mixes plain statements with ALL CAPS instructions and bureaucratic phrasing — Instruction 4, which conditions processing on internal record completeness, is particularly confusing for patients.

The form offers approximately 15 fields for patient completion, a reasonable scope. Record-type checkboxes are comprehensive, covering standard categories plus sensitive information (psychiatric, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, hepatitis) and notably progressive categories (reproductive health care, gender affirming care). Delivery options are limited to "Pick Up" and "Send Out" with no electronic delivery mentioned.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on form-1 (though form-2 includes a witness line that may create perceived barriers). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "in accordance with state and federal law" — without specific amounts or a fee schedule. No response time commitment is stated. The form does not require in-person submission, and fax is available as an electronic submission pathway.

## Notable Strengths

- **Progressive sensitive-information categories**: The January 2025 revision includes Reproductive Health Care and Gender Affirming Care checkboxes — unusually inclusive for a community hospital.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to receive health services" directly addresses a common patient concern.
- **Verbal communication designees**: A dedicated section for authorizing up to three individuals for verbal communication with the hospital goes beyond typical ROI forms.
- **Easy online availability**: Forms are publicly accessible without any barriers to download.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: All forms funnel patients through a generic third-party disclosure workflow.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: The primary form cannot be completed digitally despite its digitally-authored appearance.
- **Multiple unversioned forms**: Three overlapping documents with no guidance creates confusion.
- **No electronic delivery options**: Only physical pickup or mail for receiving records.
- **No explicit submission instructions**: Fax and phone numbers are listed but the form never tells patients how to submit it.

## Overall Assessment

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The forms are easy to find and free of egregious barriers, and the January 2025 update shows thoughtfulness around sensitive health categories. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, non-fillable form format, and absence of electronic delivery options place the hospital behind peers who have modernized their records request processes. The overall experience earns a **C grade** — functional but not patient-centered.

# Mercy General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy General Hospital, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Sacramento, CA, provides patients with a reasonably accessible but structurally fragmented records request process. Three forms were found: a general third-party authorization (form-1), a medical group patient access form (form-2), and a hospital patient access form (form-3). The organization correctly separates patient self-access from third-party release — a meaningful positive — but splits patient access across two entities (hospital vs. medical group), requiring patients to navigate dual tracks.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mercy General Hospital does differentiate individual access from third-party release. Both form-2 and form-3 are titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and explicitly state they will not result in disclosure to anyone other than the patient or their representative. The third-party authorization (form-1) is a clearly separate document. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations funnel all requests through a single generic HIPAA authorization form.

However, the dual-track structure (hospital form vs. medical group form) creates confusion. A patient who received both inpatient and outpatient care at Mercy General would need to submit two different forms to two different departments. The website does not provide clear guidance on which form to use, and the hospital vs. medical group distinction is opaque to most patients.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. All three were accessible via web search and linked from the Dignity Health Sacramento medical records page. One URL from search results returned a 404, suggesting some form reorganization over time, but current links worked. The forms' filenames are reasonably descriptive. Contact information (phone, fax, email) is provided on the medical group form, making it easy for patients to ask questions.

## Form Document Quality

The primary hospital patient access form (form-3) is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a significant gap, especially since the companion third-party authorization (form-1) has 42 fillable fields, demonstrating the organization has the capability to produce interactive PDFs. The medical group form (form-2) also has zero fillable fields. Both patient access forms are print-and-fill documents that were designed for in-person clinical workflows and posted online as an afterthought.

Form-3's text layer suffers from severe font encoding corruption — extracted text contains garbled characters (e.g., "3DWLHQW ,GHQWL¿FDWLRQ" for "Patient Identification"), which likely renders the form inaccessible to screen readers.

The layout of both patient access forms is logical with lettered sections, clear record-type checkboxes, and multiple delivery format options (Paper, USB Drive, CD, Secure Email, Unsecured Email for form-3; mail, pickup, email, flash drive, fax for form-2). Language is mostly plain, though some legalistic phrasing appears in the sensitive records sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flags relate to physician gatekeeping of patient access:

- **Physician veto mechanism**: Form-3 includes a "NOTIFICATION TO DOCTOR" section that actively solicits physician objections to releasing records, without informing the patient of their right to appeal a denial.
- **Physician approval for HIV and psychiatric records**: Both patient access forms require physician/caregiver approval before releasing HIV test results or psychiatric records to the patient — a requirement that likely conflicts with HIPAA's right of access, which generally does not condition patient access on provider approval.
- **ID verification contradiction**: Form-2 demands "PICTURE I.D. MUST BE PRESENTED" while simultaneously offering mail, email, and fax submission — contradictory requirements.

Fee disclosure is vague on both forms ("fees may apply") without specifying amounts. Form-3 references an "attached price list" that is not included in the PDF. Neither form states a response timeline, and neither includes a patient rights section (unlike the third-party authorization form, which does).

## Strengths

- Clear separation of patient access from third-party release, with explicit cross-references between forms
- Multiple electronic delivery options including USB drive, CD, secure and unsecured email
- Inspect-only option on form-2 (no copying fees)
- Direct contact information (phone, fax, email) prominently displayed
- Multi-facility coverage across six Dignity Health Sacramento hospitals

## Overall Assessment

Mercy General Hospital demonstrates good intent in creating dedicated patient access forms separate from third-party authorizations, and offers genuinely flexible delivery options. However, the execution falls short: non-fillable PDFs, encoding accessibility issues, physician gatekeeping provisions, and a confusing dual-track structure undermine patient-centeredness. The organization invests more technical effort in the third-party release form (42 fillable fields) than in its patient access forms (zero fillable fields each), suggesting that patient self-access is not the priority workflow. A patient can ultimately navigate the process, but must contend with printing forms, unclear fee structures, and potentially inappropriate physician approval requirements.

# Western Washington Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Everett, WA. Three ROI-related documents were retrieved: a primary organization-wide fillable authorization form (form-1), a GI department-specific non-fillable release form (form-2), and a generic unbranded authorization hosted on PatientPop (form-3). Form-1 is clearly the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records and is the basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WWMG does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Western Washington Medical Group to RELEASE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION" — a standard third-party release authorization. Patients requesting their own records use the same form as those authorizing release to an attorney, insurer, or another provider. "Personal (to patient)" appears as one of several purpose checkboxes, annotated with "*service fee may apply." There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal option for record requests. The form does not reference the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish individual access rights from third-party authorization. A patient must navigate a form designed around sending records to someone else and adapt it for self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search returned direct PDF links, and WWMG maintains a dedicated Medical Records Request page (wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/) that links to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or portal requirements were encountered. The URL is descriptive and the form is also listed on the Patient Intake and Registration Forms page. The only complication is the existence of three forms — a patient could potentially encounter the inferior GI-specific (form-2) or orphaned PatientPop form (form-3) instead of the primary one, though the website clearly surfaces form-1.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a single-page fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — well above average for healthcare ROI forms. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → record scope → sensitive information exclusions → purpose → expiration → signature. The language is relatively plain, with direct instructions like "PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE." The scope options are strong, offering four ways to define what records are released (all within 3 years, specific condition, specific dates, or mutual exchange). The sensitive information exclusion section gives patients granular control over HIV, STD, psychiatric, and substance abuse records using an opt-out model with required initials.

The form is not a scan — it was designed digitally with clean text, multiple fonts, and embedded branding. At 143 KB for a single page, it is appropriately sized. WWMG's address is pre-filled, reducing patient burden.

## Submission and Delivery

The form directs patients to "visit wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request and refer to the contact info on the chart" for submission instructions, rather than listing submission options directly on the form. The "OFFICE USE ONLY" section indicates records can be faxed, mailed, or emailed — confirming electronic submission pathways exist. This indirect approach adds a step but avoids restricting patients to in-person delivery. Fax availability means patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or witness signature is required. However, two issues stand out:

1. **Vague fee language**: The "*service fee may apply" note next to "Personal (to patient)" is concerning. HIPAA limits fees for patient access to reasonable, cost-based amounts, and this language provides no specifics, potentially discouraging patients or leading to overcharging.

2. **Misleading "ALL" scope**: The "ALL healthcare information" option is silently limited to the last 3 years. A patient seeking their complete history must use the "Specific DATES" option, but this limitation is not explained. The word "ALL" is misleading.

The 90-day default authorization expiration is adequate for patient access requests (HIPAA requires fulfillment within 30 days with one extension) but creates unnecessary re-authorization burden for ongoing provider exchanges. A conflicting 1-year expiration for the "mutual exchange" option adds confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — genuinely digital-first design
- Single-page format that fits all necessary elements concisely
- Strong scope options with granular sensitive-information exclusion controls
- Multi-clinic awareness field routing requests to the correct WWMG location
- Easy-to-find forms with a dedicated Medical Records Request page

## Overall Assessment

WWMG provides a technically competent, well-designed authorization form that is easy to find and fill out digitally. However, it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — patients must navigate a generic authorization form and select the "Personal" purpose checkbox. The vague fee language for patient access is a compliance concern. The form's document quality and digital-first design are above average, but the lack of a patient-centered access pathway keeps this from being an exemplary practice.

# UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, part of the UCHealth system in Aurora, Colorado, provides a solid pathway for patients requesting their own medical records. The organization's medical records page is well-organized, directly links to the current authorization form, and offers an online request portal (MRO Express) as an alternative. Four PDFs were downloaded during retrieval, but only two are genuinely relevant: the current system-wide authorization form (form-4) and an older 2017-era predecessor (form-1). A third form (form-2) is a legacy inter-facility transfer document, and the fourth (form-3) belongs to an entirely different organization — UC Health Cincinnati — retrieved due to domain confusion between uchealth.org (Colorado) and uchealth.com (Cincinnati).

## Access Pathway: Generic Form with Strong Patient Accommodation

UCHealth does not offer a dedicated patient-access-only form. The current form (form-4, document #HIM19000.1025, revised October 2025) is a generic "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it accommodates patient self-access unusually well. The form includes an explicit "If released to self, select method of release" section with four delivery options: email, My Health Connection (patient portal), mail, and PowerShare (for radiology images). The fee schedule is split clearly between patient access (free via portal, free paper up to 100 pages, first radiology disc free) and third-party recipients (retrieval fee plus per-page charges). This dual fee structure is a standout practice — few organizations make this distinction so transparently on the form itself.

The organization also offers MRO Express, an online request portal, as an alternative to the downloadable PDF. This portal provides a fully digital pathway, though our evaluation focused on the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. UCHealth's medical records page (`uchealth.org/access-my-health-connection/medical-records-uchealth/`) was reachable within 1–2 clicks from the main website and clearly presented the download link, online portal option, and location-specific contact information. The only complication was domain confusion: a web search returned a form from UC Health Cincinnati (uchealth.com), which could mislead patients searching generically for "UCHealth" forms. Two older forms (2017 and 2018 vintages) also remain publicly hosted at their original URLs with no indication they are superseded, creating a minor stale-link hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4) is a single-page, digitally generated PDF with a clean text layer — not a scan. Despite its digital-native construction, it has **zero fillable form fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. This is a notable gap: the older form-2 (a legacy inter-facility document) actually had 54 fillable fields, demonstrating that UCHealth has the technical capacity for interactive PDFs but did not apply it to the current form.

The layout is logical — flowing from facility selection through patient demographics, purpose, recipient, date range, record types, disclosures, fees, and signature — but extremely dense. Approximately 28 record-type checkboxes, a full fee schedule, six numbered disclosure statements, a reproductive healthcare warning, and a confidentiality notice are all compressed onto a single page. The form helpfully defines "Visit record" vs. "Visit summary" in parenthetical notes, aiding patient comprehension. Language across the disclosures is plain and accessible, covering right to revoke, voluntary nature, no conditioning on treatment, and re-disclosure risks. The form does not include submission instructions (no address, fax number, or email for where to send it), though this information is presumably on the medical records web page.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

UCHealth imposes no significant barriers: no notarization, no SSN request (a problem on the older form-2, now corrected), no mandatory in-person submission, and no conditioning of treatment on signing. The patient fee structure — free portal delivery and free paper up to 100 pages — is among the most generous observed. A notable bright spot is the reproductive healthcare warning (item 6), alerting patients that released reproductive health information could be used in litigation — a post-*Dobbs* addition reflecting emerging privacy concerns. Sensitive record categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, genetic, sickle cell, reproductive health) each require separate patient consent, providing granular control.

The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (requiring print-and-fill), the absence of submission instructions on the form itself, and the failure to state a processing time commitment (the older form-1 promised 10 business days). The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Overall Assessment

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital earns a solid **B** grade. The organization makes its form easy to find, provides an online portal alternative, clearly accommodates patient self-access with separate delivery options and fee structures, and maintains strong compliance posture. The main shortcomings are the non-fillable PDF format and the dense single-page design. With fillable fields and submission instructions added to the form, this would approach best-in-class.

# Synthesis: Duly Health and Care

## Overview

Duly Health and Care (Downers Grove, IL) is a large independent, for-profit physician practice formerly known as DuPage Medical Group. Four PDF documents were retrieved: one Duly-branded ROI authorization (form-1), two MediCopy vendor authorization forms (forms 2 and 4), and one specialized FMLA/disability intake form (form-3). The primary form for patient self-access is **form-1**, Duly's own "Authorization for Release of Health Information," processed by ScanSTAT Technologies and last updated June 2023.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Duly does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. All four forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any disclosure purpose. Form-1's "Purpose of Disclosure" section includes a "Personal Reasons" checkbox, and forms 2 and 4 offer "Personal Use," but none of these forms are specifically designed around the patient's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. The same witness requirements, fee language, and expiration terms apply regardless of whether the patient is requesting records for themselves or authorizing release to a third party.

The form header does note that records "may be available through MyDMGHealth" (the MyChart patient portal), suggesting a digital self-service alternative exists — but this is a brief aside, not a developed pathway. Delivery methods on form-1 include fax, mail, MyChart, secure e-delivery, and pick-up, which is above-average flexibility. Submission of the completed form can be done via fax (630-873-8797) or email (mrrequests@dupagemd.com), so a patient can submit without visiting the facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Duly's forms was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned direct PDF links on the first attempt. Duly hosts forms on Azure blob storage, and a dedicated medical records request page exists at `dulyhealthandcare.com/services/medical-records-requests`. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor friction: the coexistence of Duly-branded and MediCopy-branded forms could confuse a patient about which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF with a text layer and clean extraction, but **zero fillable fields**. It is a print-and-fill document. Despite being "Updated 062023," the form retains legacy branding — the email uses `@dupagemd.com`, the MyChart URL references `dupagemedicalgroup.com`, and the form ID starts with "DMG." The layout is organized into six clearly numbered sections with a logical flow (patient info → records requested → recipient → delivery → purpose → signature). Record-type checkboxes are granular (11 categories including imaging CDs), and date format examples are provided — helpful details many forms lack. However, the legal text in Section 6 is dense, presented as a continuous block in small type.

The MediCopy forms (2 and 4) use friendlier conversational headings ("Tell us about the patient," "Where are we sending the records?") but also lack fillable fields and have their own issues: form-2 has no submission contact information at all, while form-4 adds a witness requirement.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-1 requires a witness signature unless the request is for continuation/transfer of care or records go directly to the patient. A patient requesting records for "Personal Reasons" must find a witness — an unusual burden with no HIPAA basis. Form-4 imposes the same requirement.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "Charges may apply. Please contact us for details. Cash payments are not accepted." No fee schedule is provided, no amounts are indicated, and there is no acknowledgment that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests. The cash-payment prohibition is unexplained.

**"All records" rejection**: Form-1 explicitly states that "'All records' or incomplete dates are not considered specific." This may improperly limit patient access under HIPAA, which permits patients to request their entire designated record set.

**No notarization** is required — a positive. **Response time** is not stated.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple delivery methods** including MyChart, secure e-delivery, fax, mail, and pick-up — five options on form-1.
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** with 11 categories give patients specific control.
- **Explicit date format examples** reduce ambiguity.
- **Patient rights statements** in form-1's Section 6 cover revocation, right to inspect, right to refuse, and re-disclosure — comprehensive if dense.
- **Easy retrieval** — forms found quickly with no technical barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Duly Health and Care provides a functional but undifferentiated records request process. The primary form is well-organized and offers good delivery flexibility, but it funnels all requests — patient self-access and third-party releases alike — through a single generic authorization with unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, fee opacity, rejection of blanket record requests). The form is not fillable, retains outdated branding, and does not acknowledge the distinction between patient access rights and third-party authorization. A patient can complete the process (print, fill, fax), but the experience is not designed around their needs as a rights-holder under HIPAA.

# Lexington Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lexington Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Lexington, Kentucky. Two ROI authorization forms were found on their website: a current 2024 version (form-1) co-branded with VitalChart, a third-party ROI processing vendor, and a legacy 2014 version (form-2) that remains publicly accessible but appears to be superseded. The 2024 form is the actively linked version on the Patient Forms page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

Lexington Clinic does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release" documents designed to serve all disclosure purposes — patient self-access, transfer of care, legal requests, and other third-party releases. However, form-1 includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Purpose of Disclosure," which effectively signals a Right of Access request even though the form never explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 or uses the term "Right of Access."

The organization funnels all records requests through VitalChart, which processes the authorization and fulfills the request. This vendor-mediated model means the patient completes a single generic authorization form and sends it to VitalChart rather than directly to Lexington Clinic's HIM department. No online portal or digital request wizard is available.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A straightforward web search returned direct PDF download links on the first attempt. The Patient Forms page at lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that the legacy 2014 form (form-2) remains publicly indexed and discoverable via search engines, with no version labeling or "superseded" notice — creating a risk that patients might find and use the outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally composed PDF with a clear text layer but **zero fillable fields** — a significant missed opportunity given its digital origin. A patient must print it, fill it by hand, and then submit it via mail, fax, or email to VitalChart. The layout is well-organized with six numbered sections following a logical "who → where → what → why → cost → sign" flow. Section headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are unusually conversational and patient-friendly for a medical-legal form. However, the legal disclosures in Section 6 shift to dense HIPAA boilerplate, and fitting everything onto one page makes the form somewhat dense.

Record-type granularity is good: patients can select specific providers, date ranges, conditions, and record subtypes (labs, radiology, office notes, immunizations, operative reports). Delivery options include mail, email, and fax (fax restricted to healthcare providers only). Email delivery to patients is a meaningful positive — many organizations offer only mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fee structure**: The form cites KRS 422.317, stating the first copy is free, with additional copies at $1.00 per page. While the first-copy-free provision is patient-friendly, the $1.00/page charge for subsequent copies may exceed HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based fee" limit for Right of Access requests. A $5.00 late fee and "non-refundable once services are rendered" language add financial friction not contemplated by HIPAA's access provisions.

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is not a HIPAA requirement for ROI authorization and raises privacy concerns.

**Submission ambiguity**: While VitalChart's mailing address, phone, fax, and email are listed at the bottom, the form never explicitly instructs patients on how to submit the completed authorization. A patient may be unsure whether they can email the completed form.

**No notarization or witness required** — a positive. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- First copy free with clear Kentucky statutory citation
- Email delivery available to patients (not just providers)
- Conversational, patient-friendly section headers
- Good record-type granularity enabling targeted requests
- Single-page, concise format
- Easy online findability

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Clinic provides a reasonably accessible records request process that clears several important bars: the form is easy to find, well-organized, and can be submitted electronically via fax or email to VitalChart. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization form design (no dedicated patient access pathway), and the potentially non-compliant fee structure for patient access requests hold it back from a higher rating. The organization's approach is typical of mid-sized independent practices that outsource ROI processing to a vendor — functional but not patient-centered.

# Baptist Health Lexington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Baptist Health Lexington is a community hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, part of the Baptist Health (Kentucky) system. It does not maintain facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it relies on system-wide forms published by the parent system at baptisthealth.com. Three documents were retrieved, all system-level.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found:

1. **Form 1 (Primary):** "Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — the current system-wide authorization form, revised February 2026. A 3-page, dual-purpose document covering both patient self-access ("Myself" checkbox) and third-party release ("Other person/organization" checkbox). Includes delivery method options (paper, fax, email, CD, MyChart), record type packages, sensitive information consent, and a helpful "Tips" page. Submission is via fax or mail to a centralized Release of Information office in Louisville.

2. **Form 2:** "Request for Medical Records" — a simpler, 1-page patient-access-specific form hosted on the MyChart portal (mychart.baptist-health.org). Explicitly framed for patients requesting their own records. Dated July 2019, making it nearly seven years old. Notably, it contains no submission instructions — no address, fax number, or email.

3. **Form 3:** An older, undated version of the same system-wide authorization (Form 1). Two pages, still publicly accessible alongside the 2026 version at a non-versioned URL, creating potential patient confusion.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Baptist Health demonstrates partial differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (Form 1) is a generic HIPAA authorization, but it clearly labels a "Myself" option on its first page and notes that purpose of release is "not required if being disclosed directly to patient." A dedicated patient access form (Form 2) does exist but is outdated and lacks submission instructions, making it less useful in practice. The primary pathway a patient would encounter — through the medical records page at baptisthealth.com — is the generic authorization form with a patient self-access checkbox.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Basic web searches and the organization's medical records page led directly to downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The only friction is that a patient searching specifically for "Baptist Health Lexington" must recognize that the parent system's form applies. The coexistence of old and new form versions at similar URLs is a minor navigational hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (Form 1) is digitally authored with a text layer and clean typography, but has **zero fillable fields**. All entry areas are blank lines and non-interactive checkbox graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is well-organized with clear section headers (Patient Info, Release To / Delivery Method, Purpose, Information to Release) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. The record type "Package" system (Key Documentation vs. All Documentation) with detailed descriptions is genuinely helpful. The third page ("Tips for Requesting Medical Record Copies") provides useful practical guidance including a 15-calendar-day turnaround goal, MyChart default delivery, and contact information.

Language is mostly plain on page 1 but dense with required legal text on page 2 — HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder (42 CFR Part 2), revocation rights, and re-disclosure warnings. The sensitive information consent is bundled as an all-or-nothing authorization with no opt-out for individual categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Not fillable:** Despite being digitally created, no forms offer interactive fields — a significant missed opportunity.
- **SSN collection:** The last 4 digits of SSN are requested without being marked optional, exceeding what HIPAA requires for patient identification.
- **Sensitive information bundling:** The authorization bundles consent for mental health, HIV/AIDS, and substance use disorder records with no ability to exclude specific categories.
- **Outdated form still live:** Form 3 (undated older version) remains publicly accessible and could lead patients to use a superseded form with a potentially incorrect mailing address.
- **No fees mentioned:** While appropriate for patient access under HIPAA, the absence of any fee information leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart as default delivery:** If no delivery method is specified, records default to the patient's Baptist Health MyChart account — a patient-friendly, electronic-first approach.
- **Package-based record selection:** The tiered Package 1/Package 2 system with clear descriptions simplifies an inherently complex choice.
- **Toll-free phone support:** Contact information includes both local and toll-free numbers, plus a dedicated MyChart support line.
- **15-day turnaround goal:** Proactively commits to a faster-than-required timeline (HIPAA allows 30 days).
- **Multiple delivery options:** Paper, fax, email, CD, and MyChart cover a wide range of patient preferences.

## Overall Assessment

Baptist Health Lexington, through its parent system, provides a competent but conventional records request process. The primary form is well-organized and clearly accommodates patient self-access, but the reliance on a non-fillable PDF and fax/mail submission keeps this firmly in the traditional paper-workflow category. The existence of a dedicated patient access form (Form 2) shows awareness of the distinction, but its outdated status and missing submission instructions undercut its value. The bright spots — MyChart default delivery, helpful tips page, and clear package descriptions — demonstrate patient-centered thinking within the constraints of a legacy form design.
