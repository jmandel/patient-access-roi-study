# AdventHealth Hendersonville — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Hendersonville is a community hospital in western North Carolina, part of the AdventHealth major nonprofit health system. The facility's primary pathway for medical records requests is a **Swellbox/Datavant online eRequest wizard**, linked from a shared system-wide medical records page. No downloadable PDF form specific to AdventHealth Hendersonville exists. The three PDF forms retrieved during the search all belong to other AdventHealth facilities — two from St. Luke's Hospital in Columbus, NC (~40 miles away) and one from Florida Hospital Heartland Division in Sebring, FL.

## Access Pathway Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville's medical records page (accessible via a footer link on the facility homepage) provides phone, fax, and online eRequest options under the "Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina Locations" tab. The **Swellbox/Datavant wizard** at `swellbox.com/adventhealth-mid-wizard.html` is the primary digital pathway for all records requests. This is an online portal approach — a fully digital request workflow that does not require printing, handwriting, or physically delivering a form.

The facility does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the form discovery level; the Swellbox wizard is the single channel for all request types. Whether the wizard itself differentiates internally is unknown from the available materials. Among the sister-facility PDF forms found, form-1 (St. Luke's "Patient Request for Access") does explicitly separate patient self-access from third-party release — but this form is not linked from AdventHealth Hendersonville's pages and belongs to a different facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms for AdventHealth Hendersonville required **moderate effort**. The medical records page was findable through standard website navigation (footer link), and the Swellbox wizard URL was clearly listed. However, multiple web searches for downloadable PDF forms returned only results from sister facilities, and URL-guessing for Hendersonville-specific PDFs returned 404 errors. The shared system-wide medical records page, with its tabbed regional structure, adds a layer of navigation complexity — a patient must identify the correct regional tab and locate their facility within it. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Since no Hendersonville-specific PDF form exists, the best available PDF for assessment is **form-1 (St. Luke's Patient Request for Access)** — a sister facility form from the same Western NC region. This is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) that must be printed and filled by hand. It has a logical top-to-bottom flow covering patient identification, scope selection, format preferences, and delivery method. The language is plain and patient-friendly ("If you would like a copy of your medical record, please complete the form below"). It offers excellent format options (CD, flash drive, email, paper) and delivery methods (mail, secure email, fax, pickup).

However, the form is dated **June 2016**, still uses pre-rebrand "St. Luke's Hospital" branding, includes the Columbus, NC address, and explicitly states "I am a patient of St. Luke's Hospital." A Hendersonville patient using this form would be submitting a request to the wrong facility.

The primary pathway — the Swellbox wizard — is likely a more functional and appropriate tool for Hendersonville patients, but as an external third-party portal, its internal quality could not be assessed from the downloaded materials.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness** required on the sister-facility forms.
- **Fees**: Not mentioned on form-1; form-2 states "A fee may be charged" without specifying amounts; form-3 mentions fees may apply. No fee schedule was found.
- **SSN collection**: Forms request last 4 digits of SSN (form-1 and form-2) or full SSN (form-3), which is unnecessary for patient access.
- **Submission methods**: The Swellbox wizard provides fully online submission. Fax (828-651-4018) and phone (828-681-2135) are also available. No indication that in-person delivery is required.

## Notable Strengths

- **Online portal pathway**: The Swellbox/Datavant wizard offers a fully digital workflow — no printing, scanning, or faxing required.
- **Multiple contact channels**: Phone, fax, and online options are all clearly listed.
- **Sister facility form quality**: Form-1, though not Hendersonville-specific, demonstrates that AdventHealth's regional forms can be well-designed with good format/delivery options.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No facility-specific PDF form**: A patient who prefers or needs a downloadable form has no Hendersonville-specific option.
- **Wrong-facility forms in search results**: PDF forms from other AdventHealth facilities appear in searches, creating confusion risk.
- **Outdated sister-facility forms**: The available PDFs are 7-10 years old with pre-rebrand branding.
- **System-wide page complexity**: The shared medical records page requires patients to navigate regional tabs to find their facility.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville provides an adequate-to-good patient records request experience through its Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, which represents a modern, portal-based approach. The facility scores well on having an electronic submission pathway and multiple contact options. However, the absence of any facility-specific downloadable form, combined with confusing sister-facility PDFs in search results and a somewhat complex system-wide navigation structure, prevents a top-tier rating. The organization's approach is portal-first by design, which works well for digitally comfortable patients but offers no paper-form fallback specific to this facility.

# Myrtue Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Myrtue Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Harlan, Iowa. The organization posts its medical records forms on a dedicated "Authorization + Release Forms" page under the Patients + Visitors section of its website. Two English-language forms were retrieved, along with references to their Spanish translations:

- **form-1.pdf** — "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (the primary ROI form)
- **form-2.pdf** — "Consent for Disclosure" (permission for verbal communication with designated individuals)

Form-1 is the document a patient would use to request copies of their own medical records. Form-2 serves a different purpose — authorizing the facility to discuss a patient's care by phone with family members or caregivers — and is not relevant to the patient self-access use case.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

Myrtue Medical Center does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party seeking authorization for release. Form-1 is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form with a bidirectional "From / To" layout. A patient requesting their own records must check Myrtue in the "From" column and write their own name and address in the "To" column's "Other" field. This works, but the form was clearly designed with third-party release as the primary use case — there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no streamlined self-request pathway, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A site-scoped web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's website provides a clearly labeled forms page reachable within two clicks from the homepage. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or login requirements were encountered. The PDF filenames are descriptive and include language and revision date. The form header includes complete HIM department contact information (phone, fax, and email), giving patients clear channels for questions and submission.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally designed PDF — concise and logically organized with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, from/to routing, record type selection, purpose, delivery method, legal disclosures, and signature. The language is mostly plain, with formal phrasing limited to the legal disclosures at the bottom. Record type options are granular, with appropriate handling of substance use disorder records under 42 CFR Part 2.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being designed in publishing software with 10 fonts and an embedded logo. All checkboxes and text blanks are static graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a missed opportunity — the June 2025 revision could have added interactive form elements with minimal effort.

## Submission and Delivery Options

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: MyChart Portal, mail, encrypted email, and in-person pickup. The inclusion of MyChart Portal and encrypted email is a genuine bright spot for a small rural facility. For form submission, the header lists fax (712-755-2640) and email (medicalrecords@myrtuemedical.org), meaning a patient can submit the completed form electronically. This meets the baseline for adequate electronic access.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required — only the patient or authorized representative signature. Fees are disclosed as subject to "reproduction fees in accordance with federal/state regulations," but no specific amounts are provided, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. The form includes required HIPAA authorization disclosures: right to revoke, no-conditioning statement, re-disclosure warning, and a one-year maximum expiration. However, because the form frames patient access as a § 164.508 authorization rather than a § 164.524 access request, patients may not understand that different fee rules and timelines apply to their own records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish translations available** for both forms — commendable for a small rural Iowa facility
- **MyChart Portal and encrypted email** as delivery options signal a digital-forward approach
- **Substance use disorder carve-out** with 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language reflects careful compliance
- **Recent revision** (June 2025) suggests active form maintenance
- **Single-page design** minimizes patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Myrtue Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with some genuinely progressive features (portal delivery, encrypted email, bilingual availability). However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing place it squarely in the middle tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Riverwood Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Riverwood Healthcare Center is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Aitkin, MN. It maintains a Patient Forms page with multiple release-of-information documents and offers both printable PDF and online JotForm submission options. Three PDF forms were found (from 2015, 2018, and 2025), all general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms for releasing patient information. The organization also uses MyChart (OCHIN) for patient portal access, though this is not positioned as a records request channel on the Patient Forms page.

## Available Forms and Pathways

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3.pdf** (2025), the current "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" linked from the Patient Forms page as the "Printable Form." Two older versions (2018 and 2015) remain publicly accessible at their original WordPress upload URLs but are no longer linked from the main forms page. All three forms share essentially the same structure: patient demographics, release from/to fields, purpose checkboxes, record type selections, sensitive information opt-out, and standard HIPAA authorization language.

Critically, Riverwood also offers **HIPAA-compliant JotForm online submission** (https://hipaa.jotform.com/222405586410046) as an alternative to the printable PDF. This provides a fully digital workflow — no printing, handwriting, or faxing required. A second JotForm for "Consent for Release of Information" and a third for "Permission to Verbally Discuss PHI" are also available. These online options represent a meaningful accessibility advantage over the PDF-only approach.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Riverwood does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three PDF forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for releasing information from one entity to another. A patient requesting their own records must use the same from/to structure intended for third-party transfers — listing themselves in the "Release Information To" field. The "Personal Use" purpose checkbox is available, signaling that self-requests are anticipated, but there is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no statement of patient rights.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A simple web search for Riverwood's ROI form surfaced direct PDF links immediately. The Patient Forms page is accessible in one click from the main site navigation and provides organized links to both printable and online form options. The only concern is that outdated form versions (2015, 2018) remain publicly accessible, meaning a patient arriving via search engine could encounter a superseded form.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a **single-page, digitally composed PDF** with a clean layout, clear section headers, and notably helpful parenthetical plain-language guidance (e.g., "RELEASE INFORMATION FROM (WHO HAS THE INFORMATION YOU WANT RELEASED?)"). This design choice makes the form substantially more approachable than typical legal-style ROI forms.

However, the PDF has **zero fillable fields** — all checkboxes are Unicode characters (☐) rendered as text, not interactive elements. A patient must print and hand-fill the form. The JotForm alternative addresses this gap for patients who find it. The form does not collect Social Security Numbers (an improvement over the 2015 version, which did), and does not require a witness signature (also improved from the 2015 version).

Field count is reasonable at approximately 15–18 fields including demographics, from/to addresses, purpose, date range, record type selections, and signature. The authorization language is standard but dense, packed into two paragraphs with no visual breaks between concepts.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** on the current form — a positive.
- **Fax submission available** (218-927-5319), providing an electronic submission pathway beyond the JotForm.
- **No fees disclosed** on any form — appropriate for the authorization itself, though patients are not informed about potential costs.
- **Sensitive information defaults to release:** The form states "All information regarding chemical dependency will be released unless you restrict by initialing." This opt-out approach for 42 CFR Part 2–protected substance abuse records is the most significant compliance concern.
- **"Guardian" misspelled as "Gaurdian"** on the current form — a minor but unprofessional error.
- **Ambiguous revocation language:** The form requires patients to "present" written revocation to the Medical Records Department, which could be read as requiring in-person delivery.

## Overall Assessment

Riverwood Healthcare Center provides a **competent but undifferentiated** records request experience. The organization earns credit for easy findability, offering both printable and online submission options (via JotForm), and producing a clean single-page form with helpful plain-language guidance. The JotForm option is a genuine bright spot that elevates the digital experience. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the generic authorization form design, the non-fillable PDF, and the concerning opt-out model for sensitive information prevent a higher rating. This is a typical small critical access hospital approach — functional but not patient-centered.

# Community Health Centers of Burlington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Community Health Centers of Burlington (CHCB) provides two downloadable PDF forms for health information disclosure. **Form-1** ("Authorization to Send Health Information," revised November 2023) is the primary ROI form — a one-page, fillable PDF covering medical, mental health/psychiatric, and dental records. **Form-2** ("Authorization for Verbal Communication (Only)") is a companion form limited to verbal disclosures; it explicitly states "No paper records will be sent" and is not relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own records.

No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or web-based form wizard was identified. The primary pathway for a patient requesting records is to download form-1, complete it, and submit it — though submission instructions are notably absent from the form itself.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

CHCB does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization/disclosure form designed to serve all release purposes. However, it includes a "Patient copy" checkbox under "Reason for Release" alongside options like "Coordination of care," "Transfer care," and "Legal purposes." This checkbox normalizes patient self-access as a legitimate use case, even though the form's structure — with "Information REQUESTED FROM" and "Information RELEASED TO" blocks — is oriented toward third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate sender/recipient fields that don't map intuitively to a self-access request, creating potential confusion.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), nor does it include plain-language statements about patient rights to access their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required a site-scoped web search (`site:chcb.org`), which immediately returned a direct link to the PDF in a WordPress uploads directory. The organization's own forms page (`chcb.org/forms/`) did not render content — likely due to JavaScript rendering — meaning a patient navigating the website directly would have difficulty finding the form without resorting to a search engine. No bot-blocking or download difficulties were encountered. Findability is moderate: easily searchable but not prominently surfaced through the site's own navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-executed digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 36 interactive form fields, a clean text layer, and a modest 164 KB file size. The one-page design is impressively compact, covering three record categories (medical, mental health, dental) with date ranges, legal disclosures, and a revocation section. The layout is dense but readable, using bold headers, checkboxes, and horizontal rules to organize content.

Language is a mix of accessible plain English in the record-selection sections and standard legal boilerplate in the disclosure paragraph. The record type options are well-designed — patients can choose complete records or specify particular items, with date ranges available for medical and mental health categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

**No submission instructions.** The most significant gap is the absence of any guidance on how to submit the completed form. The header lists a fax number and email for receiving records *at* CHCB, but there is no explicit instruction for returning the completed authorization. A patient would likely have to call the office to ask. **No fees are mentioned** — neither disclosed nor waived. **No notarization** is required, and the form explicitly states that photocopies and facsimiles are valid, removing a common barrier. The conditioning-of-treatment language is legally accurate but could intimidate patients. A line about verbal communication, apparently carried over from the verbal-only companion form, creates minor confusion about what the form authorizes.

## Notable Strengths

- **"Patient copy" checkbox** explicitly normalizes patient self-access as a standard reason for release
- **One-page fillable PDF** with 36 interactive fields enables complete digital form-filling
- **Photocopy/facsimile acceptance** explicitly stated, removing an access barrier
- **Granular record selection** with date ranges gives patients control over scope
- **Revocation section** clearly states the right to revoke consent at any time

## Overall Assessment

CHCB provides a technically competent, concise authorization form that a patient *can* use to request their own records, but the experience is not designed around patient self-access. The generic disclosure framing, absence of submission instructions, lack of patient rights language, and sender/recipient confusion when used for self-access all point to a form built for provider-to-provider information exchange that accommodates patients as a secondary use case. The fillable design and compact layout are genuine strengths, but the missing submission pathway is a meaningful gap in the patient experience.

# Piedmont Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Piedmont Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Rock Hill, SC, affiliated with Tenet Healthcare. Two authorization forms were found: a one-page hospital-specific form (form-1) and a two-page physician network form (form-2). The organization also contracts with Datavant and offers Swellbox online portals for both patient and provider record requests, which represents the most patient-friendly pathway.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The hospital's "Request Medical Records" page at piedmontmedicalcenter.com/patients/request-medical-records serves as the central hub, linking to: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (form-1), and (2) a Swellbox/Datavant online portal for patient record requests. A second PDF form (form-2) exists on the affiliated Piedmont Physician Network website but is not linked from the hospital's main medical records page.

Form-1 is the primary PDF document for hospital record requests. It is a single-page "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" form (EZ-7003, revised 2013). The Swellbox portal, however, is likely the pathway the organization most actively directs patients toward for digital submission.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither PDF form is a dedicated patient-access form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 does include a "Self" checkbox under the PURPOSE section, acknowledging that a patient may be requesting their own records, but the form's framing ("I authorize Piedmont Medical Center to disclose the following information...") and structure assume a third-party recipient scenario. Form-2 is even more clearly a third-party release form, with fields for "Name of Person or Class of Persons who may disclose" and "To release records to" — a structure that makes no sense for self-access.

The Swellbox portal provides a meaningful alternative. By offering separate portals for patient and provider requests, the organization does create some differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — though this differentiation exists at the portal level, not in the PDF forms themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately returned the medical records page URL and direct PDF links. The medical records page is well-organized and clearly labeled. The only technical hurdle was Cloudflare bot protection blocking automated downloads, requiring browser-based retrieval — a hosting infrastructure issue that could also affect assistive technologies.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1** (primary hospital form) is a non-fillable PDF with zero interactive fields. Despite having labeled fields for patient name, date of birth, address, and various checkboxes for record types, all are static text requiring print-and-fill completion. The form is compact at one page with a logical layout organized into PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION REQUESTED, PURPOSE, and INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO sections. Record type options are granular, with 14+ checkboxes covering specific document types plus a write-in option.

The language is moderately legalistic, particularly the liability release and re-disclosure clauses. Template merge fields (`«PatientNumberBarcode»`, `«PatientName»`, etc.) are visible at the bottom of the public PDF, indicating an unprocessed template extracted from the hospital's document management system — confusing for patients and unprofessional in appearance. A typo ("in ability" for "inability") in the legal representative attestation is concerning for a legal document.

**Form-2** (physician network form) is more comprehensive at two pages but also entirely non-fillable. Its standout feature is granular opt-in checkboxes for seven categories of highly confidential information (mental health, psychotherapy notes, HIV/AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, sexual assault, child abuse/neglect). However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, carries no organizational branding, has a date field locked to "200_" (rendering one term option unusable since 2010), and provides no Privacy Office contact information.

## Barriers and Compliance

Neither form requires notarization or in-person submission. Neither mentions fees. Both include standard HIPAA disclosures: revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warnings. Form-1's six-month default expiration is reasonable. The liability release clause on Form-1 — releasing the hospital "from any legal responsibility or liability" — is unnecessary for patient self-access and could discourage patients from exercising their rights. Both forms are notably outdated (2013 and pre-2010 respectively), predating significant regulatory updates.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** for patient record requests provides a modern digital pathway beyond the paper forms
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear organization and multiple access options
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** (14+ options on form-1) give patients meaningful control
- **Granular sensitive information opt-in** on form-2 (seven separate categories) represents strong practice

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — both PDFs are generic third-party authorization forms
- **Zero fillable fields** on either form — entirely print-and-fill
- **Severely outdated forms** (one from 2013, one from pre-2010)
- **Visible template merge fields** on form-1 indicate an unprocessed internal template
- **SSN requested** on form-2 (unnecessary privacy risk)
- **Liability release clause** on form-1 (inappropriate for patient self-access)

## Overall Assessment

Piedmont Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional patient records request experience. The organization's investment in a Swellbox/Datavant online portal significantly improves the digital pathway, compensating for PDF forms that are entirely paper-oriented and outdated. The medical records page is easy to find and well-organized. However, the underlying PDF forms show their age — neither has been updated in over a decade, neither offers fillable fields, and neither is designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. The organization earns a B grade, buoyed by the portal alternative and reasonable findability, but held back by paper-era form design and a generic authorization approach that doesn't center patient access rights.

# Tioga Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Tioga Medical Center, a small independent critical access hospital in Tioga, North Dakota, offers a single ROI form: an "Authorization for Release of Medical/Confidential Information" available from its Health Information Management (HIM) page at https://www.tiogahealth.org/him. The form is provided in both PDF and Word (.docx) formats. No patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form exists. The only submission options apparent from the form are fax (701-664-2646) and mail (P.O. Box 159, Tioga, ND 58852).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Tioga Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form uses a "Release From" / "Release To" structure that assumes records are moving between facilities or to a third party — not to the patient themselves. A patient requesting their own records would need to awkwardly list themselves in the "Release To" field, navigating a paradigm that was never designed for them. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no dedicated patient access pathway, and no guidance on how patients requesting their own records should complete the form. This is a textbook example of the "wrong form" problem: the organization funnels all requesters through a generic authorization form built for inter-institutional disclosure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the HIM page, and the form is directly linked with no login required. For a small critical access hospital, this represents reasonable discoverability. The only minor issue is that the download URL is a Wix-generated hash path that gives no indication of the document's content, and the HIM page provides little context about when or why a patient would use this form.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is an **image-only scan** — a CCITT fax-encoded grayscale image at 200 DPI with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers and fails basic digital accessibility standards. A patient must print the form and fill it out by hand. The availability of a Word (.docx) version partially mitigates this: a patient with Microsoft Word could type into the document, but this depends on having compatible software and the initiative to seek out the alternative format.

The form itself is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, release-from/to facility information, date range, purpose checkboxes (6 options), record type checkboxes (12 categories), sensitive records authorization, and signature lines. The 12 checkbox categories for record types — from emergency room records to clinic notes — provide genuinely useful granularity. However, a dense legal paragraph at the bottom covers revocation rights, insurance implications, and re-disclosure warnings in a single unbroken block with no visual emphasis on key patient rights.

## Barriers and Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — while not explicitly marked as required, its presence as a structured field implies it is expected. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests, and this could deter patients who lack someone available to witness. The form mentions no fees, states no response timeline, and provides no delivery format options (electronic, CD, mail). An internal tracking sidebar ("Records given □ / Number of Pages / Initials") sits unlabeled among patient-facing fields, creating potential confusion.

## Strengths

Despite its limitations, the form has some positive elements: a clear voluntariness statement ("I can refuse to sign this authorization. I need not sign this form in order to assure treatment"), explicit revocation rights, a reasonable six-month authorization window, and granular record-type selection. The dual-format availability (PDF + Word) shows some awareness of accessibility needs, even if the execution is lacking.

## Overall Assessment

Tioga Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request process that reflects the resource constraints typical of small independent critical access hospitals. The form is easy to find and covers the basics, but it is technically primitive (image-only scan), not designed for patient self-access, and includes a potentially unnecessary witness requirement. A patient could navigate this process, but they would need to print the form, handwrite their information, figure out that they belong in the "Release To" field, and fax or mail it back. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate findability cannot fully compensate for poor technical accessibility and a form paradigm that treats patient self-access as an afterthought.

# Fenway Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fenway Health, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Boston, MA, provides a cohesive three-document records-release package: an English ROI authorization form (form-1), a companion FAQ guide (form-2), and a Spanish translation of the ROI form (form-3). The forms are easy to find, submission channels are plentiful, and the organization demonstrates genuine care for its patient population through thoughtful design choices — but it does not offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway, instead routing all records requests through a generic third-party authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

The primary form is titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" and is structured around a FROM/TO model: "I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM: Sender/Facility's name... TO: Recipient/Facility's name." This framing is designed for provider-to-provider transfers — a patient wanting their own records must write their personal name and address into the "Recipient/Facility's name" field, which is unintuitive. There is no checkbox for "send records to me" and no separate patient access form. The organization does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization.

Fenway Health also offers MyChart patient portal access, which provides a separate digital pathway, but the downloadable form itself is firmly a generic authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Fenway Health's forms was straightforward — a simple web search immediately returned the PDF URL and the dedicated medical records page at fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was needed. The organization maintains a clean, dedicated medical records landing page with clear submission instructions. This is a best-case retrieval scenario.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a clean text layer and 7 fonts — clearly designed with care in a layout tool. However, it contains zero fillable fields, which is a significant missed opportunity. Despite being digitally created, patients must print, hand-fill, and then scan or fax the form. The layout follows a logical 7-section flow (patient info → sender → recipient → reason → record type → sensitive info → signature) and fits on one page, though the density is notable. The legal notice in Section 7 is a single 130-word block mixing authorization scope, revocation rights, reproductive health protections, and substance abuse protections — challenging to parse.

Section 6 (Sensitive Information) stands out: it requires individual patient initials for 10 categories of sensitive health information, including abortion care, gender-affirming care, HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, and substance use treatment. This granularity gives patients unusually fine-grained control over disclosure.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fenway Health imposes no unreasonable barriers. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person mandate, and no fees mentioned. Submission channels include mail, fax, email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org), and MyChart portal — four pathways, all adequate for remote submission. The form clearly states revocation rights and a one-year authorization validity period. Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (in the FAQ sheet), well within HIPAA's 30-day requirement. The sensitive information initials requirement, while thorough, could function as a processing delay trigger if patients skip it — the bold warning "COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING" has a somewhat coercive tone.

## Notable Strengths

Fenway Health's standout feature is the companion FAQ sheet (form-2) — a 3-page plain-language guide that walks patients through every section of the ROI form, defining terms like "bi-directional" and "abstract" that would otherwise be opaque. Very few healthcare organizations create separate instructional documents for their ROI forms. The Spanish-language form (form-3) demonstrates commitment to language access, though no Spanish FAQ exists. The inclusion of Massachusetts-specific shield-law language protecting reproductive health and gender-affirming care records reflects both legal compliance and organizational mission. The "Name used (if different)" field thoughtfully accommodates patients whose current name differs from their legal name.

## Weaknesses

The most significant weakness is the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway. The FROM/TO structure is designed for third-party release and does not clearly serve a patient requesting their own records. The lack of fillable fields on a born-digital PDF is a technical oversight that forces an unnecessary print-handwrite-scan workflow. The Spanish form's contact block reverts to English ("Mail/Fax to:", "Attn: Medical Records Dept"), undermining the translation effort.

## Overall Assessment

Fenway Health earns a solid B. The organization demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its FAQ guide, multilingual forms, and sensitive information protections, but falls short on the two key assessment dimensions: it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, and its form is not digitally fillable despite being born-digital. A patient can successfully request their records through this process, but the form was not designed with that use case as a first-class concern.

# Consensus Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Consensus Health operates as a decentralized network of independent physician practices in New Jersey. Four documents were retrieved, but none is a dedicated patient records request form. The most relevant document for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf**, a generic, unbranded one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN — not on any Consensus Health website. The remaining three documents are Consensus Health–branded intake paperwork from Skylands Medical Group (a member practice): a general consent/disclosure/authorization form (form-2), a HIPAA acknowledgment (form-3), and a seven-page Notice of Privacy Practices (form-4). None of these serves as a patient-initiated records request mechanism.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Consensus Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The only ROI-adjacent form (form-1) is framed entirely as a third-party disclosure authorization — its language ("authorize the disclosure of information from my health record" to a named "Person/Organization/Facility") assumes records are being sent to someone other than the patient. There is no form, process, or web page designed for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The organization appears to direct patients to the athenahealth patient portal or to contact the office by phone, but no documented ROI workflow exists through either channel.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any relevant form was **extremely difficult**. The main Consensus Health website has no patient forms section. Extensive searching — direct navigation, URL guessing across multiple paths, site-specific searches, and PDF filetype searches — produced nothing. The generic ROI form was only found through a general web search linking to a PatientPop-hosted PDF loosely associated with Consensus Health practices. The Consensus Health–branded documents were discovered on a member practice's WordPress site (Skylands Medical Group), not on any Consensus Health–owned domain. A patient visiting consensushealth.com would find no path to an ROI form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available ROI document, is a bare-bones single-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects approximately 11 fields (patient name, record number, address, DOB, free-text information requested, free-text purpose, recipient name/address/phone, and signature/date). The layout is plain and functional, and the language is reasonably clear. However, the form is critically incomplete: it provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or any indication of where to send the completed form. It carries no organizational branding, so a patient cannot confirm it belongs to their provider. A patient completing this form would have no idea what to do with it.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No submission pathway**: The form provides zero information about how to submit it — a functional barrier that effectively renders the form unusable without outside knowledge.
- **Missing HIPAA-required authorization elements**: The form lacks an expiration date, revocation language, and the name of the disclosing entity — elements required under 45 CFR § 164.508(c) for a valid authorization.
- **"Record Number" field**: The form asks for a medical record number without explaining where the patient would find this.
- **Vague fee language**: The NPP (form-4) mentions "reasonable fees" for copies but provides no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **"Proprietary & Confidential" marking** on the NPP — an odd designation for a document HIPAA requires to be publicly available.

## Notable Strengths

- The **Notice of Privacy Practices** (form-4) is substantive and current (Version 2.0, 2025), including reproductive health care protections reflecting the 2024 HIPAA Final Rule and explicit acknowledgment of patients' right to electronic access.
- The NPP states a **30-day response commitment** for records requests, aligning with HIPAA standards.
- The consent form (form-2) has a well-designed **authorized individuals section** with granular health/payment disclosure options and a detailed **contact preferences** section.

## Overall Assessment

Consensus Health presents a significant challenge for patients seeking their own medical records online. The organization has no centralized patient forms infrastructure, no dedicated records request form, and no documented electronic submission pathway. The only ROI-adjacent form found is an unbranded, non-fillable, third-party authorization template that lacks essential information for a patient to act on it. While the athenahealth patient portal may offer an alternative pathway, this is not documented or promoted as a records request mechanism. The decentralized practice model means patients at different member practices may have different (and equally opaque) experiences. This organization's approach to patient records access is best characterized as an afterthought — not hostile, but functionally absent from its public-facing digital presence.

# Synthesis: Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers

## Overview

Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers (Philadelphia, PA) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC historically focused on HIV/AIDS care. The organization maintains a well-organized "Forms and Consents" page on its website with direct PDF download links, offering forms in both English and Spanish. Two ROI-related forms were found: a dedicated patient access form (form-1) and a separate third-party authorization form (form-2).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Philadelphia FIGHT stands out by maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access and third-party release** — a best practice that many larger organizations fail to implement. Form-1, titled "Patient Request for Access to Information," is explicitly designed for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524). It opens with a clear rights statement and deals exclusively with the patient's own records. Form-2, the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Information," is a standard § 164.508 authorization for third-party disclosures. This structural separation means patients requesting their own records are not funneled through a generic authorization workflow designed for insurers, attorneys, or other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Forms and Consents page is accessible via the main navigation (About → Forms and Consents) and was surfaced quickly by a site-specific web search. Direct PDF download links with descriptive text ("Request for Access to Information Form") made identification easy. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or other technical obstacles were encountered. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-fill or PDF annotation workarounds. This is a meaningful gap given that the form was clearly authored digitally (7 fonts, embedded logo) and could easily have been made interactive.

The form's structure follows a logical flow: patient identification, scope of request (entire medical record, billing record, or specific records), access method (copy vs. inspection), format preference (paper or electronic with a "Specify" field), delivery method (pick up or mail), and requester identification (self, guardian, or representative). At one page, it is appropriately concise.

The language is moderately complex. The introductory paragraph front-loads legal information about timelines, fees, and denial rights in dense prose. While accurate, it could be more accessible if broken into bullet points. The form does not use explicit section headers beyond the internal-use divider.

## Submission Methods

Form-1 lists four submission channels: in-person, email (privacy@fight.org), fax (215-732-1145), and mail. The inclusion of **email submission** is a notable strength — many organizations limit submission to fax and mail. A patient can complete and submit the form without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **Fee language is vague**: The form describes four categories of chargeable costs (labor, supplies, postage, summary preparation) but provides no dollar amounts, fee schedule, or cost estimates. Costs are billed after fulfillment, with no mechanism for a patient to learn the cost in advance or set a spending limit.
- **No mention of right to appeal a denial**: The form states FIGHT may deny access but does not inform the patient of their right to request review of a denial, which HIPAA requires for reviewable denials under § 164.524(d)(4).
- **Response timeline stated**: 30 days, with possible 60-day extension — consistent with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **Email submission option** in addition to fax, mail, and in-person — a low-barrier digital channel.
- **Electronic format option** with an open "Specify" field, respecting the patient's right to choose format.
- **Adolescent self-access at age 13+**, reflecting Pennsylvania minor consent law.
- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) on the Forms and Consents page.
- **Sensitive information opt-out** on the third-party form, with granular categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) — especially relevant for this organization's patient population.

## Overall Assessment

Philadelphia FIGHT delivers an above-average patient access experience among FQHCs. The structural decision to separate patient access from third-party authorization is the standout feature, demonstrating clear understanding of HIPAA's distinct provisions. The form is concise, logically organized, and offers multiple submission channels including email. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a print-and-fill workflow), vague fee disclosures, and the omission of denial appeal rights. With relatively modest improvements — adding fillable fields and clarifying fees — this organization could achieve an excellent rating.

# Boone County Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Boone County Health Center (BCHC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Albion, Nebraska. The organization provides a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests — there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway. Three documents were found: the current ROI form (form-2), a superseded 2017 version (form-1), and a HIPAA Contact Information form (form-3) that is explicitly not an ROI substitute.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The primary and only ROI form is form-2, "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information," uploaded in February 2026 as a Microsoft Word .docx file. This replaced an older PDF version (form-1, August 2017) that remains accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the website. The current form is a generic authorization that handles both outbound release ("Release Information To") and inbound record requests ("Obtain Records From") through a single check-one mechanism. While a "Patient Request" purpose checkbox exists, the form does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party authorization, and makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — basic web searches surfaced both the old and new versions, and the current form is listed on the Patient Forms section under Patient Resources > General Information. The main complication is that the current form is published only as a .docx file, which is unusual and less accessible than PDF. The website also requires JavaScript rendering to display form links. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page document with a logical flow: patient identification, release direction, purpose, date range, record types, sensitive information authorization, delivery format, legal acknowledgments, and signatures. It has zero fillable fields — all inputs are underscore blank lines, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The .docx format theoretically allows typing, but without proper form fields the experience is poor.

The layout is reasonably organized with clear sections, though the release direction framing ("Release Information To" vs. "Obtain Records From") is confusing for patients who simply want their own records. The sensitive information section has garbled instruction text from formatting issues. Language is generally plain and accessible, with concise legal acknowledgments. There are no instructions explaining how to submit the completed form, though the header provides phone, fax, and a dedicated ROI email address (Roi@boonecohealth.org).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is required. Fee disclosure is vague — the form states "copy fees may apply in accordance with Nebraska law" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access and third-party fees. A photo ID/witness requirement appears on the signature line but its scope is ambiguous — it may apply only to in-person pickup. The form includes a proper non-coercion statement, re-disclosure warning, 12-month fixed expiration, and revocation rights. No turnaround time is stated. A typo ("Heath" instead of "Health") appears in the legal section.

Submission methods include fax (402-395-2180), potentially email (Roi@boonecohealth.org is listed but not explicitly stated as a submission channel), mail, and in-person delivery. Fax availability means electronic submission is possible without visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

BCHC shows several bright spots unusual for a small critical access hospital: a dedicated ROI email address suggesting a staffed intake process, encrypted email as a delivery format option, and careful handling of sensitive information categories with separate initials required for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV/AIDS records per Nebraska law. The form is compact (2 pages) and avoids excessive legalese.

## Notable Weaknesses

The .docx-only publication format is a meaningful accessibility barrier. The lack of fillable fields means this is fundamentally a paper workflow. The generic authorization framing without any acknowledgment of patient access rights under HIPAA means a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for third-party release. The continued availability of the superseded 2017 form at its original URL creates confusion risk.

## Overall Assessment

Boone County Health Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is findable and the content is adequate, but it reflects a traditional paper-centric approach with no digital-first design or patient access differentiation. The bright spots — dedicated email, encrypted delivery, compact design — show genuine effort, but the .docx format, lack of fillable fields, and generic authorization framing hold back the overall experience. A patient can get the job done, but must figure out the process largely on their own.

# UF Health Shands Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UF Health Shands Hospital, a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Gainesville, Florida, offers patients a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all record requests. Four versions of this form (form family PS46283/RI0001) were found online, but only one — form-2.pdf, revised 5/30/19 — is linked from the official medical records page. No dedicated patient self-access pathway exists; patients requesting their own records use the same authorization form designed for third-party release.

## Forms and Pathways

The primary form (form-2.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF linked from ufhealth.org/medical-records. Three additional variants persist online: form-1.pdf (a 2015 revision with more detailed identity verification and numbered sections), form-3.pdf (a 2014 legacy version with a liability waiver and HealthPort electronic delivery), and form-4.pdf (a clinic-specific variant pre-filled for the Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment). All share the same form code and general structure. The coexistence of multiple undifferentiated versions at different URLs creates a risk that patients or providers encounter outdated forms via search engines.

Submission options are mail and fax, both clearly printed on form-2. The medical records page also lists a phone number. An in-person pick-up option is noted on the form. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway per the scoring baseline.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UF Health Shands does **not** offer a differentiated patient self-access pathway. The form is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — the HIPAA authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than the Right of Access framework (§ 164.524). The sole accommodation for patients requesting their own records is a small "Check here if same as patient" checkbox in the "To" field. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, does not distinguish fee structures for patient access versus third-party release, and does not include any language framing the request as an individual access right.

That said, the form does include "Personal Use" as an explicit purpose option, and the identity verification fields in the representative section are marked "Internal use only," appropriately sparing patients from producing documentation at the time of form completion.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a cleanly designed, born-digital single-page PDF — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally composed (8 fonts, no embedded images, only 95 KB), the form requires printing and handwriting. This is a persistent gap across all four form versions, suggesting an organizational decision rather than a legacy issue.

The layout is logical: patient demographics → from/to routing → facility selection → record types → dates/purpose/format → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. Sixteen record-type checkboxes (including separated sensitive-information categories for behavioral health, substance use disorder, STD/HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing) provide excellent granularity. The legal disclosure section uses reasonably clear language with helpful parentheticals (e.g., "revoke it in writing (i.e., tell UF Health to cancel it)"), though the opening corporate entity definition paragraph is dense legalese.

Delivery format options include MyUFHealth (the patient portal), CD, and paper — the portal option is a notable modern addition, though it serves as a delivery mechanism rather than a request submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization, witness signatures, or in-person submission is required. Authorization expires after one year with clear revocation rights. However, the fee disclosure — "up to $1.00 per page (plus applicable tax and handling) for Paper Records" — is applied uniformly without distinguishing patient access from third-party release. For patient self-access under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4), HIPAA limits fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts; the $1.00/page rate (reflecting Florida's statutory schedule for third-party releases) may exceed this standard. No response time commitment is stated.

The older form-3 includes a liability waiver ("I hereby release and discharge UF Health...from any liability"), which is an additional barrier not present in the current primary form.

## Overall Assessment

UF Health Shands provides an easily findable, well-organized, and compact authorization form, but falls short in two critical areas: (1) the complete absence of fillable PDF fields forces a paper-based workflow, and (2) the generic authorization framework fails to differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The fee language, while standard for Florida third-party releases, is potentially non-compliant when applied to patient access requests. The form earns credit for its granular record-type selection, explicit "Personal Use" purpose option, MyUFHealth portal delivery, and patient-friendly touches like marking verification fields as internal-use-only — but these bright spots don't compensate for the fundamental lack of a patient-centered access pathway and the print-and-handwrite workflow.

# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center provides three downloadable documents, but only one is relevant for patient self-access: **form-3.pdf**, the current "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (CONS00337, dated LRH 01/22). This single-page PDF is linked from the organization's [Medical Records page](https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/) and is the actively maintained ROI form. An older version of the same form (form-1.pdf, dated 04/16) remains publicly accessible at a separate URL but is no longer linked from the site. The third document (form-2.pdf) is an LRH Physicians Group Release/Authorization Form — a multi-purpose intake/consent bundle covering insurance assignment, billing, and treatment consent — and is not a patient-initiated records request form.

In addition to the PDF form, the organization offers a **Swellbox digital intake wizard** (http://www.swellbox.com/lakeland-wizard.html) as an alternative electronic pathway, which is a meaningful digital option for patients who prefer not to deal with paper.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lakeland Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (form-3) is a generic HIPAA authorization with bidirectional language — "to disclose my PHI to" and "to obtain my PHI from" — using checkboxes for each direction. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should check "to disclose my PHI to" and enter their own name and address as the recipient, an unintuitive workflow. There is no dedicated patient access form, no simplified request pathway, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). The form treats patient self-access identically to third-party release, including applying the same fee structure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Lakeland Regional Health medical records release form returned direct PDF links immediately, and the Medical Records page is straightforward to locate via site navigation. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor concern is that the superseded 2016 version remains publicly accessible without any "outdated" marking, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-3) is a **clean, digitally-authored single-page PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is logical and reasonably organized, flowing from patient identification through recipient details, date range, delivery method, record type checkboxes (13 categories plus "Other"), sensitive information notice, five legal clauses, and signature blocks. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — the numbered "I understand that..." clauses are reasonably accessible, though the fee reference to Florida statutes without disclosing actual amounts is opaque.

Three delivery options are offered: Paper, Electronic (email), and MyChart Patient Portal — a forward-thinking inclusion. The form provides granular record-type selection with 13 specific categories, and includes a patient-protective redaction option for mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records.

## Barriers

**Fee disclosure** is a notable weakness: patients must "agree to pay charges... per Florida Statute 395.3025 or Florida Administrative Code 64B8-10.003" without knowing what those charges are. This state fee schedule reference may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests, and the form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release fee structures.

A **witness signature line** appears on the form without clear indication of whether it is required or optional. If required, this creates a logistical barrier for patients completing the form at home or remotely. The form also collects the **last four digits of SSN**, which is unnecessary when MRN, name, DOB, and address are already requested. A "Photo ID verified" checkbox is ambiguous — if interpreted as requiring in-person ID presentation, it could conflict with electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Swellbox digital intake** provides a fully electronic alternative pathway
- **MyChart Patient Portal** as a delivery option leverages existing infrastructure
- **Granular record-type selection** (13 categories) gives patients meaningful control
- **Sensitive information redaction option** with explicit notice is a patient-protective feature
- **Single-page conciseness** keeps the form efficient and reduces patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Lakeland Regional Health provides a **serviceable but undifferentiated** records request experience. The form is easy to find, concise, and reasonably well-organized, with some genuinely patient-friendly features (granular record selection, redaction option, MyChart delivery). However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access, failing to disclose fees, and including potentially unnecessary requirements (witness, partial SSN). The availability of Swellbox as a digital alternative partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF, but the core form experience remains paper-first. The organization earns credit for accessibility and findability but loses ground on patient-centeredness and compliance nuances.

# Nevada Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Nevada Health Centers (NHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Carson City, NV. The organization publishes three ROI-related forms on a well-organized patient forms page. All three are bilingual English/Spanish PDFs created in Adobe Illustrator, and none have fillable fields or an extractable text layer. The primary form for patient self-access is a general-purpose "Release of Medical Information" authorization — there is no dedicated patient access request form.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved from the forms page at `nevadahealthcenters.org/forms/`:

1. **Form-1** — "Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). This is the primary general-purpose release form, covering both patient-initiated requests and third-party releases via a "To/From" checkbox. It is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.
2. **Form-2** — "Authorization to Share Information" (2 pages, bilingual EN/ES). This is a proxy access designation form allowing patients to authorize family or friends to access information on their behalf. It does *not* serve patient self-access.
3. **Form-3** — "WIC Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). A WIC program-specific variant of Form-1, listing seven WIC clinic locations. Structurally identical to Form-1 with added clinic details.

The organization directs completed forms to its Support Services Department in Las Vegas. Fax numbers appear on the forms (and specifically on Form-3's clinic listings), and a mailing address is provided on Form-1. No online portal, email submission, or patient portal-based records request was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NHC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Form-1 uses a single "To or From" directional checkbox to handle both scenarios. A patient requesting their own records would check "To" (themselves) and provide their own contact information in the recipient fields — but the form's language and structure are oriented toward third-party release, asking for a recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524, the Right of Access, or any patient rights language beyond revocation rights. The form requires a "Reason for Request" (with options including "Personal"), which HIPAA does not require for patient self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **relatively easy**. A site-scoped search (`site:nevadahealthcenters.org`) identified the forms page within 2–3 steps. The page is well-organized by category (General Forms, Dental Forms, Mammovan Forms, etc.) with clearly labeled PDF links. However, generic web searches did not surface NHC-specific forms — results returned other Nevada healthcare organizations instead. A patient would need to navigate directly to the NHC website to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a clean, single-page design that packs bilingual content, multiple checkbox sections, and a signature block into a reasonably organized layout. The top-to-bottom flow is logical: patient identification → direction of release → record types → date range → confidential information → reason → signature.

However, significant technical and design issues undermine usability:

- **No fillable fields and no text layer**: All three PDFs were created in Adobe Illustrator with text rendered as vector paths. They have zero extractable text, zero embedded fonts, and zero interactive fields. Screen readers cannot read them, text cannot be copied or searched, and every field must be hand-filled after printing. This is an especially unfortunate choice because the documents are born-digital (not scans) — a word processor or PDF form tool would have preserved accessibility.
- **No "All Records" checkbox**: The form offers six specific record categories plus "Other" but lacks an option to request a complete record. A patient exercising their Right of Access to their full designated record set must check every box and potentially write additional categories.
- **Ambiguous witness line**: The signature block includes a "Witness" field without indicating whether it is required or optional, potentially creating a perceived barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **Inline bilingual compression**: English and Spanish share space on a single page, which keeps things concise but subordinates the Spanish text and reduces whitespace.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers**: No notarization is required. No fees are mentioned (neither disclosed nor explicitly waived). The 120-day default expiration is reasonable but on the shorter side. The witness field ambiguity is a minor concern. The primary barriers are technical: the completely non-digital workflow (print, handwrite, fax/mail) and the inaccessible PDF format.

**Bright spots**: The bilingual English/Spanish design across all three forms is a genuine strength for this FQHC's patient population. The granular confidential information opt-in/opt-out section (AIDS/HIV, behavioral health, alcohol/drug, social services) gives patients meaningful control over sensitive categories. The single-page form length is appropriately concise.

## Overall Assessment

Nevada Health Centers provides a findable, bilingual, concisely designed release form that a patient *can* use to request their own records — but the process was not designed with patient self-access in mind. The generic authorization form, the print-only workflow, and the complete lack of digital accessibility represent a paper-era approach that creates unnecessary friction. The organization earns credit for easy findability and inclusive bilingual design, but loses ground on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness. Overall grade: **C**.

# Wayne County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Monticello, Kentucky. The facility provides a single one-page form for patients requesting their own medical records, along with a parallel web-based HTML form that captures equivalent information online. For a small rural hospital, the availability of dual pathways — PDF and online — is notably progressive.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Only one downloadable PDF was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." This is a patient-access-oriented form, not a generic third-party authorization. The title and structure center on patient self-access, with "self" listed first among record-ownership options (self, child, other). The hospital also offers a web-based HTML form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` that collects equivalent information and allows electronic submission — a genuinely useful alternative to the print-and-deliver workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Wayne County Hospital does a better-than-average job distinguishing patient self-access from third-party release. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" rather than "Authorization for Release of Information," and the patient is addressed directly as the expected user. However, the same single form is used for all requesters — self, child, or other — with no separate instructions or additional authorization requirements for third-party requests. There is no dedicated third-party release form, which means the form functions as a blended instrument, though its default orientation is clearly toward patient access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted web search. The form lives at `/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf` — a media library path that is not linked from any navigable page on the hospital website. The HIM department page provides a phone number but no form download link. There is no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. A patient browsing the website would likely not discover the PDF without calling HIM or using a search engine. The web-based form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` may be more discoverable through site navigation, though this was not confirmed. Retrieval difficulty is moderate — not hard, but requiring search engine assistance rather than intuitive site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable single page. It has a text layer (not a scan) and uses only three fonts, but all fields are represented as underscore blanks — a print-and-handwrite design. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → request type and delivery method → record ownership → dates of service → specific records requested (10 checkboxes) → reason for request → identification presented → signatures. The language is plain and accessible with no legalese. One page is an appropriate length for this type of request.

Delivery options are strong: fax, email, mail, and pick-up. Email as a delivery option is uncommon at critical access hospitals and reduces barriers for rural patients who may live far from the facility.

## Barriers & Compliance Concerns

**Witness requirement:** The form includes a separate "Witness" signature line. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access requests, and this creates a meaningful barrier — a patient filling out the form at home must find a witness before submitting. This is particularly burdensome for rural and isolated patients.

**Reason for request:** The form asks patients to check a reason (Continuity of Care, Personal Interest, Insurance Claims Processing, Legal Claims Processing, Other) without indicating this is optional. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not justify their request.

**Submission method not specified on PDF:** The form itself does not state where or how to return it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is printed on the document. However, the existence of the web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` provides a clear electronic submission pathway.

**Fee transparency:** The form prominently states "Based on KRS 422.317 a first copy of a patient's record will be provided free, subsequent copies may be charged." This Kentucky-law-based disclosure of free first copies is unusually transparent for a facility of this size.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dual pathway (PDF + web form):** Offering both a downloadable PDF and an online web form is exceptional for a 25-bed critical access hospital.
- **Free-copy disclosure on the form itself:** Citing KRS 422.317 about free first copies directly on the form is a bright spot few larger organizations match.
- **Email delivery option:** Including email alongside fax, mail, and pick-up is forward-thinking.
- **One-page brevity:** No unnecessary legal boilerplate — approachable and quick to complete.

## Overall Assessment

Wayne County Hospital demonstrates a patient-centered approach that exceeds expectations for its size and setting. The form is clearly designed for patient self-access, the language is plain, and the availability of an online web form and email delivery are genuine differentiators. The main weaknesses are the witness signature requirement (a real barrier with no legal basis for patient access requests), the unfindability of the PDF on the website, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF. Despite these issues, the overall pathway is solid — a patient can submit their request electronically via the web form, receive records by email, and pay nothing for a first copy.

# Lankenau Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lankenau Medical Center is part of **Main Line Health**, a regional nonprofit health system in suburban Philadelphia. The facility does not publish its own records request form; instead, it uses a system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form managed centrally by Main Line Health. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URLs on mainlinehealth.org — form-1.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0621, June 2021) with 41 fillable fields and interactive buttons, and form-2.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0325, March 2025) as a flat, non-interactive PDF with zero fillable fields. Both are 2-page documents with identical content structure.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed to serve all disclosure purposes — release to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. That said, Main Line Health does include **"Patient personal use"** as an explicit purpose checkbox, which is a positive accommodation. However, the form's framing remains disclosure-oriented: it asks the patient to specify "This information is to be disclosed to: Name of Person or Institution," meaning a patient requesting their own records must somewhat awkwardly write their own name as the disclosure recipient. There is no separate, streamlined pathway for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A straightforward web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No bot blocking, authentication, or patient portal login was required. The form is prominently published on the Main Line Health website. The only minor friction is that two versions coexist at different URLs without any clear indication of which is current — a patient could inadvertently download the older fillable version or the newer flat version.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing based on **form-1.pdf** (the fillable version, which provides the better patient experience):

- **Fillable fields**: Yes — 41 interactive fields plus PRINT, SAVE AS, EMAIL, and RESET action buttons. The EMAIL button suggests the form can be completed and submitted entirely digitally. This is genuinely digital-first design.
- **Layout**: Clean and logically organized — facility selection → patient ID → date range → record types → sensitive information → recipient → purpose → delivery → expiration → signatures, with a full instructions page on the reverse.
- **Language**: A mix of plain and legal language. The rights acknowledgment paragraphs are substantive but dense. Instructions on page 2 are clear and well-structured.
- **Instructions**: Thorough. Numbered instructions cover completion requirements, submission methods (fax, email, mail, walk-in), a delivery options matrix by recipient type, fee information, and detailed signing authority guidance for minors, incapacitated patients, and deceased patients under PA law.
- **Delivery options**: Exceptionally strong — six options including encrypted USB, MyChart portal, printed paper (pick-up or mail), fax, and encrypted email/third-party portal. A clear table shows availability by recipient type.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Prepayment language**: The instructions state "payment will be expected prior to the records being delivered," which could function as a barrier to patient access. Under HIPAA, covered entities should not condition record delivery on prepayment in a way that creates unreasonable barriers.
- **Witness line ambiguity**: A "(Signature of Witness)" field is present but the form does not clarify whether a witness is required, potentially confusing patients completing the form at home.
- **Fee amounts undisclosed**: The form references fees "in accordance with Federal and PA State Law" but does not specify amounts, leaving patients uncertain about costs.
- **No notarization required**: Correct — the form does not impose this unnecessary barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Excellent delivery options** with encrypted electronic formats and a clear availability matrix
- **Fillable PDF** with embedded action buttons (form-1 version)
- **"Patient personal use" checkbox** that normalizes self-access requests
- **Detailed signing authority guidance** reflecting PA-specific law
- **Sensitive information opt-in** with separate checkboxes for HIV, psychiatric, and substance abuse records
- **HIPAA-compliant response timelines** clearly stated (30/60 days with 30-day extension)

## Overall Assessment

Main Line Health provides an above-average records request experience for Lankenau Medical Center patients. The form is easy to find, technically well-executed (in its fillable version), and offers unusually comprehensive delivery options. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic third-party disclosure form and adapt it to their own needs. The prepayment language and undisclosed fee amounts are minor compliance concerns. Overall, this represents a solid **B-grade** experience: a patient can accomplish their goal, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

MUSC Health provides five documents related to medical records release: the current English authorization form (form-1, Rev. 10/2023, 2 pages), an older superseded version (form-2, Version 11, dated 11/2017), a dental-specific variant (form-3, Version 9, dated 5/2019), a MyChart instructions guide (form-4, 4 pages, dated 2017), and a Spanish translation of the current form (form-5). The primary form for patient self-access is form-1, the current "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information."

Critically, MUSC offers three distinct request pathways clearly presented on its medical records page: (1) MyChart Patient Portal for existing portal users, (2) an online eRequest wizard via Ciox/Swellbox for fully digital submission, and (3) manual form download for traditional mail/fax/email submission. This multi-pathway approach gives patients genuine flexibility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MUSC does differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — but at the process level, not the form level. The MyChart instructions document (form-4) explicitly states that MyChart is for patient self-requests, while the HIPAA authorization form should be used "for medical records to be sent directly to a physician office, hospital or third parties." The medical records webpage reinforces this distinction through its tabbed layout.

However, the downloadable PDF form itself (form-1) is a generic HIPAA authorization serving all purposes. "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" is listed as one purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care," "Legal," "Insurance," and others. The form does not distinguish the legal basis, fee structure, or processing rules for patient access under 45 CFR §164.524 versus third-party authorization — even though it cites that regulation. A patient using only the form must navigate a document designed around the third-party release paradigm.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability is excellent. The medical records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and all three pathways are clearly presented. Web searches for MUSC records release forms return direct PDF links. No bot-blocking or access difficulties were encountered. The form URLs are descriptive and intuitive. Both English and Spanish versions are co-located under a clearly labeled section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-authored, text-layered PDF with clean layout and logical flow: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Record Types → SUD Records → Purpose → Date Range → Release Method → Authorization/Consent → Signature. At two pages, the length is appropriate — page one handles all authorization substance, page two provides a useful facility contact directory for nine MUSC Health locations across South Carolina.

The most significant technical shortcoming is that the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being revised in October 2023. Patients must print the PDF and handwrite all entries, then fax, scan-and-email, or mail the completed form. This is a missed opportunity for a major academic medical center's current-revision document.

Record type options are granular and well-designed, including a dedicated Substance Use Disorder section with proper 42 CFR Part 2 citation and opt-in choices. Delivery options include mail, MyChart, fax, and encrypted email. However, the encrypted email option creates confusion: the checkbox says "Encrypted E-mail" but the accompanying consent language warns about "unencrypted e-mail" risks, leaving patients uncertain about what they're authorizing.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — not required by HIPAA — paired with a header warning that "FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION." Together, these could prevent a patient completing the form at home without a witness from submitting it.

Fee language references only South Carolina law ("fees may be charged as provided by S.C. Law") without acknowledging HIPAA's more restrictive cost-based fee limits for patient self-access requests. The MyChart instructions document goes further, stating a blanket fee "for all patient requests" with a prepayment requirement and no disclosed amounts — a notable compliance concern.

The form requires attaching a copy of photo identification, which is reasonable but adds friction for remote submission.

## Strengths

MUSC's standout features include: a **Spanish-language form** that faithfully mirrors the current English version with professional translation quality; **three clearly presented request pathways** including a fully digital portal option (Ciox/Swellbox); a **comprehensive nine-location facility directory** with fax numbers, phone numbers, and dedicated ROI email addresses; **granular SUD records consent** with correct 42 CFR Part 2 citation; and an **explicit citation of 45 CFR §164.524** (patient right of access).

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health demonstrates strong organizational infrastructure for records access — excellent findability, multiple pathways, bilingual support, and process-level differentiation between patient and third-party requests. However, the core downloadable form remains a generic authorization that doesn't center patient self-access, the PDF is not fillable despite a 2023 revision, and compliance details around fees and the witness requirement introduce unnecessary friction. The availability of the Ciox/Swellbox portal partially mitigates the form-level weaknesses by offering patients a fully digital alternative. Overall, this is a competent but not exceptional approach from a well-resourced teaching hospital.

# Millinocket Regional Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Millinocket Regional Hospital provides a single downloadable PDF form: an **"Authorization to Release Health Care Information"** document hosted on its website since at least 2014. This is the only records-related form found for the organization. There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The sole pathway for a patient requesting records is to download this two-page PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — most likely via fax to the number listed in the form header ((207) 723-3019).

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

The form does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. It is structured entirely around a third-party disclosure model: the patient authorizes "Name of Institution" to disclose records to another "Name of Institution or Person." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. The "reason for release" field offers only "continuing care" or "other (please specify)" — there is no option for "personal records request" or "individual access under HIPAA." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form repurposed for all release scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required persistence. Two generic web searches returned no results; only a site-scoped query (`site:mrhme.org`) succeeded. The form does not appear to be prominently linked from a patient resources or medical records page. The URL path (`/2014/06/`) suggests the document has not been updated in over a decade. Once located, the download was straightforward — no bot blocking or browser fallback needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat PDF with zero fillable fields**. All data entry uses underscore blanks designed for handwriting. The document has a text layer (not a scan) and uses four fonts, but it is fundamentally a print-and-fill artifact. The layout lacks section headers, visual hierarchy, or any design elements beyond bold title text. Record types are presented as an 18-item list (a–r) using an unusual **opt-out approach**: items are released unless crossed out, which uses double-negative logic that could easily confuse patients.

The form covers patient identification, sender/recipient institution, record type selection, reason for release, sensitive information consent (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric), and signature lines — approximately 25 fields across two pages. The language is mostly plain but includes alarming legalese: *"refusal or revocation of permission may result in improper diagnosis or treatment, denial of health benefits or insurance, or other adverse consequences"* — a warning that applies to third-party release scenarios but could discourage a patient exercising their right of access.

## Barriers & Red Flags

The form mandates: *"All spaces on this form MUST be completed for this release to be valid."* This blanket requirement goes beyond HIPAA's authorization elements and could be used to reject forms with trivially missing information. A **witness signature line** is included; combined with the all-fields-mandatory language, this effectively requires a witness — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, no response time is stated, and no delivery format options are offered.

## Bright Spots

The **18-category record-type checklist** provides meaningful granularity, including unusual categories like "Patient Additions" and "Responses to Patients Additions." The **sensitive information consent sections** correctly reference redisclosure restrictions for substance abuse records under 42 CFR Part 2. The form does include a brief patient rights statement acknowledging the right to review records and revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Millinocket Regional Hospital's records request process reflects a facility that has not modernized its patient access pathway. A single generic third-party release form — non-fillable, hard to find, and over a decade old — serves as the only documented mechanism. The form was not designed for patient self-access and contains unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, all-fields-mandatory mandate). While fax submission is available and the form provides good record-type granularity, the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# Duke University Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Duke Health provides four documents related to records release. The most relevant for a patient requesting their own records is **form-4.pdf** (M3132, Rev. 3/2025), the current enterprise-wide Authorization for Release of Information. This is a single-page, fillable PDF with 67 interactive fields, hosted on a well-organized medical records landing page. The companion **form-2.pdf** is a 3-page plain-language instruction sheet walking patients through each section of the authorization. Form-1 is an older revision of the same M3132 form (Rev. 4/2024) that remains accessible at a stale URL, and form-3 is an image-only scan of an even older revision posted on a satellite Duke outpatient clinic site — both are superseded and inferior to form-4.

Duke also mentions that Spanish-language versions are available on the official forms page, and the forms page links to additional documents (verbal release form, proxy access form, external records request).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Duke does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The M3132 authorization is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to serve both patient self-requests and third-party releases (attorneys, insurers, other providers). However, the form accommodates patient access reasonably well: Part B includes a "Self (Same Info As Above)" checkbox, Part D lists "Personal" as the first purpose option, and Part E prominently features "My Duke Health (Patients Only)" as a delivery method. The companion instructions explicitly address patients requesting their own records ("If you are the patient and are requesting the records be sent to you, select 'Self'"). While functional, a patient must still navigate sections designed for third-party scenarios, and the form doesn't distinguish the differing legal frameworks (Right of Access vs. Authorization) that apply to each case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy** — rated as a 2-click path from the Duke Health homepage (Medical Records → Authorization Forms). The official forms page is clearly titled, well-organized, and lists all available downloads. Web searches readily surface direct PDF URLs. The only retrieval concern is stale URLs: the older form-1 revision remains accessible via search engines, and a satellite Duke site hosts an image-only scan (form-3) that was uploaded as recently as June 2024 despite being from 2022.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the current primary form, is a strong digital-first artifact. It contains **67 fillable interactive fields** on a single page — enabling patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing. The layout follows a logical six-part structure (Patient Info → Recipient → Records to Release → Purpose → Delivery Format → Review/Approval) with clear section headers. The record-type selection offers excellent granularity: 14+ individual report categories, treatment date ranges, and facility-specific or enterprise-wide options. Sensible defaults are transparently stated ("Last 2 years of active treatment will be provided unless specified"). The language is generally clear and functional, though the legal disclosure text in Part F is dense. The companion instruction document (form-2) defines each medical record type in accessible language — an unusually thorough support resource.

## Barriers and Concerns

Duke imposes no notarization requirement; the witness section from the older revision has been removed entirely. Submission channels are robust: email, fax, and mail, with a phone number for questions. No in-person requirement exists. However, several issues merit attention:

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number — not required by HIPAA and an unnecessary privacy risk when medical record number and date of birth are also collected.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Duke Health may charge a fee" with "Charges may apply" noted for CD and paper delivery, but no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Patients must affirmatively check boxes for Mental/Behavioral Health and Genetic Testing to receive those portions of their own records — arguably a barrier for patient self-access, where HIPAA grants access to the complete designated record set. The form mentions HIV/AIDS in the text but provides no corresponding checkbox, creating ambiguity.
- **Unnamed form fields**: All 67 fillable fields lack descriptive names, creating an accessibility gap for screen reader users.

## Strengths

Duke excels in several areas: multiple electronic delivery options (MyChart patient portal, encrypted email, fax), granular record-type selection, companion instructions with plain-language medical definitions, multiple submission channels, and a clean digital-first form design. The existence of a separate instruction document with a helpline number demonstrates genuine investment in patient guidance. Electronic delivery options are listed first in Part E, signaling a preference for digital fulfillment.

## Overall Assessment

Duke University Hospital provides a well-organized, technically competent records request experience anchored by a strong fillable PDF form and excellent companion documentation. The primary limitation is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization designed for all release scenarios. The form handles patient self-requests adequately through its "Self" checkbox and "Personal" purpose option, but doesn't inform patients of their Right of Access or distinguish the simpler patient-access legal framework from third-party authorization. Minor concerns around SSN collection, vague fee disclosure, and sensitive-information opt-in prevent a top-tier rating, but overall this is an above-average experience.

# Massachusetts General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), part of the Mass General Brigham system (formerly Partners HealthCare), provides a single general-purpose authorization form for all records release requests. Three versions of this form were found at different URLs, representing the form's evolution from 2016 through 2024. The current version (form-1.pdf, MGB00087 06/24) is the clear best-available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Forms and Pathways

All three downloaded documents are versions of the same form — "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information." The current version is hosted on the parent system domain (massgeneralbrigham.org), while two older versions persist at legacy URLs on massgeneral.org. There is no dedicated patient access request form, online portal, or web-based request wizard. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it, and submitting via mail or fax.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MGH does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The same authorization form serves patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient selects "Personal" from the purpose checkboxes and checks a box to have records mailed to their own address. The form references HIPAA authorization requirements (§ 164.508) but never mentions the patient's Right of Access under § 164.524. This means a patient requesting their own records navigates a process designed primarily for third-party disclosure — workable, but not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, CAPTCHAs, or login requirements. The main concern is that two superseded versions remain publicly accessible at legacy URLs, creating a risk that patients could download an outdated, non-fillable version. The current form lives on the parent system domain rather than massgeneral.org, which could confuse patients who start at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a 2-page digitally native PDF with **78 fillable interactive fields** — a significant upgrade from the older versions, which had zero fillable fields. The form follows a clear A–E section structure: patient information, permission to share, information to be released, sensitive information consent, and terms/signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and logical flow.

Language is moderately plain — straightforward instructions at the top, clear section labels, and accessible phrasing in most areas. The required regulatory language in Section D (42 CFR Part 2 for substance use records) is necessarily dense but presented legibly. Section E's terms are written in clear, formal prose with important patient protections stated explicitly ("This authorization is voluntary"; treatment will not be conditioned on signing).

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: Patient Gateway (patient portal), secure email, fax, and paper mail — giving patients genuine electronic options for record receipt. However, submission of the form itself is limited to mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No electronic form submission**: Despite 78 fillable fields enabling digital completion, the form must be printed and mailed or faxed. Fax is an adequate electronic pathway per study criteria, so this is not a major penalty, but the gap between fillable fields and fax-only submission is a missed opportunity.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form notes "Copying fees may apply" for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes. Personal and Medical Care are not asterisked, implying no fees — but this is never stated affirmatively. HIPAA limits fees for patient access, and this distinction deserves explicit clarification.
- **Mandatory date specification**: Patients "MUST specify dates" for every record type requested, with no "all records" option. This could burden patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Stale versions at legacy URLs**: Two outdated, non-fillable versions remain publicly accessible, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Fillable PDF with comprehensive field coverage** (78 fields) — active investment in digital accessibility
- **Four electronic delivery options** including patient portal and secure email
- **Granular sensitive-information consent** with seven separate opt-in categories (HIV, genetics, substance use, mental health, social work, domestic violence, sexual assault)
- **Clear non-coercion statement** and voluntary authorization language
- **No notarization or witness required**
- **Version-controlled form** with clear identifiers (MGB00087 06/24)

## Overall Assessment

MGH provides a competent, well-structured authorization form with strong technical execution (fillable fields, electronic delivery options) but falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form. The form is easy to find, clearly organized, and free of major barriers. The primary gaps are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, ambiguous fee language, and the persistence of outdated form versions online. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process was designed for institutional release workflows rather than individual access rights.

# Garfield Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Garfield Medical Center (GMC), a for-profit community hospital in Monterey Park, CA, operated by AHMC Healthcare Inc., provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URL paths on the AHMC website. Neither form is specifically designed for patient self-access; both are general-purpose "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" documents that serve third-party release and personal use alike.

## Access Pathway

GMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient requesting their own records must use the same authorization form designed for release to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. The form includes "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox, and a patient could fill in their own name in the "Release To" field, but the framing is clearly oriented toward third-party disclosure ("I authorize Garfield Medical Center to Release Medical records to: Person/Organization"). There is no online portal, no digital request wizard, and no separate patient access request form.

That said, the form does include an "Inspect or Review Medical Record" option alongside copies, acknowledging the patient's right to review records in person — a positive touch that many facilities omit.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, login requirements, or browser workarounds needed. Both form versions were indexed and accessible via descriptive URLs. The only minor confusion is that two near-identical forms exist at different paths (`/gmc/documents/` and `/gmc/docs/`), both marked "Revised 9/21." A patient discovering both would have no clear way to determine which is authoritative.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — **not** a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand despite its digital origin. This is a significant missed opportunity: the form was clearly authored in a word processor but exported without interactive fields.

The layout is well-organized, following a logical flow: Patient Information → Release To → Purpose → Information to Be Released → Delivery Instructions → Notice of Rights → Term → Signature. Section headers are clear and distinct. The form offers impressive granularity in record type selection (12+ specific categories plus "ALL RECORDS") and provides multiple delivery options including email with a dedicated address field.

Language is generally accessible, using an "I understand that..." format for patient rights. However, legal references to California Health and Safety Code sections are included without plain-language explanation. The opening line — "Failure to provide all information may invalidate this authorization" — sets an intimidating tone, and it is unclear which fields are truly mandatory.

## Barriers & Concerns

- **CD liability waiver bundled into authorization:** All patients must waive liability for CD release as part of signing the form, even when not requesting imaging on CD. This is consent bundling.
- **Fees disclosed without amounts:** The form references California fee statutes but provides no specific costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate expenses.
- **Revocation limited to postal mail:** Revoking authorization requires a signed letter mailed to the Privacy Officer — no fax, email, or in-person option.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive absence.
- **Submission methods:** The form lists fax (626-307-2186), mail, email, pick-up, and hand delivery. Fax and email availability mean a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery option** with a dedicated field — uncommon among ROI forms.
- **"Inspect or Review" checkbox** alongside copies — acknowledges the HIPAA right to review.
- **Granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control.
- **Clear treatment non-conditionality statement** and 180-day expiration with patient override.

## Overall Assessment

Garfield Medical Center provides a reasonably well-structured authorization form that is easy to find and offers useful features like email delivery and record type granularity. However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form, lacking fillable fields, and bundling a CD liability waiver. The absence of a dedicated patient access pathway and the non-fillable PDF format are the most significant gaps. The facility meets the baseline for electronic submission (fax and email are available) but offers no modern digital workflow.

# GI Alliance — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

GI Alliance is a large, for-profit physician practice management organization headquartered in Southlake, TX, operating dozens of affiliated gastroenterology practices nationwide. Three forms were retrieved: one text-based authorization form from the main gialliance.com website (form-1), and two image-only scanned forms from affiliate practices Granite Peaks GI (form-2) and University GI (form-3). Form-1 is the canonical, centrally published document and represents the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Dedicated Patient Route

GI Alliance does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information," while forms 2 and 3 are explicitly titled "Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party." None reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or acknowledge the distinct legal framework for patient self-access versus third-party authorization (§ 164.508).

Form-1 does include a "at Patient's request" checkbox under the purpose section, making it technically usable for patient-directed requests, but the form structure — requiring a recipient address, lacking delivery format preferences, and using authorization language throughout — treats the patient as just another requester rather than an individual exercising a legal right. This conflation could cause the organization to inadvertently apply third-party authorization rules (higher fees, broader denial grounds) to patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the primary form was relatively straightforward. A site-specific web search surfaced form-1 directly at a WordPress uploads URL. GI Alliance maintains a patient forms page at `gialliance.com/patient-forms-and-prep/`, but it is organized by local brand/location, adding navigational complexity for patients who must first identify their affiliate practice. The affiliate forms (forms 2 and 3) required searching beyond the main domain. No login wall, bot blocking, or portal gating was encountered. Retrieval difficulty: easy for the main form, moderate for the affiliate variants.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available document, is a single-page text-based PDF authored digitally in Microsoft Word — a significant quality advantage over the affiliate scans. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are rendered as underscores, requiring the patient to print and handwrite. There is no electronic signature capability and no submit button. The form must be printed, completed by hand, and returned — but critically, **no submission method is specified anywhere on the form** (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link). A patient who downloads this form has no way to know where to send it without calling the organization.

The layout is logical, following standard authorization flow: patient identification → recipient → scope → sensitive categories → purpose → duration/revocation → signature. However, there are no bold section headers, no instructional text, and the language is moderately legalistic (e.g., "d/b/a GI Alliance on behalf of itself and all other practices that are operating as a single HIPAA Affiliated Covered Entity"). The form is concise at one page, which is a positive.

The affiliate forms (2 and 3) are substantially worse in quality: form-2 is a browser print-to-PDF with a completely garbled text layer (broken Type 3 font encoding), and form-3 is a raw scan with no text layer at all. Both are inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally. Form-3 appears to be truncated, missing required HIPAA authorization elements like the signature block and revocation instructions.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blank provider identity**: Form-1 leaves both the authorizing entity name and the revocation mailing address as blank fill-ins, creating a functional barrier for patients who don't know which affiliate practice to name.
- **No submission instructions**: None of the three forms specify where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees or the patient's right to cost-based pricing under HIPAA.
- **No processing timeline**: No indication of how long records fulfillment will take.
- **SSN collection**: Forms 2 and 3 request the last four digits of SSN — unnecessary for HIPAA record requests and a potential deterrent.
- **No delivery format options**: Form-1 does not ask how the patient wants to receive records; forms 2 and 3 offer only "E-Delivery" and "Mail."

## Bright Spots

- **Sensitive information categories**: Form-1 requires separate initials for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance use, and genetic information — a compliance-conscious design respecting state-level protections.
- **Explicit non-conditioning statement**: The clear declaration that treatment/payment won't be conditioned on signing is present and well-stated.
- **Concise format**: Form-1 covers all essential elements on a single page without being excessively dense.
- **Granular record selection** (affiliate forms): Forms 2 and 3 offer 9-10 specific record-type checkboxes, giving patients meaningful control over what information is released.

## Overall Assessment

GI Alliance provides a minimally adequate but patient-unfriendly records request experience. The organization channels all access requests — whether from patients, insurers, or attorneys — through a single generic authorization framework with no acknowledgment that patient self-access is a distinct right with its own legal protections. The primary form is digitally authored but not fillable, includes no submission instructions, and leaves critical fields (provider name, revocation address) blank. A patient attempting to request their own records online would download a form they cannot fill digitally, would not know where to send it, and would receive no guidance about fees, timelines, or their rights. The experience reflects organizational indifference to patient self-service rather than intentional obstruction.

# UCSF Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UCSF Medical Center offers a single ROI form — the "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (756-020Zi, Rev. 04/22) — available in both English and Spanish. Two English PDF URLs exist (form-1 and form-2 contain identical text; form-2 at `/pdf/roi-authorization.pdf` is the current canonical version linked from the Medical Records page). The Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 05/22) is also directly linked. The UCSF Health Medical Records page (`ucsfhealth.org/medical-records`) additionally mentions MyChart as an alternative pathway for accessing records and discloses fees ($0.25/page paper, $25 electronic).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

UCSF does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. The authorization form is a general-purpose release designed for any disclosure — from continuity of care to billing to third-party requests. A patient wanting their own records must fill in both the "I authorize [source]" and "to release health information to [recipient]" fields, effectively authorizing release *to themselves*. While "At the request of the patient/patient representative" is available as a purpose checkbox, the form makes no distinction between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party requesting records. There is no mention of HIPAA's individual access right, no response-time commitment, and no EHI export option. MyChart provides a separate digital pathway, but the PDF form is the primary documented process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. The first web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link. The UCSF Health website has a clean, well-organized Medical Records page that links to both language versions, describes the process, and discloses fees. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-only rendering was encountered. The only minor wrinkle is two English URLs serving essentially identical PDFs, which could confuse a patient who finds the older link via search.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-crafted, digitally-authored 2-page PDF** with 39 fillable interactive fields. It is not a scan — it has a clean text layer, uses 14 fonts, and includes no embedded images. An accessibility note ("Made accessible 12/18" on form-1; "Made accessible 7/23" on form-3) confirms deliberate remediation for assistive technology. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → source/destination → purpose → record types → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Parenthetical examples for each record type (e.g., "Entire Hospital Record (e.g. History and physical, consult, operative report, discharge summary…)") help patients understand their options. The sensitive-information section correctly requires separate opt-in for substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing records, with California statute citations.

However, there are quality issues: a typo ("specifcally") appears in both English versions, and the Spanish version has three spelling errors ("fnalidad," "específca," "tratatmiento") plus a missing radiology request section that exists in the English versions — a meaningful content gap for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no excessive barriers**: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person submission mandate. Fees are disclosed on the website (not the form) at $0.25/page or $25 electronic — within HIPAA limits. The "Your Rights" section clearly states the authorization is voluntary, explains revocation rights, and notes the right to a copy.

The primary submission gap is that **general (non-radiology) requests must be mailed** to physical addresses in San Francisco or Oakland. Only radiology requests have fax and email submission options. The form itself provides no electronic submission path for general authorizations, creating a workflow disconnect: a patient can fill the form digitally but must then print and mail it.

## Overall Assessment

UCSF Medical Center earns credit for form findability, document quality, Spanish-language availability, and clean sensitive-information handling. The main weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients navigate a generic third-party release form), the mail-only submission requirement for general requests, and quality control gaps in the Spanish translation. The org demonstrates institutional attention to accessibility and transparency, but has not yet designed its records request process around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, a nonprofit community hospital in Downers Grove, IL, operates under the Advocate Health system and uses system-wide forms for medical records requests. The organization distinguishes itself by maintaining a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-4, "Patient Request for Health Information") that is clearly separated from its third-party authorization form (form-5, "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information"). This separation is a best practice that most healthcare organizations do not follow.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Seven documents were retrieved, but only four are relevant to patient medical records access:

- **Form-4** (primary): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a single-page form designed specifically for patients requesting their own records, with a "Myself" checkbox, portal callout, and five delivery method options.
- **Form-5**: "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — the third-party disclosure authorization, a companion to form-4.
- **Form-6**: Spanish-language authorization form (corresponds to the third-party release, not the patient self-request form).
- **Form-7**: Step-by-step instructions for completing the authorization form, with a portal-first framing.

The remaining forms (form-1, form-2, form-3) are Employee Assistance Program releases or a legacy Advocate Medical Group form — none relevant to hospital patient access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocate Health earns high marks for pathway differentiation. Form-4 is explicitly titled "Patient Request for Health Information" and opens with a prominent callout: *"Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org."* The form's first recipient option is "☐ Myself." This is a clear, dedicated patient access pathway — patients are not forced through a generic third-party authorization workflow.

The organization also offers the LiveWell patient portal as an alternative digital pathway, referenced on both form-4 and the instructions document (form-7). This portal-first suggestion is a notable patient-centered design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Advocate Health medical records page (advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records) clearly lists both primary forms with direct PDF download links, plus the Spanish version and instructions. No bot blocking was encountered, and all PDFs downloaded successfully. The main challenge was that the system-level organization of forms means patients searching specifically for "Good Samaritan Hospital" forms may not immediately find the centralized system page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the patient self-access form, is a well-designed single-page document that fits patient demographics, 22+ record-type checkboxes (across medical records, imaging, and billing categories), delivery method options, sensitive information acknowledgment, and signature blocks into one page. The layout is logical with clear three-column organization for record types. Language is plain and accessible.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a born-digital PDF with 8 embedded fonts and clean vector graphics. Patients must print and hand-fill, a significant missed opportunity. The form also **lacks submission instructions** — there is no mailing address, fax number, or email address telling patients where to send the completed form.

Five delivery methods are offered: paper copy by mail, CD, encrypted email, patient portal, and in-person pick-up. The inclusion of encrypted email is uncommon and welcome.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form is relatively barrier-free: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person-only submission mandate. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("Fees may apply") without amounts or a fee schedule reference. No response time is stated. Form-4 does not include an explicit patient rights statement, though form-5's companion rights section covers revocation, non-conditioning, and re-disclosure.

A notable gap exists for Spanish-speaking patients: the Spanish-language form (form-6) corresponds to the third-party authorization, not the patient self-request form. Spanish-speaking patients must use a more complex disclosure authorization to request their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, via its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its dedicated patient access form and portal-first messaging. The differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release is a model for other organizations. The form's content design is solid — concise, well-organized, and comprehensive in scope options. The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a paper workflow for the form itself), missing submission instructions, and vague fee language. The patient portal provides a digital alternative that partially compensates for the PDF's limitations. Overall, this organization provides an above-average patient experience for records access, earning a **B** grade.

# Lexington Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Lexington Medical Center (West Columbia, SC) publishes three documents on its Medical Records page at lexhealth.com/medical-records: an English-language "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (form-1), a full Spanish translation of the same form (form-2), and a supplemental Reproductive Health Attestation form (form-3) implementing the 2024 HIPAA privacy rule. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a two-page general-purpose ROI authorization. The website also mentions MyChart as a digital option for records requests, though that portal-based pathway was not directly evaluated.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lexington Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic authorization: "I authorize the following provider/entity _____ to release my health information to: Recipient/Provider Name: _____." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly designate themselves as both the authorizer and the recipient — an unintuitive workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no separate patient access form, and no language explaining that patients have a legal right to obtain their own records. The form funnels all requests — whether to insurers, attorneys, family members, or the patient themselves — through the same third-party release authorization framework.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which links directly to all three PDFs. No bot blocking, no JavaScript rendering issues, and no portal login was required. The Medical Records page provides context for both digital (MyChart) and paper-based requests. This is a well-organized web presence for records access information.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a digitally-authored, text-based PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores and all checkboxes are non-interactive symbol characters. Patients must print and complete the form by hand. The layout is well-organized into three clear sections: patient identification and routing, medical records release details with a granular record-type checklist (~25 categories), and review/authorization terms with a signature block. At two pages, the length is appropriate. Language is moderately formal — not impenetrable legalese, but not plain language either. The authorization conditions (Section 3) use standard legal register that most adults could follow with careful reading.

Submission is limited on the form itself: the only method stated is postal mail ("Mail completed form to: Lexington Health Attn: Medical Records, 2720 Sunset Blvd."). However, Condition 6 states that "a copy or fax of this document is just as valid as the original document," implying fax submission would be accepted, though no fax number is provided for the records department. The website separately references MyChart for digital requests.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness signature** is required — a welcome absence. The form also explicitly accepts copies and faxes as valid. However, there are notable concerns:

- **Full SSN collection**: The form requests the patient's complete Social Security Number as a top-level identifier, which is unnecessary for HIPAA purposes and creates identity theft risk on a document designed to be mailed.
- **Blanket substance abuse/psychiatric disclosure**: Condition 1 states that alcohol abuse, psychiatric, drug abuse, and communicable disease records "will be released" with no opt-out, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records.
- **Undisclosed fees**: Patients are told "there may be a charge" and must call (803) 791-2264 to learn the amount — no upfront fee transparency.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires in 90 days, which is short but generally adequate for a single records request.

## Notable Strengths

The **Spanish-language version** (form-2) is a full professional translation co-located with the English form — not buried in a separate section. It uniquely includes an interpreter services phone number with conference call instructions, a thoughtful accessibility touch. The **granular record-type checklist** gives patients meaningful control over what gets released. The **Reproductive Health Attestation** (form-3) demonstrates proactive compliance with recent HIPAA regulatory changes, ahead of many peer organizations.

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Medical Center makes its forms easy to find and offers a well-organized, bilingual paper-based workflow. However, the process fundamentally treats patient self-access as indistinguishable from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a generic authorization form not designed for their needs. The non-fillable PDF and mail-only submission (on the form itself) create unnecessary friction in an era of digital health records. The SSN collection and blanket substance abuse disclosure represent compliance concerns. The organization earns credit for findability, bilingual access, and clear layout, but falls short on patient-centeredness and technical accessibility.

# Phelps Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, NY is a community hospital within the Northwell Health system. It uses Northwell's system-wide forms for medical records requests, hosted at the parent system's medical records page (northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records). Six documents were retrieved in total: two core forms (patient access and third-party authorization), a Spanish bilingual authorization form, two companion instruction guides, and a duplicate non-fillable version of the authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

Northwell Health stands out by clearly differentiating patient self-access from third-party release. The medical records page has two distinct sections: "Request for Access to Health Information" (for patients requesting their own records) and "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (for directing records to third parties). The patient access form (form-2) is explicitly titled "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative" and opens by citing HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524) — framing the request as an exercise of patient rights rather than a permission grant. A "To me" checkbox in Section 2 makes the self-access pathway concrete. This separation is a genuine best practice that many health systems fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches for "Phelps Hospital" combined with medical records terms immediately surfaced the Northwell Health medical records page. The page is well-organized with descriptive URLs and clear section headings. The main friction is that Phelps Hospital's own sub-site (phelps.northwell.edu) does not host forms directly — patients must navigate to the parent system's website, which is a minor extra step but the connection is clear from the Northwell branding.

## Form Document Quality

The primary patient access form (form-2) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with 28 fillable interactive fields. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence: patient demographics, facility releasing records, recipient (with "To me" option), delivery manner and format, requested health information scope, substance use/HIV section, and signature. The delivery options grid is particularly well-designed, pairing delivery manner (mail, pickup, email, fax) with format (paper, USB, CD, secure/unsecure email) in a structured table. Scope options include medical record abstract, date-range records, entire record, lab results, radiology, itemized bills, and a free-text "Other" field — giving patients granular control.

The language is reasonably plain, with parenthetical glosses like "(From Who)" and "(To Who)" alongside formal labels. The substance use disorder section (Section 5) is denser legal text, but it's conditionally required — only for patients requesting those specific record types. A companion instruction document (form-6) provides step-by-step annotated examples with sample data, significantly lowering the completion barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization is required. The witness signature line is present but not explicitly mandatory. No fees are mentioned. No in-person submission is required. These are all positives.

The most significant gap is the absence of submission instructions on the form itself — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link. A patient who fills out the form has no guidance on where to send it. Fax submission is presumably available as an industry standard for Northwell facilities, but the patient must find this information independently.

A notable equity concern: the website has a bug where both the "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)" links point to the same URL, which contains only the Spanish authorization (third-party) form. There is no Spanish-language version of the patient access form despite the website appearing to offer one. This effectively denies Spanish-speaking patients access to the correct form for exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

## Notable Strengths

The strongest features of Northwell's approach for Phelps Hospital patients are: (1) the dedicated patient access form with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation, (2) companion instruction documents for both forms with annotated visual examples, (3) rich delivery format options including secure email, USB, CD, and fax, (4) fully fillable interactive PDFs for digital completion, and (5) plain-language accessibility touches throughout. The dual-form architecture — with separate patient access and third-party release pathways — represents a structural investment in patient-centered design.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Hospital, through its parent Northwell Health system, provides an above-average patient records request experience. The dedicated patient access pathway — with its explicit HIPAA § 164.524 framing, separate form architecture, and companion instruction materials — represents a genuinely patient-centered design that earns top marks for patient-centeredness. The fillable digital forms and comprehensive delivery options round out a strong offering. The main weaknesses — missing submission instructions on the form and the broken Spanish form links — are addressable defects rather than structural problems. This is a solid B-grade experience overall (4.25/5.0): clearly competent and patient-aware, with room for improvement in closing operational gaps.

# Cuba Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cuba Memorial Hospital is a small, independent critical access hospital in Cuba, NY, affiliated with the Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) alongside Olean General Hospital (OGH) and Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC). The hospital does not publish its own medical records request form. Instead, patients must discover and use ROI forms from affiliated UAHS facilities, found on a separate organization's website.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two forms were retrieved, both from the BRMC-OGH website (brmc-ogh.org), not from Cuba Memorial's own site:

- **Form 1 (OGH)**: "Authorization for Patient Access and/or Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," branded for Olean General Hospital. This is the most relevant form since both OGH and Cuba Memorial are New York facilities within UAHS.
- **Form 2 (BRMC)**: Nearly identical form branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Less relevant due to cross-state jurisdiction, but its blank disclosing-organization field makes it theoretically more adaptable.

The hospital's website also mentions a "YourHEALTH" patient portal for electronic record access, but no ROI form or formal request process is linked from the portal page.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are dual-purpose: their title explicitly covers both "Patient Access" and "Use and Disclosure." Section 4 includes dedicated checkboxes for patient inspection or copies, alongside a third-party release authorization line. This is a modest positive — the form acknowledges patient self-access as a use case rather than treating it as an afterthought. However, the form is fundamentally a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all release purposes, not a dedicated patient access form. A Cuba Memorial patient must also contend with the fact that neither form mentions their hospital by name, creating real confusion about which form to use and where to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was moderately difficult. Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website has no medical records page, no patient forms section, and no downloadable ROI form. Multiple search strategies — including site-specific searches, direct navigation, and sitemap review — yielded nothing. The forms were only discovered by following a small footer link from Cuba Memorial's site to the BRMC-OGH website, then navigating to the medical records page. A patient would need to recognize this footer link as relevant, navigate a different organization's site, and infer that the "OGH" form applies to their Cuba Memorial records — a non-obvious multi-step process.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are 2-page, digitally produced PDFs with text layers — not scans. However, neither has fillable fields (fillable_field_count: 0). Patients must print and complete them by hand. The forms use a numbered seven-section structure (authorization statement, disclosing organization, record types, recipient/patient access, patient rights, expiration, specially protected information) that provides reasonable organization. Approximately 15 fields require completion for a patient self-access request.

The language is moderately legalistic but generally comprehensible. Patient rights statements in Section 5 cover voluntariness, no treatment impact, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, and right to copies. However, a typo in Section 5(c) — "but in do" instead of "but if I do" — has persisted across both forms since at least 2017, suggesting the templates are unmaintained.

## Barriers

- **No clear submission pathway**: The forms provide no instructions for how to submit them. The bolded statement "Photo ID is required for records to be picked up" implies in-person pickup as the expected or only delivery method. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or online submission option is mentioned on the form or the BRMC-OGH medical records page.
- **Witness lines**: Dedicated witness signature lines appear without indication of whether witnessing is required or optional, potentially deterring patients from submitting unwitnessed forms.
- **90-day expiration**: Authorization expires after 90 days, which is unnecessary for patient access requests under HIPAA's ongoing right of access.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) mentions "a reasonable copy fee" with no specifics or fee schedule reference.
- **Outdated forms**: Both forms were last revised in January 2017, predating Information Blocking rules and 21st Century Cures Act implementation.

## Strengths

- The form explicitly contemplates patient self-access with dedicated inspection/copies checkboxes — relatively uncommon among generic authorization forms.
- Granular record type selection (11 categories with date ranges) gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.
- Appropriate handling of specially protected information (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) with separate consent checkboxes consistent with New York law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Overall Assessment

Cuba Memorial Hospital presents significant access challenges for patients seeking their own records online. The hospital publishes no form of its own, requiring patients to navigate to an affiliated organization's website and use a form branded for a different hospital. The forms themselves, while structurally adequate and notably inclusive of patient self-access checkboxes, are non-fillable, outdated, and provide no guidance on submission or delivery methods. The implied requirement for in-person pickup with photo ID — potentially at a facility 30+ miles away — represents a meaningful barrier for a rural critical access hospital population. The overall experience falls short of patient-centered design, earning a grade of C.

# The Iowa Clinic — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

The Iowa Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in West Des Moines, Iowa. Notably, the organization has fully transitioned away from downloadable PDF authorization forms: all medical records requests are now handled through third-party online platforms. The two PDF forms evaluated (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf) were retrieved exclusively from the Wayback Machine and date from approximately 2012–2015. They are no longer available on the live website.

## Available Pathways and Current State

The Iowa Clinic's medical records page (https://www.iowaclinic.com/for-patients/payment-billing/medical-records/) routes patients through four distinct channels depending on who is requesting records:

1. **Patient self-requests**: Datavant/Swellbox Health Record Wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/iowa-clinic-wizard.html) — an online portal for patients to request their own records.
2. **Imaging records**: A Formstack-powered web form on the Iowa Clinic website.
3. **Healthcare providers**: A separate Swellbox wizard.
4. **Third-party organizations**: SmartRequest portal (https://smartrequest.com).

This multi-channel architecture is the most relevant finding: The Iowa Clinic **does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release** at the website level, routing patients to a dedicated Swellbox wizard while directing third-party organizations to a separate SmartRequest portal. This structural separation is a meaningful strength.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page itself was straightforward — it's accessible under For Patients > Payment & Billing > Medical Records. However, finding downloadable PDF forms required significant effort since none exist on the current site. The PDFs were only recoverable through Wayback Machine archive searches of defunct URLs (`/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf` and `/static/docs/medical-records-release-form.pdf`). No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Historical Form Quality (form-1.pdf — Primary Evaluated Form)

Form-1.pdf is the newer of the two historical forms — a single-page "Authorization for Release of Information" with a clean digital layout (not a scan), text layer present, but **zero fillable fields**. It would require printing and handwriting. The form has approximately 15 fields including patient demographics, record-type checkboxes (8 options), destination address, purpose of release (6 options plus "Other"), sensitive-information opt-out initials, and signature. The layout follows a logical flow and fits everything on one page without excessive cramming.

The language is a mix of plain and semi-legal. Disclosure paragraphs are readable but contain some dense constructions. The form includes a "Request by patient" purpose option, which is a bright spot — acknowledging patient-initiated access even within a form designed primarily for third-party release. Submission was by fax (515-875-9600) or mail only.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection**: Both forms request Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The electronic transmission clause shifts all liability for misdirected fax/email to the patient, which is an overreach.
- **Fees**: The forms mention a "cost-based fee" without specifying amounts — compliant language but leaves patients unable to anticipate costs.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax and mail were offered as submission methods on the historical forms; the current online portal eliminates even these steps.

## Notable Strengths

The Iowa Clinic's most significant strength is its forward-looking transition to a fully digital, portal-based workflow. By routing patient requests through Swellbox/Datavant — a purpose-built health records request platform — the organization has eliminated the print-fill-fax cycle entirely for patients with internet access. The website's clear separation of patient requests from third-party requests demonstrates awareness of the distinction between individual access rights and authorization-based release.

## Overall Assessment

The Iowa Clinic presents a bifurcated picture. Its **current state** is strong: the organization has modernized beyond PDF forms to online portals with clear pathway differentiation. However, the **historical forms** we could directly evaluate were generic ROI authorization forms with no fillable fields, SSN collection, and liability waivers. Scoring reflects the best available current pathway (the Swellbox portal) while noting that the only downloadable form documents available for detailed quality assessment are from 2012–2015 and no longer represent the patient experience. For a patient requesting their own records today, The Iowa Clinic offers a patient-centered, digitally accessible process.

# Black River Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Black River Memorial Hospital (Black River Falls, WI) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital operating under the "Black River Health" brand. The organization offers a single downloadable ROI form for patients requesting health records. There is no patient portal–based request pathway, no online submission wizard, and no dedicated patient access form — only a general-purpose "Release of Information Authorization" that serves all release scenarios.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one ROI-related form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page "Release of Information Authorization" linked from the Patient Resources page. The form covers both directions of information flow — releasing records from the organization and receiving records to it — and is designed primarily for facility-to-facility transfers. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this general-purpose form, selecting "Per Patient Request" as one of eight possible reasons for the release.

No online portal, email submission, or electronic request pathway exists. The form lists delivery format options for *receiving* records (Mailed, Faxed, Pick Up, CD) but provides **no instructions for how to submit the completed form** — no mailing address, fax number, or drop-off location. The only contact information on the form is the HIPAA Privacy & Security Officer phone number (715-284-5361). A patient would need to call to determine how to return the form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. It is linked from the Patient Resources page under a "Forms" section, labeled "Authorization to Disclose Information." A site-specific web search also surfaced the direct PDF URL immediately. The description on the website frames the form as being for sharing information "from other healthcare facilities or providers" — not explicitly for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Black River Memorial Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form funnels all requests through the same authorization workflow. While the form includes "Per Patient Request" as a reason option and page 2 contains a substantive patient rights section (right to receive a copy, refuse to sign, revoke, inspect, and prohibition of conditions), the form's structure assumes a third-party release scenario: Section 2 asks "who has the information" and Section 3 asks "where you want it sent." A patient requesting their own records must work within this framework, which isn't designed for them.

## Form Document Quality

The form has **severe technical accessibility problems**. Despite being created in Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 in 2025, the PDF renders virtually all text as images — 970 embedded images across 2 pages, with only 43 characters of extractable text. The form has zero fillable/interactive fields; patients must print and complete it by hand. This makes the form inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.

On the positive side, the visual layout is well-organized with numbered sections and clear headers using question-like phrasing ("Why the information is needed," "How would you like this information"). The form is a reasonable 2 pages in length. However, Section 2 confusingly mixes source facility checkboxes with information-type checkboxes (Alcohol Treatment, HIV Results), and Section 5 imposes a default 2-year scope if the patient doesn't specify a date range.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. The form mentions a "reasonable fee may be associated" for inspecting or copying records but provides no specifics on amounts or HIPAA fee limitations. No response time commitment is stated. The prohibition of conditions language is explicitly included — the organization cannot condition treatment or benefits on signing the authorization. A photocopy clause ("as valid as the original") is a patient-friendly touch.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Easy findability, explicit prohibition of conditions, photocopy validity clause, patient-friendly expiration (remains in effect until processed), and direct HIPAA Privacy Officer contact information.

**Red flags:** The near-total text inaccessibility of a modern Word-generated PDF is a significant barrier, particularly for patients with disabilities. The complete absence of submission instructions means a patient who downloads the form online has no idea how to return it. The lack of any dedicated patient access pathway means every patient must navigate a form designed for third-party releases.

## Overall Assessment

Black River Memorial Hospital provides an easy-to-find form with reasonable content and good compliance language, but the technical execution is poor and the patient access experience is an afterthought. The image-rendered PDF and missing submission instructions create unnecessary friction for a patient trying to exercise their right of access. **Grade: C.**

# Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center: Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system, offers patients three distinct pathways to request medical records: **MyChart** (patient portal), **eRequest** (an online wizard powered by Swellbox/Datavant at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html), and a **downloadable paper form**. Fax (513-599-4503), email (MercyROI@datavant.com), and phone (844-835-1238) are also listed as contact channels for Springfield.

Four PDF documents were retrieved, but only two are relevant to Springfield patients. **Form-1** is from mercy.net (a separate Missouri-based Mercy system)—a false positive caused by the confusingly similar branding. **Form-2** is a Youngstown-region variant from the correct system but wrong region. **Form-3** is the system-wide authorization form currently linked on the website, but it is an **image-only scan** with only 46 characters of extractable text—functionally inaccessible to screen readers or digital filling. **Form-4** (MHP 0785 Rev 1/19) is the Springfield-specific authorization form with full text layer, but it is **not linked anywhere on the website**—it was discovered only by guessing the URL pattern (`mercy.com/-/media/.../springfield.ashx`).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. All PDF forms are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information"—generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release. Form-4 accommodates patient self-access via a "Self" checkbox and defaults the purpose to "For Personal use if not otherwise stated," which is patient-friendly. However, the form structure, title, and legal framing are oriented toward third-party authorization. A dedicated patient access request form (like the one from the Missouri mercy.net system, ironically) does not exist within Bon Secours Mercy Health's offerings for Springfield.

The eRequest portal via Swellbox/Datavant represents a potentially more patient-centric pathway, as it is an online records request wizard that may differentiate between request types. However, only the PDF forms were directly evaluated.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page was straightforward—`mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests` is well-organized with clear pathways. However, finding the **right PDF form** for Springfield was surprisingly difficult. The linked system-wide form (form-3) is an image-only scan—a 2024 regression from the 2019 text-based regional versions. The Springfield-specific text version exists at a predictable URL but is entirely undiscoverable through normal website navigation. Additionally, web searches conflated mercy.com (Ohio) with mercy.net (Missouri), producing a false-positive form from the wrong health system.

## Form Document Quality (Form-4, the Best Available PDF)

Form-4 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a full text layer—but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it requires printing and hand-filling. The layout is logical: patient demographics → facility selection → date range → record types (11 checkboxes) → recipient → format → delivery → legal disclosures → signature. The top half is clear and well-organized; the bottom half compresses six dense legal bullet points into small paragraphs with complex language ("Treatment, Operations or Payment disclosures to insurance companies when the law gives the right to the insurers to contest a claim under policy"). The form cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and offers four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email) with electronic format (PDF/CD) as the default—an uncommon patient-friendly choice.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable concerns emerge. First, **"Photo ID required at the time of request"** is stated in the header with no guidance on how this applies to fax or mail submissions, creating ambiguity that could deter remote requests. Second, **"Entire record (standard two years of information, unless otherwise specified)"** imposes a default time limitation that patients may not notice, potentially resulting in incomplete records when HIPAA's Right of Access covers the entire designated record set. Fee language is vague: "There may be a charge for copies of records" with no amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee distinction. No notarization is required, and multiple electronic submission methods are available (fax, email).

## Notable Strengths

The organization offers a genuinely multi-channel approach: MyChart, Swellbox/Datavant eRequest portal, and paper form with fax/email/mail submission. The electronic format default, personal-use default purpose, explicit § 164.524 reference, and MyChart delivery option are all bright spots. The form is available in English only—no multilingual versions were found for Springfield.

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center provides an **adequate but fragmented** patient records request experience. The eRequest portal and MyChart offer digital pathways, but the downloadable form—the fallback option—suffers from critical problems: the linked version is an image-only scan, the better text version is hidden, no forms have fillable fields, and the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access instrument. The result is a C-grade experience where digitally-savvy patients who find the portal do fine, but patients seeking a traditional form encounter unnecessary friction.

# Valley Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valley Medical Group (VMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice with offices in Amherst, Easthampton, Greenfield, and Northampton, Massachusetts. For medical records requests, VMG fully delegates to **MediCopy**, a third-party Health Information Management vendor. The practice does not publish its own ROI form — instead, its website (vmgma.com) features a prominent "REQUEST RECORDS" link that redirects patients to MediCopy's patient portal at medicopy.net.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Two PDF authorization forms were found, both hosted on MediCopy's website:

- **form-1.pdf** — MediCopy's generic English-language authorization for release of medical records
- **form-2.pdf** — Spanish-language version of the same MediCopy form

MediCopy also offers an online HelloSign-based authorization (https://app.hellosign.com/s/01LCH5zj), providing a fully digital alternative to the PDF. The English PDF (form-1.pdf) is the most relevant document for assessing the patient experience, as it is the standard-language version of the form VMG patients are directed to use.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

VMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic MediCopy release-of-information authorizations designed for sending records to a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own information twice — once as the patient and again as the recipient — and select "Personal Use" from the purpose options. While "Personal Use" is listed, the form's structure (with separate "patient" and "recipient" sections) is clearly oriented toward disclosure to others. There is no dedicated patient access form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no streamlined self-request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form requires **moderate effort**. The "REQUEST RECORDS" link on vmgma.com is visible in the header and footer, which is helpful. However, clicking it sends the patient to medicopy.net — a third-party domain that may feel unfamiliar or untrustworthy. From there, the patient must navigate to MediCopy's ROI landing page to find the downloadable PDF, a 3-click cross-domain journey. A web search for "Valley Medical Group medical records request" would not surface the MediCopy form, since it contains no VMG branding whatsoever. The "Facility Name" field is blank — patients must know what to write.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (7 fonts, proper text extraction), it functions as a print-and-fill document. The layout is clean and uses conversational section headers phrased as questions ("Tell us about the patient," "What would you like released?"), which is more approachable than typical legal-heavy forms. Record type selection offers 11 checkboxes plus exclusion options for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postage.

However, the form has **no submission instructions** — no address, fax number, or email for returning the completed authorization. A patient who downloads this PDF in isolation would have no idea where to send it. The file is also disproportionately large (1.39 MB for one page).

## Barriers and Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required** — positive
- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for a records release and creates a privacy risk
- **Fee disclosure**: The English form mentions an "additional fee" for postage but provides no fee schedule; the Spanish form references 45 CFR 164.524 and mentions a "reasonable fee" but discloses no amounts
- **No response time commitment** stated
- **Default release of sensitive records**: The opt-out framing means substance abuse, HIV, and psychiatric records are released unless the patient affirmatively checks exclusion boxes

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — meaningful for a small independent practice
- **Online HelloSign alternative** exists alongside the PDF, providing a digital submission pathway
- **Email delivery option** for receiving records
- **Sensitive-information exclusion checkboxes** give patients granular control
- **Conversational, plain-language headers** make the form approachable

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No VMG branding or customization** — completely generic MediCopy form
- **No fillable fields** on the PDF despite digital creation
- **No submission instructions** on the form itself
- **SSN collection** is unnecessary and risky
- **No patient rights statement** regarding Right of Access or fee limitations
- **Poor Spanish translation** with mistranslations ("lanzado" for "released") and grammatical errors

## Overall Assessment

Valley Medical Group provides a functional but generic pathway for records requests through its MediCopy partnership. The "REQUEST RECORDS" link on the homepage is a reasonable starting point, and the availability of both a PDF form and an online HelloSign option gives patients choices. However, the complete lack of VMG customization, the absence of fillable PDF fields, missing submission instructions, and the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release all indicate a process that was outsourced without much thought given to the patient experience. The form serves its administrative purpose but does not center the patient.

# Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital is a critical access hospital in Miller, SD, part of the Avera Health regional nonprofit system. The facility does not publish its own ROI form; instead, patients use Avera Health's system-wide "Authorization – Release Of Medical Records Information" form (Form 8691-04). Only one form was found applicable to this facility.

## Pathway Assessment: Generic Third-Party Authorization

The sole available form is a **general-purpose HIPAA authorization** designed for disclosure of records between any two parties. It does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third party (attorney, insurer, other provider) requesting records with patient authorization. The form's structure — with separate "Provider (Who is releasing information?)" and "Disclose Information to (Where is information to be sent?)" sections — frames the transaction as a release between entities, not as a patient exercising individual access rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524).

There is no dedicated patient access form, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no simplified workflow for self-access. A patient wanting their own records must complete the same authorization form as a third-party requester, filling in themselves as the recipient. The form does reference 45 CFR 164.524 in its authorization block, acknowledging the right to inspect or obtain copies, but this is buried in legal boilerplate rather than presented as a primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The Hand County facility profile page on avera.org does not link directly to any medical records form. A patient would need to navigate to Avera Health's system-level "Request Medical Records" page or perform a web search. Additionally, Avera's website **blocks automated downloads** (curl/wget return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. The form URL is descriptively named, which is a minor positive.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally generated PDF** with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, making it a print-and-handwrite document. Patients must print, fill by hand, and submit via fax or mail. The layout uses labeled left-margin sections (Patient Identification, Provider, Disclose Information to, etc.) which provide reasonable navigation, but fitting all content onto one page results in a visually dense, cramped document. The language mixes moderately plain English with regulatory references (42 CFR Part 2, 45 CFR 164.524) and HIV/AIDS disclosure warnings — functional but not optimized for patient readability.

The form asks for approximately 15–18 discrete fields including patient demographics, provider information, recipient information, record type checkboxes, date ranges, format preferences, purpose, expiration date, and signature. This is a moderate field count for an authorization form, though several fields (provider address, recipient fax) add complexity that a patient self-access form would not need.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and may deter privacy-conscious patients.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" field is present without clarification of whether it is required or optional. If interpreted as mandatory, this creates an unnecessary barrier.
- **No submission instructions on form**: The form does not print a mailing address or designate the fax number as a submission destination; the Avera fax number (605-322-8200) appears only in the context of "questions about disclosure."
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Charges may apply" for entire record requests with no fee schedule or amounts provided.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: The form offers paper, fax, flash drive, CD-ROM, and email — with encryption by default and an explicit opt-out for unencrypted delivery. This is a notably comprehensive set of format choices.
- **45 CFR 164.524 citation**: Explicit reference to the HIPAA Right of Access provision signals regulatory awareness.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Covering all required elements on one page reduces printing burden.

## Overall Assessment

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital provides a functional but **generic, third-party-oriented** pathway for records access. The form is adequate for its purpose as a system-wide authorization but does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, SSN collection, and ambiguous witness requirement create friction. The strong delivery format options and 45 CFR 164.524 reference are bright spots, but the overall experience reflects an organization that has not optimized for patient-initiated access requests.

# NorthLakes Community Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NorthLakes Community Clinic is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Ashland, Wisconsin. The organization publishes two Release of Information forms on its website, both generic HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 authorization forms that serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party transfers, legal, disability, and more. There is no dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization.

## Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms are publicly available from the medical records page (https://nlccwi.org/for-our-patients/medical-records/):

- **form-1.pdf** ("Release of Information," 12/2023): The newer, current form. One page, numbered sections (1–6), with clear "Release FROM" / "Release TO" fields, granular record-type checkboxes, and explicit fax submission instructions (715-318-5644). However, it has **zero fillable fields** — a patient must print and hand-fill it. It does offer an encrypted email delivery option for receiving records.

- **form-2.pdf** ("Health Information Release," 4/2022): The older form with **54 fillable PDF fields**, intentionally designed for digital completion (the filename includes "Fillable"). But it lacks any submission instructions — no fax number, no mailing address, no email. A patient who fills it out digitally has no idea where to send it.

Both share the same internal registration number (REG-002), suggesting form-1 was meant to supersede form-2, yet both remain available with no guidance on which to use. The organization appears to have regressed in digital accessibility: the newer form removed fillable fields while adding better submission instructions and an encrypted email delivery option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NorthLakes does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Release FROM" / "Release TO" structure designed for inter-organizational transfers. A patient requesting their own records must place NorthLakes in the "FROM" field and themselves in the "TO" field — workable but not intuitive. Positively, both forms include a "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox, explicitly acknowledging patient-directed requests as a valid use case. Neither form references HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) by name.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A simple web search immediately returned both PDF URLs. The organization's website hosts them as direct links under a clearly labeled medical records section. No bot blocking, login, or JavaScript rendering was required. Retrieval difficulty: **Easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Assessed using the high-watermark principle across both forms:

- **Fillability**: The older form-2 is genuinely fillable with 54 interactive fields. The current form-1 is not. A patient aware of both could use form-2 for digital completion, but the org steers toward form-1.
- **Layout**: Both forms use numbered sections with reasonable logical flow (patient info → directionality → purpose → record types → consent/signature). However, both cram everything onto a single dense page. Form-2's purpose and record-type sections are visually interleaved in a confusing two-column layout.
- **Language**: Consent paragraphs lean toward dense legalese, particularly on form-2 where a long unbroken paragraph covers treatment conditioning, re-disclosure, 42 CFR Part 2, Wisconsin DHS regulations, and revocation rights with no visual breaks. Form-1 improves on this with bulleted "I understand that..." statements.
- **Record selection**: Unusually granular. Both forms separate Mental Health, Substance Use Treatment, and Psychiatry records into distinct categories with individual checkboxes — giving patients fine-grained control over sensitive disclosures.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness required. No in-person submission requirement. Fax submission is explicitly available (form-1). No fees are mentioned — neither disclosed as free nor quantified. No response time is stated, though form-1 provides an urgent fax line for requests "requiring a response within a week." The confusing citation of "Federal Privacy Law (42 CFR Part 2) (HIPAA)" incorrectly implies 42 CFR Part 2 is part of HIPAA, which could mislead patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Encrypted email delivery option for records (form-1)
- "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox on both forms
- Granular behavioral health record type selection
- Verbal revocation explicitly acknowledged (form-2)
- Clear treatment non-conditioning language
- Fillable PDF exists (form-2), showing digital investment capability

## Overall Assessment

NorthLakes Community Clinic provides a functional but unrefined patient access experience. The forms are easy to find, free of major barriers, and offer good record-type granularity. However, the organization funnels all patients through a generic ROI authorization designed for third-party transfers, with no dedicated patient access pathway. The regression from a fillable to a non-fillable primary form is a notable step backward. A patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience. **Grade: C (3.35/5.0).**
