# Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, a ScionHealth-affiliated for-profit community hospital in Hartsville, SC, offers two publicly available ROI forms: an English "Release of Information Authorization / Requisition Form" (form-1.pdf) and an identical Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are hosted on ScionHealth's CMS infrastructure and linked directly from the hospital's medical records page at cprmc.com/medical-records. No additional patient access forms, online portals, or digital request wizards were found. The hospital uses MRO Corp as its third-party ROI vendor for processing requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms structured around a "disclosing provider → recipient" model. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the "Name of Recipient" section with their own information — a workflow designed for third-party disclosure, not individual access. The form references 45 CFR 160 and 164 only in the context of redisclosure risk and never mentions HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524). There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no simplified self-request form, and no portal-based alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-specific web search immediately surfaced both PDF URLs, and the medical records page provides direct links alongside submission instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, or multi-click navigation was encountered. File names are descriptive (`Authorization_Update_(English).pdf`). This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — but with **zero fillable fields**. Every field must be completed by printing and handwriting. The layout is organized into two sections: Section A for patient and recipient demographics plus record type selection, and Section B for seven legal statements with a signature block. The 15-category record type checklist (face sheet, H&P, labs, imaging, etc.) with an "All Records" option provides good granularity. However, the single-page format forces dense layout with limited whitespace, and the legal statements use moderately complex language referencing CFR provisions. The form lacks instructions beyond section labels, provides no guidance on how patients will receive their records, and includes a "purpose/reason for this request" field without noting that HIPAA does not require patients to justify self-access requests.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable red flags emerge. First, Statement 6 states that patients "may need to have my physician authorize" the use or disclosure of sensitive information in their records — language that could function as an illegitimate barrier to patient access under HIPAA's Right of Access. Second, the "For Office Use Only" section includes a Social Security number field, creating unnecessary data exposure risk. The form discloses no fees, states no response timeline, and does not mention the MRO Corp third-party vendor relationship. On the positive side, no notarization is required, and submission channels include fax and email in addition to in-person delivery — adequate electronic submission options.

## Notable Strengths

The availability of a professionally translated Spanish-language form is a genuine bright spot, particularly for a community hospital. Both language versions are equally accessible from the medical records page. The granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control over their request scope. The easy online findability — direct links, descriptive URLs, no access barriers — represents a model for form availability.

## Overall Assessment

Carolina Pines provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and submit, and the Spanish translation is commendable. However, the lack of any patient self-access differentiation, zero fillable fields, concerning physician-gating language for sensitive records, and absence of fee or timeline transparency place this organization squarely in the middle tier. A patient can navigate this process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Mayers Memorial Hospital District — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were found for Mayers Memorial Hospital District, a government-owned critical access hospital in Fall River Mills, California:

1. **form-2.pdf** — A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" branded with the hospital's name, adapted from the California Hospital Association template (CHA 16-1, March 2013). This is hosted directly on the hospital website but critically mislabeled as "Disclosure of Privacy Practices" in the site navigation. It is the hospital's primary ROI authorization form (form number MMH 470).

2. **form-1.pdf** — A 1-page generic, unbranded "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It was found only through web search and is not linked from any page on the hospital website.

For a patient requesting their own records, **form-2.pdf is the most relevant** — it is the branded hospital form, includes a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose, and contains a substantive "My Rights" section. However, both forms are fundamentally structured as third-party release authorizations.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mayers Memorial does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms require patients to fill in a recipient's name and address, meaning a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own contact information as the "recipient." Form-2 partially acknowledges patient self-access through a "Patient request" checkbox, but the workflow remains identical to a third-party release. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding a usable form was **difficult**. The hospital's Medical Records page provides only department hours and a phone number — no downloadable form, no request instructions. The branded form (form-2) is linked from the Patients & Visitors page under the misleading label "Disclosure of Privacy Practices," a title that describes an entirely different type of document. A patient looking for a records release form would likely skip this link. The generic form-1 is only discoverable through external web search leading to a third-party CDN URL.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-2** (the primary form) is an **image-only scan** with no text layer and no fillable fields. It cannot be searched, copied from, or read by screen readers — a significant accessibility failure. Despite the poor digital format, its content is reasonably well-structured: clear section headers, checkboxes for record scope (all records vs. specific types), granular sensitive-information checkboxes (mental health, HIV, substance abuse) each requiring initials, and a "My Rights" section written in plain first-person language. Estimated field count is approximately 15 fields across 2 pages.

**Form-1** has a text layer (digitally created) but also lacks fillable fields and is far less complete — no checkboxes, no scope options, no rights statement, and no HIPAA-required authorization elements (expiration, revocation).

Neither form provides any submission instructions — no fax number, mailing address, email, or portal link. A patient who completes the form has no documented path to submit it without calling the hospital.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions on either form**: The most critical barrier — patients cannot determine how to return a completed form.
- **Image-only scan** (form-2): Completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.
- **Intimidating opening language** (form-2): "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — potentially chilling for patients who lack details like their MRN.
- **Mislabeled web link**: The form is hidden behind an incorrect label, making it effectively unfindable through normal navigation.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form addresses whether fees will be charged.

## Bright Spots

- The "My Rights" section on form-2 is genuinely well-written in plain first-person language, clearly stating patients' rights to refuse, inspect records, and revoke authorization.
- Sensitive information handling is properly separated with individual checkboxes and initial lines, compliant with California law and 42 CFR Part 2.
- Use of the CHA template ensures baseline legal compliance with California health privacy requirements.

## Overall Assessment

Mayers Memorial provides a below-average patient experience for records access. While the branded form has decent content design rooted in its CHA template, the combination of extremely poor findability, an image-only scan format, absent submission instructions, and no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release creates a frustrating and largely inaccessible process. A patient attempting to request their own records online would struggle at every step — finding the form, reading it with assistive technology, understanding how to complete it for self-access, and figuring out where to submit it.

# West Tennessee Healthcare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

West Tennessee Healthcare (Jackson, TN) is a government-owned regional health system that demonstrates an above-average approach to patient record access by maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** (form-3) separate from its third-party release authorization (form-2) and an older clinic-level release form (form-1). The organization also offers an online request portal via ScanSTAT and publishes Spanish-language versions of its key forms. However, the forms themselves are not fillable PDFs, and some legacy legal language undermines the patient-centered intent.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all linked from a clearly labeled medical records page at wth.org/request-medical-records/:

- **Form-3 (primary)**: "Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — explicitly subtitled "To be used when patient wants to access their own medical record or allow a personal representative to do so." This is the most relevant form for patient self-access. It offers five delivery methods: paper, fax, CD/DVD, portal, and email (encrypted or unencrypted). Two pages, ~3,300 characters.
- **Form-2**: "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" — a third-party release authorization. One page, similar structure but without the portal delivery option.
- **Form-1**: "Medical Release Authorization" — an older (2019) form specific to the West Tennessee Medical Group Clinics. Functions as a general release for discussing care with designated individuals.

Additionally, the medical records page links to a **ScanSTAT online request portal** for hospital records, providing a fully digital alternative pathway. Spanish versions of forms 2 and 3 are also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

West Tennessee Healthcare clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release — a practice that relatively few organizations follow. Form-3 uses "request" language (appropriate for HIPAA § 164.524) rather than "authorization" language, and includes a portal delivery shortcut ("If choosing portal, please proceed to signature line. No other action needed"). The medical records webpage provides context to help patients choose the correct form. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The layout is logical — flowing from identification to delivery method to record selection to legal terms to signature — but relies on underscored blank lines and an initials-based record type selection system (15 categories). The language is moderately accessible in the patient-facing sections but becomes denser in the five legal "I understand" statements. No section headers divide the form; the structure relies on spatial layout and field labels. At two pages, the length is proportionate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search returned direct PDF links, and the medical records page is clearly labeled and well-organized. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The page provides good context about when to use each form.

## Barriers and Concerns

Two compliance issues stand out on form-3:

1. **Liability waiver**: "The facility is hereby released from any liability and the undersigned will hold the facility harmless for complying with this request." Requiring patients to waive liability to exercise their Right of Access is problematic under HIPAA.
2. **90-day expiration on an access request**: This language was carried over from the authorization form and is conceptually inappropriate — a patient access request is a one-time action, not an ongoing authorization that needs to expire.

Additional minor concerns include the driver's license requirement for non-in-person requests, SSN collection (last 4 digits), no fee disclosure, and no explicit statement of patient rights or response timeframe. The form also omits the non-conditioning statement that appears on form-2.

## Bright Spots

- **Dedicated patient access form** with clear purpose statement
- **ScanSTAT online portal** as an alternative digital pathway
- **Spanish-language versions** of both key forms
- **Multiple delivery options** including portal and encrypted email with risk disclosure
- **Easy findability** from a well-organized medical records page

## Overall Assessment

West Tennessee Healthcare shows genuine patient-centered intent by distinguishing patient access from third-party release and offering multiple pathways including an online portal. The organization loses points for non-fillable PDFs, legacy legal language (liability waiver, expiration clause), and missing rights/fee information. The structural approach is strong, but the execution — particularly the form document quality and some compliance details — keeps this from being a top-tier example. Overall, a solid B-level performance that could reach A-level with fillable fields and cleaned-up legal language.

# AdventHealth Central Texas — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Central Texas is a nonprofit community hospital in Killeen, TX, part of the major AdventHealth system. Two ROI forms were found: a system-wide authorization form (form-1, ADV-800003A, rev. 2022) and a facility-specific "Request For Access And Authorization" form (form-2, AHCT 616, rev. 2005). Both were easily discoverable via web search, downloaded directly from the AdventHealth CDN with no barriers.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The facility-specific form (form-2) is the more relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. It explicitly includes a checkbox for "Provide me with access to the protected health information specified below" as its first option — a clear patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party disclosure. The system-wide form (form-1), by contrast, is architecturally a third-party disclosure form that funnels all requests through a "Disclose To" entity-naming structure. While it lists "Personal Use" as a purpose, a patient would need to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient.

The existence of both forms creates a "which form?" problem. Neither form references the other, and no landing page was found that explains when to use which. A patient could reasonably download the system-wide form first and never discover the more patient-friendly facility-specific version. That said, the facility-specific form does meaningfully differentiate patient access from third-party release — it presents four distinct action options (access, copies, disclosure to others, summary) rather than treating everything as a third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search for "AdventHealth Central Texas authorization release health information medical records form PDF" surfaced both PDFs immediately. No bot blocking, login walls, or navigation mazes were encountered. The forms are hosted on AdventHealth's CDN at direct URLs. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — full marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are digitally created PDFs with extractable text — neither is a scan. However, **neither form has any fillable/interactive fields** (both have zero fillable fields per metadata). Every field must be completed by hand after printing. This is a significant gap, especially for the system-wide form revised as recently as 2022. The "Affix Patient Label Here" boxes on form-2 further signal a paper-first, in-facility design never adapted for remote digital use.

Form-2 (the primary patient access form) is 2 pages with approximately 20–25 fields. The first page is reasonably organized: action checkboxes, patient demographics, record type selection (12 categories plus catch-alls), and a disclosure recipient section. The second page is a dense block of legal "I understand..." statements followed by signature blocks. The legal language is moderately formal but comprehensible. However, the lack of bullet points or visual separation in the legal text makes it harder to parse.

The system-wide form (form-1) is more complex, with 12 numbered sections spanning 48+ checkbox options across medical/surgical and behavioral health record types. It is visually overwhelming for a routine records request.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-2 requires a witness signature for all requests — not just behavioral health records. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access, making this an unnecessary barrier for patients completing the form at home.

**Fees**: Form-2 mentions a "reasonable, cost-based fee" but provides no specific amounts or fee schedule. The summary option pre-fills a blank for cost, setting an expectation of charges without transparency.

**90-day authorization cap**: Form-2 limits authorization to a maximum of 90 days, which is restrictive and conflates patient access requests (which don't require authorization under HIPAA) with third-party disclosure authorization.

**Wrong state law**: Form-1 references the "Illinois Mental Health and Development Disabilities Confidentiality Act" despite being served at a Texas facility — a clear legal citation error from a system-wide template not adapted for local jurisdiction.

**No notarization required**: Neither form requires notarization. Submission can be done by fax (254-526-7134) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit patient access pathway**: Form-2's first checkbox is "Provide me with access to the protected health information" — a rarity that centers patient self-access.
- **Broad catch-all category**: Form-2 includes "Any other personally identifiable information used by AdventHealth Central Texas to make medical decisions about me" — an unusually expansive request option.
- **Local contact information**: Form-2 provides facility-specific phone and fax numbers, unlike the generic system form.
- **Secure email delivery option**: Form-1 offers secure email as a delivery method, more progressive than fax-only alternatives.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: Both forms correctly state that refusing to sign will not affect treatment or benefits.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Central Texas offers a mixed experience. On the positive side, the facility-specific form includes genuine patient access language and the forms are trivially easy to find online. On the negative side, neither form is fillable, the facility form is over 20 years old, a witness signature creates unnecessary friction, and the two-form landscape creates confusion about which to use. The organization earns credit for having a patient access pathway at all — many peers offer only generic third-party authorization forms — but the execution falls short of modern standards for digital accessibility and form hygiene.

# Riverwood Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Riverwood Healthcare Center is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Aitkin, MN. It maintains a Patient Forms page with multiple release-of-information documents and offers both printable PDF and online JotForm submission options. Three PDF forms were found (from 2015, 2018, and 2025), all general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms for releasing patient information. The organization also uses MyChart (OCHIN) for patient portal access, though this is not positioned as a records request channel on the Patient Forms page.

## Available Forms and Pathways

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3.pdf** (2025), the current "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" linked from the Patient Forms page as the "Printable Form." Two older versions (2018 and 2015) remain publicly accessible at their original WordPress upload URLs but are no longer linked from the main forms page. All three forms share essentially the same structure: patient demographics, release from/to fields, purpose checkboxes, record type selections, sensitive information opt-out, and standard HIPAA authorization language.

Critically, Riverwood also offers **HIPAA-compliant JotForm online submission** (https://hipaa.jotform.com/222405586410046) as an alternative to the printable PDF. This provides a fully digital workflow — no printing, handwriting, or faxing required. A second JotForm for "Consent for Release of Information" and a third for "Permission to Verbally Discuss PHI" are also available. These online options represent a meaningful accessibility advantage over the PDF-only approach.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Riverwood does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three PDF forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for releasing information from one entity to another. A patient requesting their own records must use the same from/to structure intended for third-party transfers — listing themselves in the "Release Information To" field. The "Personal Use" purpose checkbox is available, signaling that self-requests are anticipated, but there is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no statement of patient rights.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A simple web search for Riverwood's ROI form surfaced direct PDF links immediately. The Patient Forms page is accessible in one click from the main site navigation and provides organized links to both printable and online form options. The only concern is that outdated form versions (2015, 2018) remain publicly accessible, meaning a patient arriving via search engine could encounter a superseded form.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a **single-page, digitally composed PDF** with a clean layout, clear section headers, and notably helpful parenthetical plain-language guidance (e.g., "RELEASE INFORMATION FROM (WHO HAS THE INFORMATION YOU WANT RELEASED?)"). This design choice makes the form substantially more approachable than typical legal-style ROI forms.

However, the PDF has **zero fillable fields** — all checkboxes are Unicode characters (☐) rendered as text, not interactive elements. A patient must print and hand-fill the form. The JotForm alternative addresses this gap for patients who find it. The form does not collect Social Security Numbers (an improvement over the 2015 version, which did), and does not require a witness signature (also improved from the 2015 version).

Field count is reasonable at approximately 15–18 fields including demographics, from/to addresses, purpose, date range, record type selections, and signature. The authorization language is standard but dense, packed into two paragraphs with no visual breaks between concepts.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** on the current form — a positive.
- **Fax submission available** (218-927-5319), providing an electronic submission pathway beyond the JotForm.
- **No fees disclosed** on any form — appropriate for the authorization itself, though patients are not informed about potential costs.
- **Sensitive information defaults to release:** The form states "All information regarding chemical dependency will be released unless you restrict by initialing." This opt-out approach for 42 CFR Part 2–protected substance abuse records is the most significant compliance concern.
- **"Guardian" misspelled as "Gaurdian"** on the current form — a minor but unprofessional error.
- **Ambiguous revocation language:** The form requires patients to "present" written revocation to the Medical Records Department, which could be read as requiring in-person delivery.

## Overall Assessment

Riverwood Healthcare Center provides a **competent but undifferentiated** records request experience. The organization earns credit for easy findability, offering both printable and online submission options (via JotForm), and producing a clean single-page form with helpful plain-language guidance. The JotForm option is a genuine bright spot that elevates the digital experience. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the generic authorization form design, the non-fillable PDF, and the concerning opt-out model for sensitive information prevent a higher rating. This is a typical small critical access hospital approach — functional but not patient-centered.

# Bayshore Medical Center — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Bayshore Medical Center, part of the Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) system, routes patients through the system-wide infrastructure for medical records requests. Six documents were retrieved during the search process, but only two are directly relevant for a Bayshore patient requesting their own records: the **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary English pathway) and the **CMR-003 authorization form** (form-6, a 2-page PDF covering all 11 HMH hospitals). A Spanish companion form (CMR-003S, form-3) mirrors the English PDF. Additional documents include an older Medical Group outpatient release form (form-1, dated 2018), two forms from sister facility Pascack Valley (forms 2 and 5), and a records amendment form (form-4).

The primary pathway for English-speaking patients is the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, linked from the HMH system-wide Medical Records page under "Request Records." Spanish-speaking patients are directed to the CMR-003S PDF download. Notably, the English PDF version of CMR-003 is **not linked** from the Medical Records page — it was found only through web search under an inconsistent URL path (medical-group/patient-forms rather than patients-visitors).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Bayshore does not offer a dedicated patient self-access PDF form. The CMR-003 PDF is a generic HIPAA authorization framed around third-party disclosure: "I authorize Hackensack Meridian Health to release information to: Organization/Recipient." A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name as the "recipient" and select "Personal use" from five purpose options — an awkward workaround. The online portal (Swellbox/Datavant) likely provides a more patient-centric experience as the primary pathway, but the PDF form does not distinguish between individual access and third-party release.

Interestingly, Pascack Valley Medical Center (an HMH sister facility) offers a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-5) with patient-first language and a "Myself" default recipient option. This demonstrates that the HMH system has the concept of a dedicated patient-access form but has not standardized it across all facilities.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the relevant forms required significant effort. The search involved web searches, site-specific navigation, URL pattern guessing, and cross-facility comparison. The Bayshore Medical Center sub-page links to the HMH Medical Records page (2–3 clicks), which prominently features the Swellbox portal but buries the PDF forms. The English CMR-003 was located via web search under the Medical Group directory — a misleading location for a hospital-level form. Retrieval difficulty: **hard**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary PDF form (CMR-003, form-6) is a born-digital 2-page document with a clean text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print and hand-write all entries. This is particularly notable given that HMH's own amendment form (form-4) has 54 fillable fields — proving the organization has the capability but did not apply it to the ROI form. The layout is logically structured with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient info → recipient → location → records → purpose → sensitive-record consent → signature → delivery format. Record type granularity is good (11 categories) and delivery format options are comprehensive (paper, encrypted USB/CD, fax, secured email).

Language is a mix of plain and legal. Core instructions are clear, but the minor consent section and legal disclosures use dense, nested phrasing. The form lacks explicit submission instructions — while the contact directory on page 2 lists HIM phone and fax numbers for each campus, the form never tells patients *how* to submit the completed authorization. The fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee… Please ask."

## Barriers and Bright Spots

No notarization, in-person submission, or witness requirements exist. Fax submission is available (Bayshore HIM fax: 732-888-7332), providing an adequate electronic pathway. The vague fee disclosure and absent submission instructions are minor barriers.

The standout bright spot is the **EHI Export option** — an explicit offer to provide records in a machine-readable format uploadable to another EHR. This is exceptionally rare on ROI forms and directly supports 21st Century Cures Act interoperability goals (despite the typo "Electric" instead of "Electronic" Health Record). The Spanish companion form, comprehensive contact directory, and granular sensitive-record consent are additional strengths.

## Overall Assessment

Bayshore Medical Center, via HMH, provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox/Datavant portal offers a digital-first primary pathway, and the PDF form — while non-fillable and oriented toward third-party release — includes progressive features like EHI Export and multilingual availability. The main weaknesses are the difficult findability of the English PDF, the generic authorization framing that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, and the lack of fillable fields on a form that could easily support them. Grade: **B**.

# Baptist Health Lexington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Baptist Health Lexington is a community hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, part of the Baptist Health (Kentucky) system. It does not maintain facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it relies on system-wide forms published by the parent system at baptisthealth.com. Three documents were retrieved, all system-level.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found:

1. **Form 1 (Primary):** "Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — the current system-wide authorization form, revised February 2026. A 3-page, dual-purpose document covering both patient self-access ("Myself" checkbox) and third-party release ("Other person/organization" checkbox). Includes delivery method options (paper, fax, email, CD, MyChart), record type packages, sensitive information consent, and a helpful "Tips" page. Submission is via fax or mail to a centralized Release of Information office in Louisville.

2. **Form 2:** "Request for Medical Records" — a simpler, 1-page patient-access-specific form hosted on the MyChart portal (mychart.baptist-health.org). Explicitly framed for patients requesting their own records. Dated July 2019, making it nearly seven years old. Notably, it contains no submission instructions — no address, fax number, or email.

3. **Form 3:** An older, undated version of the same system-wide authorization (Form 1). Two pages, still publicly accessible alongside the 2026 version at a non-versioned URL, creating potential patient confusion.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Baptist Health demonstrates partial differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (Form 1) is a generic HIPAA authorization, but it clearly labels a "Myself" option on its first page and notes that purpose of release is "not required if being disclosed directly to patient." A dedicated patient access form (Form 2) does exist but is outdated and lacks submission instructions, making it less useful in practice. The primary pathway a patient would encounter — through the medical records page at baptisthealth.com — is the generic authorization form with a patient self-access checkbox.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Basic web searches and the organization's medical records page led directly to downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The only friction is that a patient searching specifically for "Baptist Health Lexington" must recognize that the parent system's form applies. The coexistence of old and new form versions at similar URLs is a minor navigational hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (Form 1) is digitally authored with a text layer and clean typography, but has **zero fillable fields**. All entry areas are blank lines and non-interactive checkbox graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is well-organized with clear section headers (Patient Info, Release To / Delivery Method, Purpose, Information to Release) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. The record type "Package" system (Key Documentation vs. All Documentation) with detailed descriptions is genuinely helpful. The third page ("Tips for Requesting Medical Record Copies") provides useful practical guidance including a 15-calendar-day turnaround goal, MyChart default delivery, and contact information.

Language is mostly plain on page 1 but dense with required legal text on page 2 — HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder (42 CFR Part 2), revocation rights, and re-disclosure warnings. The sensitive information consent is bundled as an all-or-nothing authorization with no opt-out for individual categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Not fillable:** Despite being digitally created, no forms offer interactive fields — a significant missed opportunity.
- **SSN collection:** The last 4 digits of SSN are requested without being marked optional, exceeding what HIPAA requires for patient identification.
- **Sensitive information bundling:** The authorization bundles consent for mental health, HIV/AIDS, and substance use disorder records with no ability to exclude specific categories.
- **Outdated form still live:** Form 3 (undated older version) remains publicly accessible and could lead patients to use a superseded form with a potentially incorrect mailing address.
- **No fees mentioned:** While appropriate for patient access under HIPAA, the absence of any fee information leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart as default delivery:** If no delivery method is specified, records default to the patient's Baptist Health MyChart account — a patient-friendly, electronic-first approach.
- **Package-based record selection:** The tiered Package 1/Package 2 system with clear descriptions simplifies an inherently complex choice.
- **Toll-free phone support:** Contact information includes both local and toll-free numbers, plus a dedicated MyChart support line.
- **15-day turnaround goal:** Proactively commits to a faster-than-required timeline (HIPAA allows 30 days).
- **Multiple delivery options:** Paper, fax, email, CD, and MyChart cover a wide range of patient preferences.

## Overall Assessment

Baptist Health Lexington, through its parent system, provides a competent but conventional records request process. The primary form is well-organized and clearly accommodates patient self-access, but the reliance on a non-fillable PDF and fax/mail submission keeps this firmly in the traditional paper-workflow category. The existence of a dedicated patient access form (Form 2) shows awareness of the distinction, but its outdated status and missing submission instructions undercut its value. The bright spots — MyChart default delivery, helpful tips page, and clear package descriptions — demonstrate patient-centered thinking within the constraints of a legacy form design.

# WellSpan York Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

WellSpan York Hospital is part of WellSpan Health, a regional nonprofit health system in Pennsylvania. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms at the system level on wellspan.org. **Form-1.pdf** ("Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information," Form #2606, Rev. 08/25) is the primary system-wide form applicable to York Hospital and all other WellSpan facilities. **Form-2.pdf** ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information") is scoped exclusively to three WellSpan neighborhood hospitals (Newberry, Shrewsbury, Carlisle) and does not apply to York Hospital. The assessment below focuses on form-1.pdf as the relevant patient pathway.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WellSpan does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form or pathway distinct from third-party release. Form-1.pdf is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization with a bidirectional "Obtain from" / "Disclose to" structure designed for third-party transfers. However, the form does include a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an unusually clear statement of the right to self-access: *"I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."* This language partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated pathway, but a patient must still navigate a form framed around releasing records to another party and figure out how to adapt it for self-access (e.g., writing their own name in the "Disclose to" field).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A straightforward web search immediately returned a direct PDF link on wellspan.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. Multiple search strategies all converged on the same document. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1.pdf is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a complete text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally created, all fields are blank underscored lines, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient identification flows into record source/destination, then record type selection, purpose, delivery format, sensitive-records disclosure, legal terms, signatures, and submission instructions. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records paragraph on page 1 is a dense run-on sentence that could benefit from formatting improvements.

Record type options are well structured with five top-level categories (Abstract with detailed sub-list, Diagnostic Test Results, Imaging, Billing, and Complete record). Delivery format options are a standout feature: patients can choose Paper, CD, Fax, or Email, where the email option delivers records through a secure portal as PDFs available for 30 days.

## Barriers & Compliance

The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's SSN — an unnecessary data collection practice that introduces privacy risk without being required for patient identification. A witness signature line on page 2 creates ambiguity about whether a witness is routinely required or only for specific circumstances. Fees are mentioned as "regulated by state and federal law" but no specific amounts are disclosed. Notably, form processing is handled by MRO Corporation, a third-party ROI vendor, meaning patients interact with MRO rather than WellSpan directly.

On the positive side: the form explicitly accepts copies in lieu of originals, does not require notarization, and clearly states that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing. The 12-month authorization window is reasonable.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit the completed form via **fax** (717-812-8119), **email** (PatientRequests@wellspan.org), or **mail** to the York, PA HIM office. The availability of fax and email means patients are not required to physically visit the facility or rely solely on postal mail.

## Overall Assessment

WellSpan York Hospital provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed authorization form with modern delivery options (secure portal) and explicit right-to-self language. However, the absence of fillable fields in a born-digital PDF, the generic third-party authorization structure, the SSN collection, and witness ambiguity prevent it from reaching the top tier. The organization serves patients adequately but has clear room for improvement in both digital accessibility and patient-centered design.

# Arizona Community Physicians — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Arizona Community Physicians (ACP) is an independent, for-profit physician practice group in Tucson, Arizona. The organization maintains a well-organized patient forms page at azacp.com/forms/ with seven downloadable PDFs covering general records release, practice-specific release, imaging-specific release, adult/minor access designation, a Spanish minor access form, and a HIPAA amendment request. Critically, ACP also offers an online electronic records self-request wizard through Swellbox (swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html), providing a modern digital pathway alongside the paper forms.

## Relevant Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1.pdf** — the general "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (Form 100, revised 08/26/2024). However, ACP also provides the **Swellbox online wizard**, which is the superior pathway for a patient who wants to submit a request electronically without printing, hand-filling, and physically delivering a paper form. The forms page links to both options, giving patients a choice.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

ACP does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release, with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields that frame the transaction as a provider-to-provider or provider-to-entity transfer. The "TO" field is labeled "Name of Physician/Organization," implying the recipient should be another provider rather than the patient. A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name and address in that field, but the form provides no guidance for this use case. The purpose checkboxes include "At request of Patient," which at least acknowledges patient-initiated requests, but the form structure does not differentiate the legal framework (HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524 vs. authorization under § 164.508).

The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, may offer a more patient-centric experience as an electronic self-request tool, though its exact workflow was not evaluated as a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding ACP's forms was **easy**. The Patient Forms page is linked from the main website navigation, and multiple search strategies (web search, site-specific search, direct navigation) all returned direct PDF URLs. No login, bot blocking, or browser fallback was needed. The forms page is clearly organized and lists all seven documents. The Swellbox wizard link is also present on the forms page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF** with a native text layer. Despite being revised in August 2024, it has zero fillable fields — all blanks are underscore placeholders requiring printing and handwriting. The layout is clean and logically organized with capitalized section headers (PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM/TO, PURPOSE, TYPE OF INFORMATION). The language is generally plain and accessible, though the fee disclosure is confusingly placed as a footnote under the "Other" purpose checkbox rather than in its own section. The form collects a reasonable set of fields (~12-15 blanks) without requesting a Social Security Number — a positive privacy practice. It includes a "Former Name" field, which is a thoughtful inclusion.

The form offers three delivery format options (paper, disc/PDF, email), though email is restricted to "medical records processed by CIOX" without explaining what that means. The two-tier record type structure appropriately separates general records from protected records (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse) with distinct consent checkboxes.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness requirements.** Fees are disclosed at $0.07/page and $6.50/disc — both modest and within HIPAA limits — though "additional charges for shipping and handling" are mentioned without quantification. The one-year authorization expiration is standard. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated.

The most significant barrier is the **absence of submission instructions** on form-1 itself — no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal URL. A patient who downloads and prints the form has no idea where to send it. This is a functional defect. By contrast, form-7 (amendment request) includes explicit mail, fax, and in-person delivery instructions. The Swellbox wizard partially mitigates this by offering an entirely separate electronic pathway, but form-1 doesn't reference it.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox electronic self-request wizard** provides a modern digital alternative to the paper form ecosystem
- **Comprehensive form suite** — seven distinct documents covering diverse patient needs, including imaging-specific and amendment request forms
- **Spanish-language minor access form** (form-6) demonstrates language access awareness appropriate for Tucson's ~42% Hispanic population
- **No SSN collection** on the primary ROI form
- **Protected records separation** with distinct checkboxes for HIV, behavioral health, and substance abuse
- **HIPAA amendment request form** published online — uncommon among practices

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient self-access form** — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization
- **No fillable fields on any form** — all seven PDFs are flat, print-and-fill documents
- **No Spanish version of the primary ROI form** (form-1), despite Spanish availability for the minor access form
- **Missing submission instructions** on the primary ROI form
- **Fee disclosure placement** is confusing (buried under "Other" purpose checkbox)
- **1-year default records limitation** may surprise patients seeking complete history

## Overall Assessment

ACP demonstrates above-average organizational effort in making patient forms accessible online, with a well-organized forms page, a comprehensive suite of documents, and — crucially — a Swellbox electronic self-request option that elevates the patient experience beyond the paper-form baseline. However, the primary ROI form itself is a generic third-party authorization that doesn't distinguish patient self-access, lacks fillable fields, and omits submission instructions. The availability of the Swellbox pathway is the key differentiator that lifts ACP's overall assessment, though the paper form ecosystem could benefit from modernization and better patient-access-specific design.

# NorthLakes Community Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NorthLakes Community Clinic is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Ashland, Wisconsin. The organization publishes two Release of Information forms on its website, both generic HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 authorization forms that serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party transfers, legal, disability, and more. There is no dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization.

## Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms are publicly available from the medical records page (https://nlccwi.org/for-our-patients/medical-records/):

- **form-1.pdf** ("Release of Information," 12/2023): The newer, current form. One page, numbered sections (1–6), with clear "Release FROM" / "Release TO" fields, granular record-type checkboxes, and explicit fax submission instructions (715-318-5644). However, it has **zero fillable fields** — a patient must print and hand-fill it. It does offer an encrypted email delivery option for receiving records.

- **form-2.pdf** ("Health Information Release," 4/2022): The older form with **54 fillable PDF fields**, intentionally designed for digital completion (the filename includes "Fillable"). But it lacks any submission instructions — no fax number, no mailing address, no email. A patient who fills it out digitally has no idea where to send it.

Both share the same internal registration number (REG-002), suggesting form-1 was meant to supersede form-2, yet both remain available with no guidance on which to use. The organization appears to have regressed in digital accessibility: the newer form removed fillable fields while adding better submission instructions and an encrypted email delivery option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NorthLakes does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Release FROM" / "Release TO" structure designed for inter-organizational transfers. A patient requesting their own records must place NorthLakes in the "FROM" field and themselves in the "TO" field — workable but not intuitive. Positively, both forms include a "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox, explicitly acknowledging patient-directed requests as a valid use case. Neither form references HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) by name.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A simple web search immediately returned both PDF URLs. The organization's website hosts them as direct links under a clearly labeled medical records section. No bot blocking, login, or JavaScript rendering was required. Retrieval difficulty: **Easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Assessed using the high-watermark principle across both forms:

- **Fillability**: The older form-2 is genuinely fillable with 54 interactive fields. The current form-1 is not. A patient aware of both could use form-2 for digital completion, but the org steers toward form-1.
- **Layout**: Both forms use numbered sections with reasonable logical flow (patient info → directionality → purpose → record types → consent/signature). However, both cram everything onto a single dense page. Form-2's purpose and record-type sections are visually interleaved in a confusing two-column layout.
- **Language**: Consent paragraphs lean toward dense legalese, particularly on form-2 where a long unbroken paragraph covers treatment conditioning, re-disclosure, 42 CFR Part 2, Wisconsin DHS regulations, and revocation rights with no visual breaks. Form-1 improves on this with bulleted "I understand that..." statements.
- **Record selection**: Unusually granular. Both forms separate Mental Health, Substance Use Treatment, and Psychiatry records into distinct categories with individual checkboxes — giving patients fine-grained control over sensitive disclosures.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness required. No in-person submission requirement. Fax submission is explicitly available (form-1). No fees are mentioned — neither disclosed as free nor quantified. No response time is stated, though form-1 provides an urgent fax line for requests "requiring a response within a week." The confusing citation of "Federal Privacy Law (42 CFR Part 2) (HIPAA)" incorrectly implies 42 CFR Part 2 is part of HIPAA, which could mislead patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Encrypted email delivery option for records (form-1)
- "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox on both forms
- Granular behavioral health record type selection
- Verbal revocation explicitly acknowledged (form-2)
- Clear treatment non-conditioning language
- Fillable PDF exists (form-2), showing digital investment capability

## Overall Assessment

NorthLakes Community Clinic provides a functional but unrefined patient access experience. The forms are easy to find, free of major barriers, and offer good record-type granularity. However, the organization funnels all patients through a generic ROI authorization designed for third-party transfers, with no dedicated patient access pathway. The regression from a fillable to a non-fillable primary form is a notable step backward. A patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience. **Grade: C (3.35/5.0).**

MUSC Health provides five documents related to medical records release: the current English authorization form (form-1, Rev. 10/2023, 2 pages), an older superseded version (form-2, Version 11, dated 11/2017), a dental-specific variant (form-3, Version 9, dated 5/2019), a MyChart instructions guide (form-4, 4 pages, dated 2017), and a Spanish translation of the current form (form-5). The primary form for patient self-access is form-1, the current "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information."

Critically, MUSC offers three distinct request pathways clearly presented on its medical records page: (1) MyChart Patient Portal for existing portal users, (2) an online eRequest wizard via Ciox/Swellbox for fully digital submission, and (3) manual form download for traditional mail/fax/email submission. This multi-pathway approach gives patients genuine flexibility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MUSC does differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — but at the process level, not the form level. The MyChart instructions document (form-4) explicitly states that MyChart is for patient self-requests, while the HIPAA authorization form should be used "for medical records to be sent directly to a physician office, hospital or third parties." The medical records webpage reinforces this distinction through its tabbed layout.

However, the downloadable PDF form itself (form-1) is a generic HIPAA authorization serving all purposes. "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" is listed as one purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care," "Legal," "Insurance," and others. The form does not distinguish the legal basis, fee structure, or processing rules for patient access under 45 CFR §164.524 versus third-party authorization — even though it cites that regulation. A patient using only the form must navigate a document designed around the third-party release paradigm.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability is excellent. The medical records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and all three pathways are clearly presented. Web searches for MUSC records release forms return direct PDF links. No bot-blocking or access difficulties were encountered. The form URLs are descriptive and intuitive. Both English and Spanish versions are co-located under a clearly labeled section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-authored, text-layered PDF with clean layout and logical flow: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Record Types → SUD Records → Purpose → Date Range → Release Method → Authorization/Consent → Signature. At two pages, the length is appropriate — page one handles all authorization substance, page two provides a useful facility contact directory for nine MUSC Health locations across South Carolina.

The most significant technical shortcoming is that the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being revised in October 2023. Patients must print the PDF and handwrite all entries, then fax, scan-and-email, or mail the completed form. This is a missed opportunity for a major academic medical center's current-revision document.

Record type options are granular and well-designed, including a dedicated Substance Use Disorder section with proper 42 CFR Part 2 citation and opt-in choices. Delivery options include mail, MyChart, fax, and encrypted email. However, the encrypted email option creates confusion: the checkbox says "Encrypted E-mail" but the accompanying consent language warns about "unencrypted e-mail" risks, leaving patients uncertain about what they're authorizing.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — not required by HIPAA — paired with a header warning that "FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION." Together, these could prevent a patient completing the form at home without a witness from submitting it.

Fee language references only South Carolina law ("fees may be charged as provided by S.C. Law") without acknowledging HIPAA's more restrictive cost-based fee limits for patient self-access requests. The MyChart instructions document goes further, stating a blanket fee "for all patient requests" with a prepayment requirement and no disclosed amounts — a notable compliance concern.

The form requires attaching a copy of photo identification, which is reasonable but adds friction for remote submission.

## Strengths

MUSC's standout features include: a **Spanish-language form** that faithfully mirrors the current English version with professional translation quality; **three clearly presented request pathways** including a fully digital portal option (Ciox/Swellbox); a **comprehensive nine-location facility directory** with fax numbers, phone numbers, and dedicated ROI email addresses; **granular SUD records consent** with correct 42 CFR Part 2 citation; and an **explicit citation of 45 CFR §164.524** (patient right of access).

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health demonstrates strong organizational infrastructure for records access — excellent findability, multiple pathways, bilingual support, and process-level differentiation between patient and third-party requests. However, the core downloadable form remains a generic authorization that doesn't center patient self-access, the PDF is not fillable despite a 2023 revision, and compliance details around fees and the witness requirement introduce unnecessary friction. The availability of the Ciox/Swellbox portal partially mitigates the form-level weaknesses by offering patients a fully digital alternative. Overall, this is a competent but not exceptional approach from a well-resourced teaching hospital.

# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Medical Center (CMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Toms River, NJ, part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also offers a Ciox/Swellbox online records request portal as the primary pathway for patients.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF documents were downloaded:

- **form-1.pdf** — A CMC-specific one-page "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility" (2017, image-only scan, no fillable fields). This is the legacy facility-level outbound release form.
- **form-2.pdf** — A one-page "Request for Release of Health Information *to* CMC" (2015/2021, image-only scan). This is an inbound records transfer form and is **not relevant** for a patient requesting their own records.
- **form-3.pdf** — The system-wide RWJBH "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (3 pages, Nov 2025, has text layer but no fillable fields). This is the most current and comprehensive form, covering all RWJBH locations. It is the best available PDF for patient self-access.

Beyond PDF forms, the medical records page prominently features a **Ciox/Swellbox online portal** for electronic records requests. Fax (732-557-2209) and email (cmcroimedicalrecords@rwjbh.org) submission options are also available.

## Patient Access Pathway

CMC does not offer a dedicated form specifically designed for patient self-access. Both the legacy CMC form (form-1) and the system-wide form (form-3) are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient access, third-party requests, insurance, legal, and continuing care. On form-3, "Personal" appears as a purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care/Treatment," "Insurance," and "Legal," but the patient must name themselves as the recipient in a field clearly designed for third-party organizations. The Swellbox online portal, however, may provide a more patient-centric experience as a purpose-built records request tool, and the organization directs patients toward it as the primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was straightforward. A direct web search for CMC medical records authorization returned the facility's medical records page immediately. The page links to the CMC-specific forms and references the online portal. The system-wide form (form-3) required a separate search at the RWJBH system level. No bot blocking or authentication barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing form-3 (the best available PDF): the document has a text layer and clean digital rendering (created in Word, not scanned), but **lacks fillable fields** — a patient must print it and complete it by hand. The layout is well-organized with a logical flow: patient demographics → facility selection → recipient → delivery method → record types → purpose → legal terms → signature. Record type selection is granular (15+ checkboxes including behavioral health, pathology, and imaging). Page 3 provides a helpful contact directory for all RWJBH facility HIM departments. Legal text on page 2 is dense but not impenetrably so. The facility checkbox grid on page 1 is visually crowded but functional. The older CMC-specific forms (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans with zero accessibility — no text layer, no fillable fields, no screen reader support.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-3 includes anti-conditioning language ("my refusal will not affect the start, continuation or quality of my medical treatment") and clear revocation rights. No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is **vague**: records are free when sent to another provider for care, but "there may be a fee" for other requests with no schedule or amounts provided. HIPAA cost-based fee limits for patient access are not mentioned. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The 180-day authorization expiration is reasonable.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods** on form-3: paper pickup, US Mail, encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format" — far better than most ROI forms.
- **Online portal** (Swellbox) provides a fully digital pathway alongside PDF forms.
- **Comprehensive contact directory** (page 3) with phone and fax for every RWJBH HIM department.
- **Multiple submission channels**: fax, email, online portal, and mail.

## Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any PDF form despite digital creation.
- **Generic authorization form** — no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow.
- **Opaque fee disclosure** — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.
- **Legacy CMC forms** (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans that remain linked on the website alongside the modern system-wide form, creating potential confusion.

## Overall Assessment

Community Medical Center earns a **B** overall. The organization benefits significantly from the Swellbox online portal and strong delivery method options on the system-wide form. The retrieval experience is easy and multiple submission channels exist. However, the PDF forms are non-fillable and generic, the fee disclosure is vague, and there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow. The coexistence of legacy image-only scans alongside a modern system-wide form reflects incomplete digital modernization.

# Maury Regional Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Maury Regional Health, a nonprofit regional system based in Columbia, TN (encompassing Maury Regional Medical Center, Marshall Medical Center, Wayne Medical Center, and Maury Regional Medical Group), provides a reasonably accessible records request experience with several notable strengths — particularly multilingual availability and multiple delivery channels — but falls short of best-in-class by relying on a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms were found, both linked from the Medical Records page (`/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/`):

- **Form 1 (Form 131, 08/2018):** English-language "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a single-page, general-purpose ROI form.
- **Form 2 (Form 131S, 05/2017):** Spanish-language translation of the same form, though dated over a year earlier and containing content discrepancies.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, the medical records page also offers an **online request portal via Swellbox** and access through the **My Maury Health Patient Portal**, giving patients three distinct channels. Fax submission (931.380.4092) and phone contact (931.380.4089) are also listed.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Maury Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form serves all purposes — requesting your own records, releasing to an attorney, sending to an insurer, etc. However, the form does accommodate patient access by listing "Myself" as the first option in the recipient field and including "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox. A patient can use this form, but must navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios (specifying a recipient name/address, selecting among purposes that don't apply). The availability of the Swellbox online portal is a meaningful alternative that may provide a more streamlined patient experience, though the portal itself was not evaluated in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A site-scoped search immediately surfaced the medical records page. The page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Medical Records). PDFs are hosted on Cloudinary CDN and downloaded without authentication or bot blocking. The only minor difficulty was a 403 error from the web_fetch tool on the medical records page, requiring browser fallback — but the PDFs themselves downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (Form 131) is a clean, single-page, digitally-created PDF — not a scan. It has a proper text layer enabling screen reader access and text search. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring handwriting after printing. The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (demographics → direction of release → purpose → date range → record types → format → consent → signature) and uses reasonable visual hierarchy with checkboxes and section groupings. Language is a blend of plain English and necessary legal terminology — the consent bullets are clearly written, though the sensitive information disclosure section is dense.

The form offers an unusually good set of **four delivery format options**: paper copies, CD, USB flash drive, and encrypted email — with a thoughtful security disclosure about email risks.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required.**
- **No fees disclosed** — the form says nothing about costs.
- **Hold harmless clause** is a red flag: "The facility is hereby released and discharged of any liability, and I will hold the facility harmless for complying with this authorization." HIPAA does not permit conditioning access on signing a liability release.
- **90-day authorization expiration** is relatively short but within norms.
- **Photo ID verification** on the English form implies in-person submission, though the website lists fax as an option.
- **No response time commitment** stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — uncommon among community hospitals in this study.
- **Multiple request channels** (PDF, Swellbox portal, patient portal, fax, phone).
- **Encrypted email delivery** option with proactive security disclosure.
- **"Myself" listed first** in the recipient field — a subtle but meaningful patient-centric design choice.

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must use a generic authorization form.
- **Non-fillable PDF** — requires printing and handwriting.
- **Spanish form is outdated** (05/2017 vs. 08/2018 English) with missing content (no Social Security/Disability purpose, no Photo ID section).
- **Hold harmless clause** is potentially noncompliant for patient access requests.
- **Sensitive information limitation** is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to exercise it.

## Overall Assessment

Maury Regional Health provides an accessible, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process with commendable multilingual support and multiple submission channels. The main shortcomings are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, a non-fillable PDF form, and a potentially problematic liability waiver. The availability of the Swellbox online portal partially compensates for the PDF's limitations, and the overall experience is adequate — a patient can successfully request their own records without undue difficulty, though the process could be more patient-centric.

# U.S. Dermatology Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides a single ROI form — "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — available as a one-page PDF from their Patient Forms page. Two copies were found online: form-1.pdf (uploaded March 2020, currently linked) and form-2.pdf (uploaded June 2019, orphaned but still publicly accessible). Both contain identical text, with a revision footer of "Rev 08/2017," indicating the content has not been substantively updated in nearly nine years. For patient self-access purposes, form-1.pdf is the relevant document.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Instead, it uses a generic HIPAA authorization form that bundles patient self-access with third-party release scenarios. "Patient Access" appears as one checkbox among five under "Purpose of Use/Disclosure," alongside "To Doctor," "To Insurance," "To Attorney," and "Other." The overall framing — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure" — is oriented toward third-party release, and a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form structure designed for a different purpose. For example, the recipient section asks for "Name of individual or organization" and its address, which is confusing when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" surfaced the PDF directly, and the Patient Forms page at `usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/` has a clearly labeled "Medical Records Release" link. No bot blocking, login wall, or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields** (`fillable_field_count: 0`), requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and physically sign. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow with clear sections for patient identification, disclosure direction, delivery method, purpose, date range, record types, and rights disclosures. Language is somewhat legalistic but generally readable. The form lacks instructions on where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is provided.

## Delivery and Submission

The form lists three delivery options for records: mailed, faxed, or electronic (patient portal only). However, these describe how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself is *submitted*. The form is silent on submission method, leaving patients without guidance. Given the lack of submission instructions and the non-fillable PDF, the workflow is effectively: download → print → hand-fill → unknown submission. The patient forms page and general website would likely require calling the office to determine where to send it; fax is presumably available once the patient contacts the office.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions**: The most significant usability gap. A patient who completes the form has no idea where to send it.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure," bundled into the authorization with no opt-out. This is overreaching for patient self-access requests.
- **Vague fee language**: "A reasonable fee may be charged for the records" does not distinguish patient-access requests (HIPAA-limited) from third-party releases, and gives no indication of actual costs.
- **Typo**: "IDS" instead of "AIDS" in the sensitive information disclosure — uncorrected since 2017.
- **No response time commitment**: No mention of turnaround time or the 30-day HIPAA requirement.
- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive fields despite being a digitally created PDF.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: The entire authorization fits on one page without being cramped — a respectful use of patient time.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment" is unambiguous and well-placed.
- **Easy online findability**: Directly linked from a well-organized Patient Forms page with clear labeling.
- **Patient rights disclosures**: Five bullet points covering right to a copy, right to inspect, right to revoke, voluntariness, and sensitive information notice.

## Overall Assessment

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides an easily findable, concise ROI form that technically accommodates patient self-access through a checkbox — but the form is fundamentally a third-party authorization repurposed for all disclosure scenarios. The lack of fillable fields, missing submission instructions, bundled liability waiver, and vague fee language collectively create a paper-era experience with notable friction points. The form has not been meaningfully updated since 2017. A patient can likely get their records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Proliance Surgeons — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Proliance Surgeons is a large, independent, for-profit physician practice group based in Seattle, WA, comprising multiple member practices (ProOrtho, Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, Northwest Physicians Specialists/MRI, Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons, and others). Four documents were retrieved: two nearly identical outgoing ROI authorization forms (form-2 from the main site, form-4 from ProOrtho), an image-only scan of a similar form (form-1 from NPS/MRI), and an incoming records transfer form (form-3 from Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons). The main medical records page also references Datavant as an online ROI partner, though the portal was not evaluated directly.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Proliance Surgeons does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. All outgoing ROI forms (form-1, form-2, form-4) use the same generic HIPAA authorization template ("Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information"), which is designed for third-party disclosure under § 164.508. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address as the "recipient" — an awkward workflow that conflates patient access rights (§ 164.524) with third-party authorization. The form does include an "at my request" reason checkbox, but the structure assumes disclosure to an external party. There is no mention of HIPAA Right of Access, no format/delivery preference field, and no reference to timelines or fee limitations specific to individual access.

The mention of Datavant on the medical records page suggests an online portal option exists, which would provide a more streamlined pathway, but the PDF forms themselves are the only downloadable option found.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A basic web search immediately surfaced multiple PDFs, and the main Proliance medical records page (proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links directly to the primary form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The main challenge is fragmentation: different member practices host their own versions of the same template, and a patient arriving at a subsidiary site (npsmri.com, proortho.com) may find a different version than the canonical one on the main site, with no cross-referencing between versions.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf** (ProOrtho), which is textually identical to form-2 but was noted to have interactive checkboxes (though metadata reports 0 AcroForm fields, suggesting non-standard implementation). Both are single-page, cleanly structured documents with two clear sections: "I. My Authorization" and "II. My Rights." The language is relatively plain, written in first person ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), and the layout is logical. Scope options are well-granulated (all records, condition-specific, date-specific, plus sensitive categories requiring explicit opt-in per Washington State law). However, neither form has true fillable text fields — patients must print and handwrite all entries. Form-2 includes a practice-specific fax number (425.820.8975) for submission; form-4 lacks any submission instructions entirely.

Form-1 is an image-only scan at 150 DPI with no text layer — completely inaccessible to screen readers and unsearchable. It represents the worst-case scenario a patient might encounter if they land on the NPS/MRI subsidiary site.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness requirement** — a positive.
- **No fees disclosed** — neutral; avoids deterrence but leaves patients uninformed.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax submission is available via form-2.
- **No electronic signature option** — requires printing and wet signature.
- **No response time stated** — patients have no expectation for turnaround.
- **Practice-specific contact info** baked into one form variant, creating confusion for patients at other Proliance locations.

## Notable Strengths

- **Concise one-page format** that covers all essential authorization elements without clutter.
- **Sensitive information categories** properly separated with individual opt-in checkboxes (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), compliant with Washington State RCW 70.02.
- **First-person rights language** in the "My Rights" section, which is more patient-friendly than typical third-person legal boilerplate.
- **Clear revocation instructions** with two specific methods (revocation form or letter).
- **Datavant portal mentioned** on the medical records page as an online alternative.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **Generic authorization form conflated with patient access** — no dedicated Right of Access pathway.
- **No fillable text fields** — print-and-handwrite workflow despite being a digitally-created document.
- **Fragmentation across subsidiaries** — multiple versions with inconsistent quality and no cross-referencing.
- **Form-1 is an image-only scan** — a digital accessibility failure.
- **Form-3 cites wrong state law** (California CMIA instead of Washington RCW 70.02) and wrong HIPAA year (2003 vs. 1996).

## Overall Assessment

Proliance Surgeons provides a readily findable, concise authorization form with reasonable content design and no major procedural barriers. However, the organization falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all record requests through a generic third-party authorization form with no differentiation for individual access. The print-and-handwrite workflow and subsidiary fragmentation further diminish the experience. The mention of Datavant as an online option is promising but not reflected in the downloadable forms themselves. Overall grade: **C** — adequate but not designed around patient self-access.

# Millinocket Regional Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Millinocket Regional Hospital provides a single downloadable PDF form: an **"Authorization to Release Health Care Information"** document hosted on its website since at least 2014. This is the only records-related form found for the organization. There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The sole pathway for a patient requesting records is to download this two-page PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — most likely via fax to the number listed in the form header ((207) 723-3019).

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

The form does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. It is structured entirely around a third-party disclosure model: the patient authorizes "Name of Institution" to disclose records to another "Name of Institution or Person." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. The "reason for release" field offers only "continuing care" or "other (please specify)" — there is no option for "personal records request" or "individual access under HIPAA." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form repurposed for all release scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required persistence. Two generic web searches returned no results; only a site-scoped query (`site:mrhme.org`) succeeded. The form does not appear to be prominently linked from a patient resources or medical records page. The URL path (`/2014/06/`) suggests the document has not been updated in over a decade. Once located, the download was straightforward — no bot blocking or browser fallback needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat PDF with zero fillable fields**. All data entry uses underscore blanks designed for handwriting. The document has a text layer (not a scan) and uses four fonts, but it is fundamentally a print-and-fill artifact. The layout lacks section headers, visual hierarchy, or any design elements beyond bold title text. Record types are presented as an 18-item list (a–r) using an unusual **opt-out approach**: items are released unless crossed out, which uses double-negative logic that could easily confuse patients.

The form covers patient identification, sender/recipient institution, record type selection, reason for release, sensitive information consent (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric), and signature lines — approximately 25 fields across two pages. The language is mostly plain but includes alarming legalese: *"refusal or revocation of permission may result in improper diagnosis or treatment, denial of health benefits or insurance, or other adverse consequences"* — a warning that applies to third-party release scenarios but could discourage a patient exercising their right of access.

## Barriers & Red Flags

The form mandates: *"All spaces on this form MUST be completed for this release to be valid."* This blanket requirement goes beyond HIPAA's authorization elements and could be used to reject forms with trivially missing information. A **witness signature line** is included; combined with the all-fields-mandatory language, this effectively requires a witness — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, no response time is stated, and no delivery format options are offered.

## Bright Spots

The **18-category record-type checklist** provides meaningful granularity, including unusual categories like "Patient Additions" and "Responses to Patients Additions." The **sensitive information consent sections** correctly reference redisclosure restrictions for substance abuse records under 42 CFR Part 2. The form does include a brief patient rights statement acknowledging the right to review records and revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Millinocket Regional Hospital's records request process reflects a facility that has not modernized its patient access pathway. A single generic third-party release form — non-fillable, hard to find, and over a decade old — serves as the only documented mechanism. The form was not designed for patient self-access and contains unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, all-fields-mandatory mandate). While fax submission is available and the form provides good record-type granularity, the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# Fenway Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fenway Health, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Boston, MA, provides a cohesive three-document records-release package: an English ROI authorization form (form-1), a companion FAQ guide (form-2), and a Spanish translation of the ROI form (form-3). The forms are easy to find, submission channels are plentiful, and the organization demonstrates genuine care for its patient population through thoughtful design choices — but it does not offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway, instead routing all records requests through a generic third-party authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

The primary form is titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" and is structured around a FROM/TO model: "I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM: Sender/Facility's name... TO: Recipient/Facility's name." This framing is designed for provider-to-provider transfers — a patient wanting their own records must write their personal name and address into the "Recipient/Facility's name" field, which is unintuitive. There is no checkbox for "send records to me" and no separate patient access form. The organization does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization.

Fenway Health also offers MyChart patient portal access, which provides a separate digital pathway, but the downloadable form itself is firmly a generic authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Fenway Health's forms was straightforward — a simple web search immediately returned the PDF URL and the dedicated medical records page at fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was needed. The organization maintains a clean, dedicated medical records landing page with clear submission instructions. This is a best-case retrieval scenario.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a clean text layer and 7 fonts — clearly designed with care in a layout tool. However, it contains zero fillable fields, which is a significant missed opportunity. Despite being digitally created, patients must print, hand-fill, and then scan or fax the form. The layout follows a logical 7-section flow (patient info → sender → recipient → reason → record type → sensitive info → signature) and fits on one page, though the density is notable. The legal notice in Section 7 is a single 130-word block mixing authorization scope, revocation rights, reproductive health protections, and substance abuse protections — challenging to parse.

Section 6 (Sensitive Information) stands out: it requires individual patient initials for 10 categories of sensitive health information, including abortion care, gender-affirming care, HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, and substance use treatment. This granularity gives patients unusually fine-grained control over disclosure.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fenway Health imposes no unreasonable barriers. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person mandate, and no fees mentioned. Submission channels include mail, fax, email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org), and MyChart portal — four pathways, all adequate for remote submission. The form clearly states revocation rights and a one-year authorization validity period. Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (in the FAQ sheet), well within HIPAA's 30-day requirement. The sensitive information initials requirement, while thorough, could function as a processing delay trigger if patients skip it — the bold warning "COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING" has a somewhat coercive tone.

## Notable Strengths

Fenway Health's standout feature is the companion FAQ sheet (form-2) — a 3-page plain-language guide that walks patients through every section of the ROI form, defining terms like "bi-directional" and "abstract" that would otherwise be opaque. Very few healthcare organizations create separate instructional documents for their ROI forms. The Spanish-language form (form-3) demonstrates commitment to language access, though no Spanish FAQ exists. The inclusion of Massachusetts-specific shield-law language protecting reproductive health and gender-affirming care records reflects both legal compliance and organizational mission. The "Name used (if different)" field thoughtfully accommodates patients whose current name differs from their legal name.

## Weaknesses

The most significant weakness is the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway. The FROM/TO structure is designed for third-party release and does not clearly serve a patient requesting their own records. The lack of fillable fields on a born-digital PDF is a technical oversight that forces an unnecessary print-handwrite-scan workflow. The Spanish form's contact block reverts to English ("Mail/Fax to:", "Attn: Medical Records Dept"), undermining the translation effort.

## Overall Assessment

Fenway Health earns a solid B. The organization demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its FAQ guide, multilingual forms, and sensitive information protections, but falls short on the two key assessment dimensions: it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, and its form is not digitally fillable despite being born-digital. A patient can successfully request their records through this process, but the form was not designed with that use case as a first-class concern.

# Alabama Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Alabama Medical Group, P.C. is an independent, for-profit, multi-specialty physician practice based in Mobile, Alabama. The organization maintains a well-organized website with a dedicated Patient Resources section, including a clearly labeled "Request Medical Records" page. Two forms were found and evaluated: a general-purpose "Request for Release of Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a narrow "Permission to Give Medical Information" form (form-2.pdf) for authorizing family phone access. Only form-1 is relevant for a patient seeking their own records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Third-Party Authorization

Alabama Medical Group does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-1, a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form titled "Request for Release of Information." The form is structured around "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" fields — language designed for inter-provider and third-party transfers, not for a patient requesting their own records. A patient would need to place their own name and address in the "Release To" field, which is workable but not intuitive.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access anywhere on the form. The form frames the entire interaction as consent-to-release rather than as an exercise of a legal right. The purpose checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Evaluation & Treatment, Other) further confirm this is designed for third-party scenarios — a patient requesting their own records would likely select "Other" and write in an explanation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The website is well-organized with a clear path: Patient Resources → Medical Records → Request Medical Records. The form is linked directly from that page as a PDF download. The same form also appears on the "Other Patient Forms" page. No bot blocking, no browser fallback needed, and no significant difficulties were encountered. The duplicate hosting (identical file at two URLs uploaded one month apart) is a minor organizational issue but does not impair access.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but **no fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects patient name (including maiden name), date of birth, Social Security Number, medical record number, recipient/source information with address/phone/fax, purpose, type of information (free-text), sensitive information consent, and multiple signature lines. The field count is approximately 15–18 data points.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow and fits on one page, though this density makes it somewhat cramped. Language is a mix of plain English for identification fields and standard legal boilerplate for the authorization terms. The example prompt for specifying record type — "(Example: Office Notes, Labs, In-Office Testing, all records)" — is a helpful touch. The dual signature block for sensitive information consent (specifically permitting vs. specifically not permitting) gives patients clear control.

However, the form lacks submission instructions — no mailing address, fax number, or email address is printed on it. A patient who downloads the PDF would not know how to return it without navigating back to the website or calling the office. There is also no date range field, no delivery format options, and no mention of electronic delivery.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests a Social Security Number as a standard field, which is unnecessary for a medical records request and creates an identity theft risk. The **employee/witness signature line** at the bottom is ambiguous — if required, it would effectively mandate in-person submission, a significant barrier not required by HIPAA. **No fees are mentioned** on the form, which leaves uncertainty about costs. **No response time** is stated.

The form was uploaded in February 2018 and has apparently not been updated since, suggesting the organization has not revisited its records request process in approximately eight years.

## Notable Strengths

- Easy findability with clear website navigation
- Concise one-page form
- Helpful example text for record type specification
- Clean sensitive information consent design with explicit opt-in/opt-out

## Overall Assessment

Alabama Medical Group provides a **functional but dated** records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it funnels patients through a generic third-party release authorization with no acknowledgment of patient access rights. The flat PDF with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no electronic submission pathway creates a primarily paper-based workflow. The SSN collection and ambiguous witness requirement are concerning. This is a practice that has not modernized its records access process to reflect current patient expectations or HIPAA right-of-access principles.

# Ascension St. Vincent's East — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension St. Vincent's East is a community hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the Ascension health system that has recently partnered with or been rebranded under UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). This branding transition is the defining feature of the patient experience: two forms exist on two different websites under two different organizational names, and a patient searching under the facility's commonly known name may land on the wrong (legacy) form.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF authorization forms were found:

- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An Ascension St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization To Disclose Protected Health Information" revised February 2022, hosted on `healthcare.ascension.org` in a URL path containing the word "legacy." This 2.8 MB, 2-page form is a general-purpose ROI authorization with no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. It collects Social Security Number, lists notarized signature among identity verification options, and requires a witness signature — all potential barriers. On the positive side, it explicitly cites CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access).

- **form-2.pdf** (current): A UAB St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records" dated February 2026, hosted on `uabstvincents.org`. This is the current, most relevant form. At 143 KB and 2 pages, it is a cleaner, digital-origin document. It explicitly lists "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department" as a selectable location and includes a checkbox for "me for my personal use" — a meaningful distinction from forms that only contemplate third-party release.

The best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-2, which accommodates patient self-access as a first-class option alongside third-party authorization.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Form-2 does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release via a checkbox ("me for my personal use" vs. "the party indicated below"). This is a genuine improvement over many ROI forms and over this facility's own predecessor form. However, form-2 remains a generic authorization form — not a dedicated patient access request form. The same form, same legal language, and same process apply whether the patient wants their own records or is authorizing release to an insurer or attorney. A patient must navigate legal language about re-disclosure, initial two dense paragraphs about revocation and non-conditioning, and understand which fields apply to their scenario.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form required moderate effort. Initial searches for "Ascension St. Vincent's East" yielded system-wide Ascension forms from other states. An Alabama-specific search found the legacy form-1 on the Ascension domain. Only a separate search for "UAB St. Vincent's" uncovered the current form-2 on the UAB domain. A patient who knows this facility by its Ascension name would likely find only the outdated 2022 form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed — both PDFs downloaded directly.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a digital-origin PDF with a text layer, reasonable file size, and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all entries must be handwritten after printing. The form uses horizontal rules to separate sections and offers a well-designed tiered record selection (Key Clinical Notes bundle, Entire Medical Record, or specific report types). The "Key Clinical Notes" option — pre-defined as discharge summary, operative reports, labs, radiology, and ED documentation — is a genuine usability bright spot that helps patients who don't know medical terminology.

The opening paragraph front-loads dense legal language before the patient even fills in their name. The form contains a contradictory treatment of sensitive records: the opening paragraph states the request "includes" psychiatric and substance use information, while a later checkbox asks whether to include it. The submission instructions are indirect — rather than printing a mailing address, the form directs patients to visit a website.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-2 removes several barriers present in the legacy form: no Social Security Number field, no notarization option, no witness requirement. Non-conditioning and revocation rights are clearly stated (with initialing required). However, the form provides no fee disclosure whatsoever — patients have no idea what records will cost. The HIPAA Right of Access citation (CFR 164.524) present in form-1 was dropped in form-2, a notable regression. Submission appears limited to physical mail; no fax number or electronic submission option for the completed form is stated.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension St. Vincent's East earns credit for a reasonably well-designed authorization form that explicitly accommodates patient self-access with a personal-use checkbox and offers tiered record selection. However, the experience is undermined by the branding transition that makes the current form hard to find, zero fillable fields requiring a fully paper workflow, apparent mail-only form submission, and absent fee disclosure. The result is a facility that has the right instincts on patient-centeredness but falls short on digital accessibility and transparency.

# Desert Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Regional Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Palm Springs, CA, operated by Desert Care Network, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare. Two forms were found: an English-language ROI authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are 2-page digitally created PDFs available from a dedicated medical records page on the Desert Care Network website.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

Desert Regional does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization for the Release of Health Information" and are structured as third-party disclosure authorizations — the patient authorizes Desert Regional to release records *to* a named recipient. A patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient, an awkward workaround that conflates the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) with the authorization framework of § 164.508. There is no separate form, section, or instructions addressing patient self-access as a distinct use case.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient/patient representative" as one option, but "Continuation of Care" appears as the default/first option, further underscoring the form's third-party orientation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A direct `filetype:pdf` search yielded nothing, but a site-specific search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/patients/request-medical-records`. That page is well-organized, with per-hospital download links in both English and Spanish. Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic downloads, requiring browser-based workarounds — though a patient using a standard browser would not encounter this. Overall, the form is roughly 2–3 clicks from the homepage via a logical navigation path.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is digitally authored with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite. This is a significant missed opportunity given the digital-native construction. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, recipient info, 12 record-type checkboxes, date range, purpose, and delivery method. The layout is logical and readable, following a clear top-to-bottom sequence. Language tilts toward legal/administrative but is not impenetrably dense; the rights section uses standard HIPAA authorization language with four-exception conditional clauses that could benefit from plain-language explanation.

Delivery method options include patient pickup, mail, fax, and email — the inclusion of email is a positive differentiator. The form header provides phone, fax, and email contact for the HIM department, giving patients multiple submission channels.

## Spanish Translation Quality

The Spanish form (form-2.pdf) mirrors the English version in structure and content, but suffers from **pervasive typographical errors** — at least 9 distinct misspellings including "APCIENTE" (PACIENTE), "cofidencialidad" (confidencialidad), and "DIVILGACIÓN" (DIVULGACIÓN). More consequentially, the Spanish form **omits the delivery method section** entirely, meaning Spanish-speaking patients cannot indicate how they want to receive their records. The fax number in the Spanish header also appears truncated. These errors suggest the translation was not professionally reviewed and create a meaningful disparity in service quality for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no mandatory in-person submission, and no explicit fee requirements. Revocation rights and authorization expiration are clearly stated. However, the form says nothing about fees — neither disclosing them nor stating they don't apply for patient access. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, and the rights section covers only authorization-related rights (voluntariness, revocation). There is no mention of electronic health information export or the patient's right to receive records in their requested format.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful for the Coachella Valley's large Spanish-speaking population
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear, per-hospital download links
- **Email as a delivery option** is more progressive than many ROI forms
- **Multiple HIM contact channels** (phone, fax, email) on the form header

## Overall Assessment

Desert Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The primary pathway is a generic third-party release form with no differentiation for patient self-access — a common but patient-unfriendly pattern. The form is reasonably well-organized and findable, but the lack of fillable fields and the poor quality of the Spanish translation diminish the overall experience. A patient can submit via fax or email (adequate electronic pathways), but must first print and handwrite the form. The organization earns credit for bilingual availability and a clear website presence, but falls short on patient-centeredness and digital accessibility.

# Erie Family Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erie Family Health Centers, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Chicago, provides two downloaded ROI forms: an English version (form-1.pdf) and a Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are identical in structure — a single-page "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form. The organization also directs patients to MyChart (myeriehealth.com) as the primary records access pathway, referenced on a dedicated medical records request page at `/recordsrequest/`.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Erie does **not** offer a dedicated patient-access form. Both downloaded forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for bidirectional use: releasing records *to* a third party or receiving records *from* a third party. A patient requesting their own records must select "to Release to" and write their own name and address in the recipient fields — a process designed for inter-provider transfers, not individual access. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under the purpose section, which accommodates self-requests but does not differentiate the pathway. There is no separate, simplified form for patients exercising their Right of Access under § 164.524.

That said, the records request page promotes MyChart as the primary way to access records, which provides a true patient-access pathway. The PDF form functions as a secondary or fallback option.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search for "Erie Family Health Centers medical records release form PDF" returned the direct URL. The organization maintains a clearly labeled `/recordsrequest/` page that links both English and Spanish PDFs and also promotes MyChart. No bot blocking, login walls, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with **54 fillable fields**. It was designed for digital completion, not a scan. However, field names are not programmatically labeled (empty `fillable_field_names` array), which impairs screen reader accessibility. The layout is logically organized — patient identification, authorization direction, purpose, format, delivery method, record types, date range, sensitive-category permissions, rights statement, and signature — all on one dense page.

The language is reasonably clear for an authorization form, though the legal disclaimers at the bottom (addressing re-disclosure restrictions under Illinois mental health, substance abuse, and AIDS confidentiality laws) are dense and directed at the receiving party rather than the patient. The reference to "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" is cryptic — no pay scale is provided or linked, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs.

Format options include paper copy or "Electronic copy (CD-ROM)" — the CD-ROM reference is outdated. Delivery methods include encrypted email, pickup at an Erie facility, fax, and US postal mail. Encrypted email is a notable modern inclusion.

## Barriers

- **Copy of ID required** as a blanket requirement, with no alternative verification methods offered. For an FQHC serving populations that may lack government-issued ID, this exceeds what HIPAA mandates for identity verification.
- **Witness signature line** present with no indication of whether it is required or optional, potentially creating an unnecessary procedural barrier.
- **Fee opacity**: "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" references an undisclosed fee schedule. Patients cannot learn costs before submitting.
- **No notarization** required. No in-person submission requirement. Auto-expiration at six months is reasonable.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both English and Spanish versions are provided and linked side-by-side — appropriate and commendable for a Chicago FQHC.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: A modern, patient-friendly option that many organizations omit.
- **Dedicated records request page**: Clear `/recordsrequest/` page contextualizes forms and promotes MyChart as an alternative.
- **Granular record selection**: Nine specific record categories plus "Other" let patients request exactly what they need.
- **MyChart availability**: The patient portal provides a true digital-first access pathway beyond the PDF form.

## Overall Assessment

Erie Family Health Centers earns a **B grade** (3.70 weighted score). The organization makes its forms easy to find, offers bilingual versions, provides a fillable PDF with modern delivery options including encrypted email, and maintains a dedicated records page. These are genuine strengths, especially for an independent FQHC. However, the lack of a dedicated patient-access pathway (funneling all requestors through a generic third-party authorization form), the undisclosed fee schedule, the blanket ID copy requirement, and the ambiguous witness signature line prevent a higher score. The MyChart portal partially compensates by offering patients a true self-service pathway, but the PDF form itself — the focus of this evaluation — treats patient self-access as just another use case rather than a first-class right.

# Western Washington Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Everett, WA. Three ROI-related documents were retrieved: a primary organization-wide fillable authorization form (form-1), a GI department-specific non-fillable release form (form-2), and a generic unbranded authorization hosted on PatientPop (form-3). Form-1 is clearly the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records and is the basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WWMG does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Western Washington Medical Group to RELEASE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION" — a standard third-party release authorization. Patients requesting their own records use the same form as those authorizing release to an attorney, insurer, or another provider. "Personal (to patient)" appears as one of several purpose checkboxes, annotated with "*service fee may apply." There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal option for record requests. The form does not reference the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish individual access rights from third-party authorization. A patient must navigate a form designed around sending records to someone else and adapt it for self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search returned direct PDF links, and WWMG maintains a dedicated Medical Records Request page (wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/) that links to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or portal requirements were encountered. The URL is descriptive and the form is also listed on the Patient Intake and Registration Forms page. The only complication is the existence of three forms — a patient could potentially encounter the inferior GI-specific (form-2) or orphaned PatientPop form (form-3) instead of the primary one, though the website clearly surfaces form-1.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a single-page fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — well above average for healthcare ROI forms. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → record scope → sensitive information exclusions → purpose → expiration → signature. The language is relatively plain, with direct instructions like "PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE." The scope options are strong, offering four ways to define what records are released (all within 3 years, specific condition, specific dates, or mutual exchange). The sensitive information exclusion section gives patients granular control over HIV, STD, psychiatric, and substance abuse records using an opt-out model with required initials.

The form is not a scan — it was designed digitally with clean text, multiple fonts, and embedded branding. At 143 KB for a single page, it is appropriately sized. WWMG's address is pre-filled, reducing patient burden.

## Submission and Delivery

The form directs patients to "visit wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request and refer to the contact info on the chart" for submission instructions, rather than listing submission options directly on the form. The "OFFICE USE ONLY" section indicates records can be faxed, mailed, or emailed — confirming electronic submission pathways exist. This indirect approach adds a step but avoids restricting patients to in-person delivery. Fax availability means patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or witness signature is required. However, two issues stand out:

1. **Vague fee language**: The "*service fee may apply" note next to "Personal (to patient)" is concerning. HIPAA limits fees for patient access to reasonable, cost-based amounts, and this language provides no specifics, potentially discouraging patients or leading to overcharging.

2. **Misleading "ALL" scope**: The "ALL healthcare information" option is silently limited to the last 3 years. A patient seeking their complete history must use the "Specific DATES" option, but this limitation is not explained. The word "ALL" is misleading.

The 90-day default authorization expiration is adequate for patient access requests (HIPAA requires fulfillment within 30 days with one extension) but creates unnecessary re-authorization burden for ongoing provider exchanges. A conflicting 1-year expiration for the "mutual exchange" option adds confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — genuinely digital-first design
- Single-page format that fits all necessary elements concisely
- Strong scope options with granular sensitive-information exclusion controls
- Multi-clinic awareness field routing requests to the correct WWMG location
- Easy-to-find forms with a dedicated Medical Records Request page

## Overall Assessment

WWMG provides a technically competent, well-designed authorization form that is easy to find and fill out digitally. However, it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — patients must navigate a generic authorization form and select the "Personal" purpose checkbox. The vague fee language for patient access is a compliance concern. The form's document quality and digital-first design are above average, but the lack of a patient-centered access pathway keeps this from being an exemplary practice.

# WakeMed Health & Hospitals — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

WakeMed Health & Hospitals provides a single ROI authorization form ("Authorization to Release Medical Information," N-935, revised 11/25) available in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf, N-935S). These are the same form translated — not separate documents for different purposes. Both are linked from the Health Information Management (HIM) page under Patients and Visitors → Medical Records. There is no online portal, no web-based request wizard, and no dedicated patient-access form. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it by hand, and submitting via email (HIMROI@Wakemed.org), fax (919-350-1720), or mail.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

WakeMed does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization that covers both releasing and obtaining PHI. A patient requesting their own records selects "Personal" from a list of five purposes (Billing/Insurance, Patient Care, Personal, Legal, Other) and must fill in a "Recipient" field — a concept that doesn't map cleanly when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form asks for the name of the "Person, Organization, or Facility you want us to release your PHI to," which creates an awkward fit for a simple "send me my records" request. This is a generic_hipaa_auth pathway, not a patient-centric design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A web search for WakeMed's ROI authorization immediately surfaced the correct page. The only friction was that an older URL (/assets/documents/...) was stale and returned HTML, requiring navigation to the HIM page to locate the current PDF links under /sites/default/files/pdf/. Once there, both language versions are clearly labeled and downloadable without bot blocking or access restrictions. Difficulty: moderate — easy via search, but required one redirect.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. Checkboxes are rendered as the letter "o" in text, and blanks are underscores — a purely print-and-handwrite design. The form has a text layer (not an image scan), so the content is readable on screen, but a patient cannot complete it digitally without third-party annotation tools.

Layout and organization are strong points. The 2-page form flows logically: patient/recipient information → record types and date ranges → format and delivery preferences (page 1), then understanding/consent → authorization/signature → revocation → contact information (page 2). Section headers are bold and uppercase. Record type selection is granular, with specific options for office visits, hospital admissions, ED visits, imaging studies, and sub-components like discharge summaries and lab reports. The date-of-visit field is flexibly worded ("Specify the date, date range, or other specific description of your visit").

Language is reasonably plain, though the UNDERSTANDING section on page 2 leans toward legal formality with a series of "I understand..." statements. These are necessary disclosures (re-disclosure risk, revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment) but add density.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No unnecessary barriers**: No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission. Multiple electronic submission channels (email and fax). Identity verification is mentioned but framed permissively ("proof of my identity... may be requested").

**Fee disclosure is vague**: The form warns that "any and/or all" requests and large-volume requests are processed by WakeMed's copy service and "a fee will be charged," but provides no schedule, estimate, or reference to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based standard. A patient cannot predict costs before submitting.

**Notable bright spots**: (1) A Spanish-language version exists — uncommon in this study — though it has translation gaps, with key field labels ("Address where you want your PHI sent to," "Email address") remaining in English. (2) Six delivery methods are offered: mail, fax, pick up, onsite review, MyChart (for records after 2/1/2015), and email with encrypted delivery as the default. (3) Email submission of the form itself removes a significant access barrier. (4) The form was recently revised (11/25), suggesting active maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

WakeMed provides a competent, well-organized ROI form with multiple submission and delivery channels, a Spanish translation, and no major procedural barriers. Its primary weakness is the lack of a patient-centric access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization form designed for all disclosure purposes, and the non-fillable PDF format forces a print-and-handwrite workflow. The form is adequate for its purpose but falls short of best practice in digital accessibility and patient-centeredness. Grade: **B** (3.50).

# JPS Health Network — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

JPS Health Network (John Peter Smith Hospital) is a government-owned community hospital in Fort Worth, TX. The organization's Patient Records page offers three downloadable forms: a primary ROI authorization form (English, with a Spanish version also available), an HIE opt-in authorization, and an HIE revocation form. Only the ROI form (form-1) is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records.

## Forms & Pathways

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is a single-page **Authorization & Request for Release of Information** PDF (form-1.pdf), last revised October 2018. This is a generic ROI form — it does not differentiate between patient self-access requests under HIPAA § 164.524 and third-party release authorizations. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no patient portal pathway mentioned on the records page.

The two HIE-related forms (form-2 and form-3) are irrelevant to patient self-access — they govern provider-to-provider data sharing via a health information exchange.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The Patient Records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records), and web searches also surface the direct PDF URL. The page uses accordion sections to organize content, with the ROI form under "JPS Authorization Form." Fee information and submission instructions are disclosed on the page before download — a transparency positive.

## Form Document Quality

The ROI form is the weakest element of JPS's patient access process. It is an **image-only scan** — a photograph of a paper form with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no extractable text (literally 1 character of output from text extraction). At 478 KB for a single page, it is technically a picture, not a document. It cannot be completed digitally, is invisible to screen readers, and fails basic digital accessibility standards.

The irony is sharp: JPS's 2025 HIE forms demonstrate the organization can produce modern, fillable, text-searchable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The core ROI form — the one patients actually need — remains a 2018 scan that has not been updated in over seven years.

The form is one page, which is an appropriate length. However, because it is an image-only scan, detailed analysis of layout, language clarity, field count, and instructions is limited to visual inspection rather than text analysis.

## Access Pathway Assessment

JPS does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The single ROI form appears to serve all release purposes. The fee schedule on the web page does not distinguish between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees (which Texas state law governs at higher rates). This conflation is a significant patient-centeredness gap.

Submission is limited to **print, handwrite, and mail or fax**. The Patient Records page explicitly states: "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time." Fax is available (which counts as an adequate electronic pathway and avoids the worst penalties), but the form itself cannot be filled digitally — it must be printed and handwritten.

## Barriers

- **Potentially excessive fees**: $30 for the first 10 pages, per-page charges thereafter, and a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery. The $75 electronic delivery fee likely exceeds HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based" standard for patient access requests. The fee schedule does not distinguish patient access from third-party requests.
- **No electronic form submission**: Despite having the technical capability (demonstrated by HIE forms accepting encrypted email), JPS refuses electronic submission of the ROI form.
- **Government photo ID required at pickup**: Standard practice but limits delivery to in-person collection.
- **Stale form**: Over 7 years old, predating HHS Right of Access enforcement actions and 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish language version** available for the ROI form, appropriate for Fort Worth demographics.
- **Fee disclosure** is transparent — patients know costs before downloading the form.
- **Easy findability** — the form is prominent and well-organized on the website.
- **HIE forms show capability** — the 2025 HIE forms prove JPS can do better, which makes the outdated ROI form a choice rather than a limitation.

## Overall Assessment

JPS Health Network presents a frustrating contradiction. The organization clearly has the technical capability and institutional will to produce modern, accessible digital forms — the 2025 HIE forms are well-designed, fillable, and accept encrypted email submission. Yet the core ROI form that patients actually need to request their own records remains a seven-year-old image scan with no digital functionality. Combined with potentially excessive fees and no electronic submission, the patient experience is well below what this organization could deliver. The form is easy to find, and fax submission is available, but the document itself is a relic that creates unnecessary barriers for patients exercising their access rights.

# Nevada Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Nevada Health Centers (NHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Carson City, NV. The organization publishes three ROI-related forms on a well-organized patient forms page. All three are bilingual English/Spanish PDFs created in Adobe Illustrator, and none have fillable fields or an extractable text layer. The primary form for patient self-access is a general-purpose "Release of Medical Information" authorization — there is no dedicated patient access request form.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved from the forms page at `nevadahealthcenters.org/forms/`:

1. **Form-1** — "Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). This is the primary general-purpose release form, covering both patient-initiated requests and third-party releases via a "To/From" checkbox. It is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.
2. **Form-2** — "Authorization to Share Information" (2 pages, bilingual EN/ES). This is a proxy access designation form allowing patients to authorize family or friends to access information on their behalf. It does *not* serve patient self-access.
3. **Form-3** — "WIC Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). A WIC program-specific variant of Form-1, listing seven WIC clinic locations. Structurally identical to Form-1 with added clinic details.

The organization directs completed forms to its Support Services Department in Las Vegas. Fax numbers appear on the forms (and specifically on Form-3's clinic listings), and a mailing address is provided on Form-1. No online portal, email submission, or patient portal-based records request was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NHC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Form-1 uses a single "To or From" directional checkbox to handle both scenarios. A patient requesting their own records would check "To" (themselves) and provide their own contact information in the recipient fields — but the form's language and structure are oriented toward third-party release, asking for a recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524, the Right of Access, or any patient rights language beyond revocation rights. The form requires a "Reason for Request" (with options including "Personal"), which HIPAA does not require for patient self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **relatively easy**. A site-scoped search (`site:nevadahealthcenters.org`) identified the forms page within 2–3 steps. The page is well-organized by category (General Forms, Dental Forms, Mammovan Forms, etc.) with clearly labeled PDF links. However, generic web searches did not surface NHC-specific forms — results returned other Nevada healthcare organizations instead. A patient would need to navigate directly to the NHC website to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a clean, single-page design that packs bilingual content, multiple checkbox sections, and a signature block into a reasonably organized layout. The top-to-bottom flow is logical: patient identification → direction of release → record types → date range → confidential information → reason → signature.

However, significant technical and design issues undermine usability:

- **No fillable fields and no text layer**: All three PDFs were created in Adobe Illustrator with text rendered as vector paths. They have zero extractable text, zero embedded fonts, and zero interactive fields. Screen readers cannot read them, text cannot be copied or searched, and every field must be hand-filled after printing. This is an especially unfortunate choice because the documents are born-digital (not scans) — a word processor or PDF form tool would have preserved accessibility.
- **No "All Records" checkbox**: The form offers six specific record categories plus "Other" but lacks an option to request a complete record. A patient exercising their Right of Access to their full designated record set must check every box and potentially write additional categories.
- **Ambiguous witness line**: The signature block includes a "Witness" field without indicating whether it is required or optional, potentially creating a perceived barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **Inline bilingual compression**: English and Spanish share space on a single page, which keeps things concise but subordinates the Spanish text and reduces whitespace.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers**: No notarization is required. No fees are mentioned (neither disclosed nor explicitly waived). The 120-day default expiration is reasonable but on the shorter side. The witness field ambiguity is a minor concern. The primary barriers are technical: the completely non-digital workflow (print, handwrite, fax/mail) and the inaccessible PDF format.

**Bright spots**: The bilingual English/Spanish design across all three forms is a genuine strength for this FQHC's patient population. The granular confidential information opt-in/opt-out section (AIDS/HIV, behavioral health, alcohol/drug, social services) gives patients meaningful control over sensitive categories. The single-page form length is appropriately concise.

## Overall Assessment

Nevada Health Centers provides a findable, bilingual, concisely designed release form that a patient *can* use to request their own records — but the process was not designed with patient self-access in mind. The generic authorization form, the print-only workflow, and the complete lack of digital accessibility represent a paper-era approach that creates unnecessary friction. The organization earns credit for easy findability and inclusive bilingual design, but loses ground on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness. Overall grade: **C**.

# Blessing Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Blessing Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Quincy, Illinois, part of Blessing Health System. Five documents were retrieved — three superseded English versions (April 2023 and 2015), the current English authorization form (September 2025), and a current Spanish translation. The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf**, the September 2025 English "BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information," which is directly linked from the organization's Medical Records page alongside its Spanish counterpart (form-5.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Blessing Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary pathway is a **generic HIPAA authorization form** used for all releases of information — patient self-access, third-party disclosures, insurance, legal, and care transfers alike. The form uses bidirectional "RELEASE RECORDS FROM" / "RECORDS GOING TO" fields designed for inter-party transfers. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively authorizing the release of records from Blessing to themselves. The purpose options include "Personal reasons," which accommodates patient requests but does not distinguish them legally or procedurally from third-party authorization.

Notably, the retrieval notes indicate that Blessing Health also offers an **online records request tool** with identity verification via driver's license photo, mentioned on the Medical Records webpage. This provides a parallel digital pathway, though the PDF form remains the primary documented route.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Blessing Hospital authorization forms immediately returned direct PDF links, and the Medical Records page at blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords is well-organized under "For Patients > Request Medical Records." The one concern is version sprawl: three outdated English versions (from 2015 and April 2023) remain accessible at their original URLs with no deprecation notices or redirects. A patient arriving via a cached search result could unknowingly download a superseded form — including one that still requires a witness signature the organization has since eliminated.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4.pdf) is a **digitally authored, non-fillable 2-page PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks must be filled by hand after printing; circle instructions ("(Circle) Pick up or Mail or Fax or Email") reveal its print-first design. Despite this, the form is well-structured: patient demographics flow into records source/destination, then record type checkboxes (15 specific categories plus "Other"), sensitive information authorization, purpose, legal disclosures, and signatures. A dedicated page 2 provides **field-by-field completion guidelines** with plain-language examples — a genuine standout feature that most organizations omit.

The language is a mix: legal boilerplate on the authorization side is moderately dense, but the guidelines page compensates with concrete, accessible explanations. One persistent grammatical issue ("I authorize the use or disclosure of the above named individual's health information, its employees and agents, to furnish") creates ambiguity about who is authorizing what.

## Barriers and Compliance

The September 2025 revision made a significant improvement by **removing the witness signature requirement** that was present in the April 2023 versions — a barrier the organization itself recognized as unnecessary. No notarization is required. Photo identification "may be required," using permissive rather than mandatory language. The form does not disclose fees, though the website mentions a $6.50 flat fee for certain requests; HIPAA requires patients to be informed of fees before authorizing. The mandatory date range requirement ("MUST specify date range") could create friction for patients seeking comprehensive records. Submission can be made via mail or **fax** to three listed locations (Blessing Health System, Blessing Health Hannibal, and Denman Services), so patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

Blessing Hospital demonstrates several above-average practices: a **Spanish translation** linked alongside the English form, the detailed **completion guidelines** on page 2, **email as a delivery option**, active form improvement (witness requirement removal), and an **online records request tool** as an alternative pathway. The form is managed through PolicyStat, suggesting systematic version control.

## Overall Assessment

Blessing Hospital earns a **B** grade. The organization provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with helpful instructions and a Spanish translation — above average for a community hospital. However, the generic authorization design means patients requesting their own records must navigate a form not designed for them, and the non-fillable PDF format creates a paper-dependent workflow. The availability of an online records request tool and fax submission partially compensate for the print-and-fill form, but the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway and the absence of fee disclosure on the form itself are notable gaps.

# Synthesis: Aurora Medical Center - Grafton

## Overview

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton is a community hospital in Grafton, Wisconsin, operated by Advocate Health (formerly Advocate Aurora Health). The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones, drawing from Aurora Health Care's centralized medical records infrastructure. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also directs patients to its LiveWell patient portal for online record access.

## Forms and Pathways

Three forms were downloaded:

- **Form-1 and Form-2** are identical copies (same form number S300503 Rev. 11/25, same byte size) of the general "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a third-party release form designed for authorizing disclosure to other providers, insurers, or attorneys. Two URLs exist for the same document, a minor source of confusion.
- **Form-3** is a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" (S88411-EN Rev. 11/25) — explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It features a "Myself" checkbox, omits the purpose-of-release requirement, and opens with a callout to the LiveWell patient portal.

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3**. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, separate from the third-party authorization, is a meaningful structural choice that many organizations fail to make.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Aurora clearly differentiates individual access from third-party release. Form-3 is titled and structured around the patient's own request — no "Release the Requested Information to" recipient block, no purpose-of-release field, and a prominent "Myself" option. The patient portal callout ("Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org") is placed at the very top of the form, proactively directing patients to a faster digital channel before they even begin filling out the paper form. This is a best-practice design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Aurora Health Care maintains a well-organized medical records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records`, reachable in about two clicks from the homepage. The page clearly lists all available forms with download links, including English and Spanish versions, instruction sheets, restriction request forms, accounting of disclosures, and revocation forms. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The forms also appeared in web search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean typography and logical section flow: patient demographics → treatment context → record type selection → recipient → delivery method → signature. The record-type selection is impressively granular, with 22+ checkbox options spanning medical records, imaging by modality, billing documents, and laboratory reports. The language is plain and accessible — the sensitive-information acknowledgment is straightforward without being alarming.

However, despite being digitally produced, form-3 has **zero interactive fillable fields**. All checkboxes are static glyphs, and all blanks require handwriting. This is the form's most significant weakness — adding fillable fields would be trivial for the design team and would dramatically improve the digital experience. The form is designed as a print-and-fill artifact published as a PDF.

## Submission and Delivery

The medical records page lists multiple submission methods: email, fax, mail, and in-person delivery. The form itself offers multiple delivery methods for receiving records: paper by mail, encrypted email, CD, patient portal, and in-person pickup. Offering both encrypted email and patient portal as electronic delivery options is progressive. The note "(Fees may apply)" appears but no fee amounts or schedule are provided — a common ambiguity.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The form correctly omits a purpose-of-release requirement for patient access. Non-discrimination language is present on the third-party form. Minor authorization provisions are detailed and legally careful. The main compliance gap is the vague fee disclosure — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

## Overall Assessment

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton, through its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form, a patient portal alternative, Spanish translations, and granular record-type selection. The retrieval experience is excellent and the content design is clear and well-organized. The primary weakness is the non-fillable PDF format, which forces a paper workflow despite the form being digitally authored. This technical gap prevents the organization from reaching the top tier, but the overall experience is solidly good — a patient requesting their own records has a clear, well-documented pathway with multiple submission and delivery options.

**Grade: B** (weighted score: 4.15/5.0)

# Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital (Richmond, VA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital is part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system and uses system-wide forms for its Richmond-area facilities. Two PDF forms were found: an English-language "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" (form-1.pdf, BSR-MR-50, rev. 1/21) and a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2.pdf, BSR-MR-50SPN, rev. 11/17). Both are single-page, non-fillable PDFs linked directly from the system's medical records page. Beyond the PDF forms, Bon Secours also offers an online request pathway via Ciox/Swellbox and MyChart patient portal access, giving patients three distinct channels to request records.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

The PDF form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for third-party disclosure — the structure asks the patient to authorize a facility "TO DISCLOSE" information to a named recipient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly name themselves as both authorizer and recipient, navigating a form whose conceptual framework doesn't match their use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form.

That said, the form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an "eDelivery by Ciox (for patient's only)" delivery option specifically marked as patient-exclusive. These suggest some awareness of the patient self-access use case, but the form itself was not redesigned around it. The availability of Ciox/Swellbox as an online portal likely represents a more patient-centered pathway, though it was not evaluated in detail as it is a web-based tool rather than a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately surfaced the Bon Secours medical records page at `bonsecours.com/patient-resources/request-medical-records`, where both PDF forms are directly linked alongside information about online and MyChart options. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The URL path (`roi-form-2017.ashx`) is somewhat opaque but the page itself is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (form-1.pdf) is a digitally-authored, single-page PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. The layout is compact and logically ordered: demographics → record types → recipient → delivery format → purpose → legal terms → signature. The top half uses clear, short labels; the bottom half shifts to dense legal language across four numbered paragraphs. Twelve record-type checkboxes plus two "Other" fields provide good scope granularity. Five delivery format options (US Mail, CD/DVD, Radiology Film/CD, MyChart, Ciox eDelivery) are notably generous.

The Spanish version mirrors the English form but lags by over three years (November 2017 vs. January 2021), contains several untranslated English field labels ("Anesthesia Record," "Radiology Film/CD"), and has a minor typographical error (double closing parenthesis). While the existence of a Spanish form is commendable, the version discrepancy raises concerns about whether Spanish-speaking patients receive equivalent information.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees are vaguely stated**: "copying charges will be applied, according to the hospital policy" — with no specific amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) and third-party release fees. This is a compliance concern.
- **No response time stated** on the form.
- **Fax submission is available** (fax number listed in notes: 804-673-9561), so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multilingual availability**: English and Spanish forms linked from the same page — better than most organizations.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Five options including MyChart and Ciox eDelivery with email, going well beyond the typical mail-or-fax binary.
- **Multiple request channels**: PDF form, Ciox/Swellbox online portal, and MyChart portal give patients real choice.
- **Single-page efficiency**: All necessary content on one page reduces patient burden.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference**: The form cites the HIPAA Right of Access provision, which is uncommon and helpful.

## Weaknesses

- **Generic disclosure form, not patient-access form**: The form is conceptually designed for third-party release, forcing patients to adapt.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form lacks any interactive fields — a missed opportunity.
- **Vague fee language**: No fee schedule, no patient-access fee distinction.
- **Spanish version outdated**: Three-year lag behind English version with untranslated fields.

## Overall Assessment

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The form is easy to find, compact, and offers unusually good delivery options including electronic delivery for patients. The multilingual availability and multiple request channels (PDF, Swellbox, MyChart) are genuine strengths. However, the core PDF form remains a generic third-party authorization that doesn't center the patient self-access use case, it lacks fillable fields, and its fee language falls short of HIPAA transparency standards. The overall experience is adequate but not exemplary — a patient can get their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary user.

# Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center provides two distinct PDF forms for health information requests, both accessible from a centralized, facility-specific medical records page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/medical-records-wa/sacred-heart`:

1. **Form 1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" — a general third-party authorization form for disclosing records to an external recipient (insurer, attorney, another provider, etc.). 2 pages, 37 fillable fields.
2. **Form 2** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — a dedicated patient access form for individuals requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). 2 pages, 45 fillable fields.

The facility also offers Spanish versions of both forms, plus additional forms for amendments, accounting of disclosures, restriction/revocation, and Health Information Exchange opt-out — a comprehensive suite rarely seen at individual facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release. The dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" form uses correct HIPAA terminology and is purpose-built for patients requesting their own records. This separation is a significant strength — many organizations force patients through a single generic authorization form regardless of whether they want their own records or are authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was effortless. A single web search returned direct links to the facility-specific medical records page. The page is cleanly organized, with clearly labeled PDF download links and no bot blocking, login walls, or portal gatekeeping. URL naming is descriptive (`wa-sacred-heart-access-designated-record-set.pdf`), and the page is reachable through Providence's main navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form 2 — Primary Patient Access Form)

Form 2 is a natively digital 2-page PDF with 45 interactive fillable fields — checkboxes for record types, delivery formats, and text fields for demographics and date ranges. The form is not an image scan. Page 1 provides instructional text and institutional notices; page 2 contains the input fields. The layout is clean and logically organized.

Five delivery format options are offered: MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, and Fax. The MyChart integration is particularly strong, meeting patients where they likely already have an account. Patients can select specific record types, date ranges, and facilities. A "Last 2 years only" convenience checkbox is a practical touch.

The language is reasonably plain, though it includes some boilerplate legal text. The form includes multilingual language assistance notices (English, Spanish, Chinese) with a toll-free phone number and TTY access. Spanish versions of both forms are separately available.

## Barriers

**Signature**: Both forms require a wet signature ("Print form and sign by hand"), which prevents fully digital completion despite the otherwise comprehensive fillable fields. This is the single most significant barrier.

**Fees**: Form 2 states "Fees may be associated with this request" without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based fee standard. Patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by fax ((509) 474-4815), email (PSHMC.HIMRecords@Providence.org), or mail — multiple remote submission options are available, so in-person delivery is not required.

**No notarization** is required. **No response time** is stated.

## Red Flags and Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The patient access form (form 2) includes a liability release clause typically found on third-party authorization forms, which is inappropriate for a patient exercising their Right of Access. The form also lacks any explicit statement of patient rights (right to receive records, 30-day response timeline, right to appeal denial).

**Bright spots**: The dedicated patient access form, five delivery formats including MyChart, multi-facility awareness ("we would be glad to fax a copy of this form to other facilities"), the centralized portal with Spanish translations, and the proactive SSN disclosure warning on form 1 all demonstrate above-average patient-centeredness.

## Overall Assessment

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center offers one of the better patient access experiences among community hospitals. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, five electronic delivery options, and an exceptionally well-organized web portal demonstrate genuine investment in patient-centered records access. The wet signature requirement and vague fee language are the main drawbacks, preventing a top-tier score. The organization earns a strong B overall — clearly above average, with room for improvement in digital workflow completion and rights transparency.

# Cherokee Health Systems (River Valley Health) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cherokee Health Systems, now rebranded as **River Valley Health**, is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The organization provides a well-organized suite of four PDF documents for medical records requests, available on a dedicated Medical Records page at rvh.org. The suite consists of the primary English ROI authorization form, a Spanish translation, and color-coded instructional guides in both languages — a standout accessibility feature that few organizations match.

## Forms and Pathways

All four documents are variants of a single general-purpose **"Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Health Records"** form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form distinct from the third-party release authorization. The form is bidirectional — it can be used to request records from an external provider or to authorize River Valley Health to send records elsewhere. A "Personal Use" checkbox is included among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Record Requested to be Sent From" and "Record to be Sent To" facility sections) assumes an inter-facility transfer model. A patient wanting a copy of their own records must awkwardly fit themselves into the "Record to be Sent To" facility section.

Submission is available via **email** (registration@rvh.org) or **in person**. No fax number for submission is listed on the forms or in the notes, though the form collects fax numbers for the sending/receiving facilities. The email pathway means patients can submit without a physical visit, which is a meaningful accessibility advantage.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which is also accessible via the main website navigation (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records). All four PDFs are prominently linked with clear labels and descriptive filenames. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot protection blocking direct programmatic downloads — a hosting infrastructure issue, not an intentional barrier. The page includes contextual submission instructions alongside the download links.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — despite being born-digital and recently updated (December 2025), the form was designed for print-and-handwrite completion. A patient must print, fill by hand, scan or photograph, and email the result. This is a meaningful accessibility gap for a 2025-era document.

The layout is logically organized with clear section headers: patient information, sending facility, receiving facility, record type checkboxes, purpose checkboxes, and a signature block. The upper portion is clean and self-explanatory. The lower portion contains two dense legal paragraphs — a sensitive information disclosure notice (appropriately citing 42 C.F.R. Part 2 and HIPAA) and a certification block that packs six signer categories into a single run-on sentence. The certification text is challenging for a typical patient to parse.

The **color-coded instructional guides** (forms 3 and 4) are a genuine bright spot. They overlay plain-language annotations explaining each section ("Enter your personal information in this section," "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider"), effectively translating bureaucratic form headers into understandable instructions. This paired approach — plain form plus annotated guide — is uncommon and genuinely helpful.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no fee disclosure (meaning no upfront fee barrier, though patients are also not informed of costs). The authorization expires after 12 months, and revocation rights are clearly stated.

The form does **not** reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), does not include a patient rights statement, and does not state a response timeframe. These are missed opportunities but not violations.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: The bilingual form suite with instructional companions is exceptional. Providing annotated guides in both English and Spanish demonstrates genuine commitment to patient comprehension and language accessibility — this goes well beyond the typical approach of offering a bare authorization form. The forms are recently updated (December 2025), indicating active maintenance. Email submission availability removes the in-person barrier.

**Weaknesses**: The absence of fillable fields in a born-digital 2025 PDF is a notable gap. The form's generic ROI authorization design does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a bidirectional facility-routing model when they simply want their own records. The Spanish version contains minor translation errors (CRF vs. CFR, missing closing parenthesis).

## Overall Assessment

Cherokee Health Systems earns a **B grade** overall. The organization clearly invested in patient communication — the bilingual instructional guides are a model other organizations should emulate. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the form wasn't designed with that use case front-of-mind.

# Flowers Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Flowers Hospital in Dothan, Alabama, is a 235-bed for-profit community hospital owned by Triad of Alabama LLC and operating within the Community Health Systems (CHS) network. Three documents were retrieved: the hospital's official "Patient Request for Health Information" form (HIM-1406) in both English (form-2.pdf) and Spanish (form-3.pdf), plus an incidental release form from Wiregrass Surgical Associates, an affiliated practice housed at the hospital's Doctor's Center (form-1.pdf). The primary form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, the English HIM-1406.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated and Patient-Centered

Flowers Hospital provides a genuinely patient-centered access pathway. The official form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" — not "Authorization for Release" or "HIPAA Disclosure Form" — framing the interaction around the patient's own right of access. The form's recipient section lists "Myself" as the first option, with "Personal Representative" and "Other Third Party" as secondary choices. This clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release within a single, well-structured document.

Beyond the PDF, the hospital's medical records page offers an online request portal via Swellbox, providing a fully digital submission alternative. Between the fillable PDF (submittable via fax or mail) and the Swellbox portal, patients have multiple electronic submission options — no in-person visit or postal mail is required.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's website has a "Request Medical Records" page accessible from the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation. That page links directly to both the English and Spanish PDF forms and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative searching was needed. This is a model of how a hospital should surface its records request process.

## Form Document Quality

The HIM-1406 form is a single-page, digitally-designed PDF created in Adobe InDesign with 66 fillable AcroForm fields — an impressive level of interactivity for a one-page form. Every text input, checkbox, and selection area is digitally fillable, allowing patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing.

The form follows a logical seven-section flow: patient demographics, facility identification, record type selection (13 checkboxes including "Entire Record"), sensitive information opt-in (5 categories covering substance abuse, HIV, genetics, and psychiatric records), delivery method, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and accessible throughout. Five delivery methods are offered: paper, email (with appropriate risk disclosure), removable media (with password-protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media option with a password-protection toggle is an unusually thoughtful feature.

The Spanish version (HIM-1406S) is a complete, professional translation with identical structure and field count, linked co-equally alongside the English form — not a machine-generated afterthought.

## Barriers and Concerns

No significant barriers exist. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, and no excessive fee schedule. The form does include a witness signature field whose status as required or optional is ambiguous — this could deter patients completing the form at home. The fee disclosure is vague ("There may be charges associated with processing a request"), giving patients no way to estimate costs upfront. While not affirmatively problematic, greater fee transparency would better serve patients.

The form begins with an unexplained "*ROI*" header (internal jargon for "Release of Information") and the fillable fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader accessibility. The footer on the Spanish form remains in English — a minor inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

Flowers Hospital represents a strong example of patient-centered records access. The dedicated patient access form with "Myself" as the primary option, the comprehensive fillable PDF, the co-equal Spanish translation, the Swellbox portal alternative, and the easy findability from the main website all demonstrate genuine attention to the patient experience. The minor issues — ambiguous witness field, vague fee language, accessibility gaps — prevent a perfect score but do not materially impede a patient requesting their own records. This organization earns a grade of **A**.

# Columbus Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbus Community Hospital is an independent nonprofit community hospital in Columbus, Nebraska. A single ROI form was found: a one-page "Authorization to Release Medical Records" (form MR-1, dated December 2014). The hospital does not offer a patient portal-based records request, an online request wizard, or any dedicated patient self-access form. The sole pathway is this generic third-party authorization form, with email submission available via `release@columbusch.com`.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

The most significant finding is that Columbus Community Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form is structured entirely as a release authorization: "I authorize Columbus Community Hospital to release the following information on [patient] to: [Name and Address]." A patient requesting their own records must write their own name and address in the "to:" field — an unintuitive workaround with no guidance that this is a valid or expected use of the form. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that patients have a right to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The hospital operates two domains: `columbusch.com` (the primary patient-facing site) and `columbushosp.org` (a legacy domain hosting the PDF). The patient forms page on the newer site mentions the Release of Information form and provides an email address for submission, but does not include a direct download link. A web search was needed to surface the PDF URL on the legacy domain. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during download.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks are represented as printed underscores requiring handwritten completion. Despite having a text layer (not a scan), the document offers no digital interaction — patients must print, handwrite, and then scan or photograph it to submit via email.

At one page, the form is concise. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, recipient identification, treatment dates, record type checkboxes (nine options plus "Complete Record"), purpose checkboxes (six options), sensitive-information authorization, patient acknowledgments, and signature blocks. However, the single-page density leaves little whitespace, and internal filing codes appear in the footer ("Found in Policy Manager/Consent Forms," "c: HIPAA Manual," page "42") — artifacts of internal document management that were never removed for patient-facing use.

Language is generally understandable but includes unexplained jargon ("H & P") and legalistic constructions in the acknowledgment section. The form includes no instructions or guidance text explaining how to complete it.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form avoids several common barriers: no fees are mentioned, no notarization is required, and no in-person submission is mandated. The revocation rights are clearly stated, and a built-in "Notice of Revocation" section allows patients to revoke authorization without finding a separate form — a genuine bright spot. The non-retaliation statement and 12-month authorization expiration are appropriate.

However, the witness signature line is ambiguous — it is unclear whether a witness is required or optional, which could deter patients completing the form at home. The form's age (dated 2014, over 11 years old at evaluation) raises questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Built-in revocation section; granular record-type selection (nine categories); email submission channel available; concise single-page format.

**Red flags:** No patient self-access pathway; form structured exclusively for third-party release; no mention of patient rights; non-fillable PDF requiring print and handwrite; internal filing codes visible on patient-facing document; disconnected web presence with form hosted on legacy domain without links from the main site.

## Overall Assessment

Columbus Community Hospital provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly patient-centered records request process. The form works — a determined patient can download it, fill it out by hand, and email it in — but the experience reflects a pre-digital, compliance-oriented approach rather than a patient-access-oriented one. The absence of any dedicated patient self-access pathway, combined with a non-fillable form from 2014 and a fragmented web presence, places this organization below average for patient-centeredness. **Grade: C**

# Northwestern Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Northwestern Memorial Hospital, part of the Northwestern Medicine / Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) system, publishes three documents related to medical records requests. The primary form is **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form 8094, rev. 2/2026) — a system-wide ROI authorization covering all 11 NMHC hospitals, physician groups, and behavioral health locations. **Form-3.pdf** is a full Spanish translation of the same form (8094SP, rev. 8/2024). **Form-2.pdf** is a separate inbound records request form for transferring records *into* NMHC from other providers — not relevant for patient self-access.

All forms are published at the system level on nm.org and are used across all NMHC entities. Northwestern Memorial Hospital does not maintain facility-specific forms.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Northwestern Medicine does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to attorneys, insurers, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" as the purpose, then list themselves as the recipient in the "Send Information To" section. This is functional but unintuitive: the form was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) anywhere on the form. This matters because Right of Access requests carry different fee limits and timing requirements than third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was trivially easy. A basic web search returned direct download links to the PDFs hosted on nm.org's media CDN. No website navigation, login, CAPTCHA, or bot-blocking was encountered. The URLs are descriptive and the forms are well-organized in the patients-and-visitors section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **79 fillable fields** — text inputs, checkboxes, and date fields can all be completed digitally without printing. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → facility selection → purpose → record types → delivery method → medical images → recipient → legal disclosures → signatures. Record-type categories include helpful parenthetical explanations (e.g., "Hospital Stay (History and physical, progress notes, consultations, operative reports, discharge summary, test results)") that help patients understand what they're requesting. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The legal disclosure section is moderately dense but covers required elements: 30-day response window, right to revoke, no care denial for refusal to sign, and sensitive-record opt-outs (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic testing, mental health). The language is somewhat complex but not impenetrably legalistic.

## Submission and Delivery

Submission options are strong: mail (Winfield, IL), fax (312.926.3093), and email (releaseofinformation@nm.org). Delivery options are notably forward-looking: **MyNM patient portal**, fax, email, and US mail (CD or paper). The portal delivery option is a standout feature that removes a common access barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or in-person requirements exist. Fees are referenced vaguely — "Standard record copying fees per 735 ILCS 5/8-2006 may apply" — without specific amounts or clarification that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a cost-based amount. This ambiguity could lead patients to expect the (higher) Illinois statutory copying fees even for personal-use requests.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form** with the same 82 fillable fields — Spanish-speaking patients get equal digital functionality
- **MyNM portal delivery** alongside fax, email, and mail
- **Email submission** (still uncommon among healthcare organizations)
- **Memorable toll-free number**: 877.9RECORD with TTY: 711 support
- **Parenthetical record-type explanations** helping patients understand each category

## Notable Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway — generic authorization form for all release types
- No reference to HIPAA Right of Access or patient access rights
- Fee language references Illinois statute without distinguishing patient-access fee limits
- Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version (missing hospital renaming, updated 42 CFR Part 2 language, and TTY reference)

## Overall Assessment

Northwestern Medicine provides a technically strong, easy-to-find form ecosystem with excellent digital features (fillable fields, email submission, portal delivery, Spanish translation). The primary weakness is structural: the organization channels all records requests — including patient self-access — through a generic authorization form designed for third-party release, without acknowledging the distinct rights and fee limits that apply to individual access under HIPAA. The form works well for patients who know what they need, but it wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# CrescentCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CrescentCare is an independent nonprofit FQHC in New Orleans, Louisiana. The organization provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms — one in English (form-1.pdf) and one in Spanish (form-2.pdf) — for patients to request release of their medical information. Both are prominently linked from the Patient Resources and Downloads page. Notably, CrescentCare also maintains a dedicated "Request your medical records" page at `/records-request-form/` with an online submission option, providing a digital-first alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Assessment

CrescentCare uses a single generic HIPAA authorization form for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form is designed with patient self-access as a first-class use case: the "Myself via" option appears first in the recipient section, before the "Or to:" third-party option. This is a meaningful design choice that signals patient access is not an afterthought. The form offers three delivery methods for self-requests — Patient Portal, Encrypted Email, and Pick Up — with two of the three being electronic.

The organization goes further by offering a separate online records request page, giving patients who prefer a fully digital workflow an alternative to printing and mailing a PDF. This dual-pathway approach (PDF form plus online portal) is commendable for an FQHC.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding CrescentCare's forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's Patient Resources page prominently lists both language versions. No bot blocking, browser fallbacks, or creative search strategies were needed. The filenames are descriptive and language-tagged (`_en.pdf`, `_es.pdf`). Retrieval difficulty: Easy.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer. It follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient Information → Recipient → Information to Be Disclosed → Special Authorization for Sensitive Records → Purpose → Expiration → Patient Rights → Signature. The language is plain and accessible throughout; the patient rights section uses clear bullet points rather than dense legalese.

The form provides meaningful granularity with six record-type checkboxes plus an "Other" option, and appropriately gates sensitive records (behavioral health, substance use, HIV/AIDS) behind separate patient initials, consistent with Louisiana law and 42 CFR Part 2.

The primary weakness is that the PDF has zero fillable form fields despite being digitally authored. Patients must print, handwrite, and return the form — a notable gap for a document distributed online. Additionally, the form lacks submission instructions: no mailing address, fax number, or email address appears on the form itself, leaving patients uncertain how to return it.

## Barriers and Compliance

CrescentCare's form imposes no unnecessary barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement. The no-conditioning statement is explicit ("my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on my signing this authorization"). Revocation rights are clearly stated, though requiring a "signed letter" is a slightly higher bar than simply accepting any written request. No fees are mentioned on the form — this neither discourages patients nor sets expectations. No response timeframe is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Providing fully translated English and Spanish forms with identical structure is especially appropriate for New Orleans' diverse patient population.
- **Electronic delivery options**: Offering Patient Portal and Encrypted Email for self-requests is progressive — many organizations only offer mail or pickup.
- **Online records request page**: The dedicated `/records-request-form/` page provides a digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF workflow.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Fitting all necessary authorization elements on one well-organized page respects patient time.
- **Self-access prioritized**: Placing the "Myself via" option before third-party release on the form signals that patient access is a primary use case.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive form fields despite digital authoring — a missed opportunity for a form designed for online distribution.
- **No submission instructions**: The form gives patients no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **No fee or timeline disclosure**: Patients have no expectations about cost or turnaround time.

## Overall Assessment

CrescentCare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an FQHC. The combination of a well-designed bilingual authorization form, explicit patient self-access options, electronic delivery methods, and a separate online records request portal places it ahead of most peers. The main gaps — a non-fillable PDF and missing submission instructions — are common across the industry and prevent an excellent rating. Overall grade: B.

# Lexington Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lexington Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Lexington, Kentucky. Two ROI authorization forms were found on their website: a current 2024 version (form-1) co-branded with VitalChart, a third-party ROI processing vendor, and a legacy 2014 version (form-2) that remains publicly accessible but appears to be superseded. The 2024 form is the actively linked version on the Patient Forms page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

Lexington Clinic does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release" documents designed to serve all disclosure purposes — patient self-access, transfer of care, legal requests, and other third-party releases. However, form-1 includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Purpose of Disclosure," which effectively signals a Right of Access request even though the form never explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 or uses the term "Right of Access."

The organization funnels all records requests through VitalChart, which processes the authorization and fulfills the request. This vendor-mediated model means the patient completes a single generic authorization form and sends it to VitalChart rather than directly to Lexington Clinic's HIM department. No online portal or digital request wizard is available.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A straightforward web search returned direct PDF download links on the first attempt. The Patient Forms page at lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that the legacy 2014 form (form-2) remains publicly indexed and discoverable via search engines, with no version labeling or "superseded" notice — creating a risk that patients might find and use the outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally composed PDF with a clear text layer but **zero fillable fields** — a significant missed opportunity given its digital origin. A patient must print it, fill it by hand, and then submit it via mail, fax, or email to VitalChart. The layout is well-organized with six numbered sections following a logical "who → where → what → why → cost → sign" flow. Section headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are unusually conversational and patient-friendly for a medical-legal form. However, the legal disclosures in Section 6 shift to dense HIPAA boilerplate, and fitting everything onto one page makes the form somewhat dense.

Record-type granularity is good: patients can select specific providers, date ranges, conditions, and record subtypes (labs, radiology, office notes, immunizations, operative reports). Delivery options include mail, email, and fax (fax restricted to healthcare providers only). Email delivery to patients is a meaningful positive — many organizations offer only mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fee structure**: The form cites KRS 422.317, stating the first copy is free, with additional copies at $1.00 per page. While the first-copy-free provision is patient-friendly, the $1.00/page charge for subsequent copies may exceed HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based fee" limit for Right of Access requests. A $5.00 late fee and "non-refundable once services are rendered" language add financial friction not contemplated by HIPAA's access provisions.

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is not a HIPAA requirement for ROI authorization and raises privacy concerns.

**Submission ambiguity**: While VitalChart's mailing address, phone, fax, and email are listed at the bottom, the form never explicitly instructs patients on how to submit the completed authorization. A patient may be unsure whether they can email the completed form.

**No notarization or witness required** — a positive. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- First copy free with clear Kentucky statutory citation
- Email delivery available to patients (not just providers)
- Conversational, patient-friendly section headers
- Good record-type granularity enabling targeted requests
- Single-page, concise format
- Easy online findability

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Clinic provides a reasonably accessible records request process that clears several important bars: the form is easy to find, well-organized, and can be submitted electronically via fax or email to VitalChart. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization form design (no dedicated patient access pathway), and the potentially non-compliant fee structure for patient access requests hold it back from a higher rating. The organization's approach is typical of mid-sized independent practices that outsource ROI processing to a vendor — functional but not patient-centered.

# Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center: Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system, offers patients three distinct pathways to request medical records: **MyChart** (patient portal), **eRequest** (an online wizard powered by Swellbox/Datavant at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html), and a **downloadable paper form**. Fax (513-599-4503), email (MercyROI@datavant.com), and phone (844-835-1238) are also listed as contact channels for Springfield.

Four PDF documents were retrieved, but only two are relevant to Springfield patients. **Form-1** is from mercy.net (a separate Missouri-based Mercy system)—a false positive caused by the confusingly similar branding. **Form-2** is a Youngstown-region variant from the correct system but wrong region. **Form-3** is the system-wide authorization form currently linked on the website, but it is an **image-only scan** with only 46 characters of extractable text—functionally inaccessible to screen readers or digital filling. **Form-4** (MHP 0785 Rev 1/19) is the Springfield-specific authorization form with full text layer, but it is **not linked anywhere on the website**—it was discovered only by guessing the URL pattern (`mercy.com/-/media/.../springfield.ashx`).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. All PDF forms are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information"—generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release. Form-4 accommodates patient self-access via a "Self" checkbox and defaults the purpose to "For Personal use if not otherwise stated," which is patient-friendly. However, the form structure, title, and legal framing are oriented toward third-party authorization. A dedicated patient access request form (like the one from the Missouri mercy.net system, ironically) does not exist within Bon Secours Mercy Health's offerings for Springfield.

The eRequest portal via Swellbox/Datavant represents a potentially more patient-centric pathway, as it is an online records request wizard that may differentiate between request types. However, only the PDF forms were directly evaluated.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page was straightforward—`mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests` is well-organized with clear pathways. However, finding the **right PDF form** for Springfield was surprisingly difficult. The linked system-wide form (form-3) is an image-only scan—a 2024 regression from the 2019 text-based regional versions. The Springfield-specific text version exists at a predictable URL but is entirely undiscoverable through normal website navigation. Additionally, web searches conflated mercy.com (Ohio) with mercy.net (Missouri), producing a false-positive form from the wrong health system.

## Form Document Quality (Form-4, the Best Available PDF)

Form-4 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a full text layer—but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it requires printing and hand-filling. The layout is logical: patient demographics → facility selection → date range → record types (11 checkboxes) → recipient → format → delivery → legal disclosures → signature. The top half is clear and well-organized; the bottom half compresses six dense legal bullet points into small paragraphs with complex language ("Treatment, Operations or Payment disclosures to insurance companies when the law gives the right to the insurers to contest a claim under policy"). The form cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and offers four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email) with electronic format (PDF/CD) as the default—an uncommon patient-friendly choice.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable concerns emerge. First, **"Photo ID required at the time of request"** is stated in the header with no guidance on how this applies to fax or mail submissions, creating ambiguity that could deter remote requests. Second, **"Entire record (standard two years of information, unless otherwise specified)"** imposes a default time limitation that patients may not notice, potentially resulting in incomplete records when HIPAA's Right of Access covers the entire designated record set. Fee language is vague: "There may be a charge for copies of records" with no amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee distinction. No notarization is required, and multiple electronic submission methods are available (fax, email).

## Notable Strengths

The organization offers a genuinely multi-channel approach: MyChart, Swellbox/Datavant eRequest portal, and paper form with fax/email/mail submission. The electronic format default, personal-use default purpose, explicit § 164.524 reference, and MyChart delivery option are all bright spots. The form is available in English only—no multilingual versions were found for Springfield.

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center provides an **adequate but fragmented** patient records request experience. The eRequest portal and MyChart offer digital pathways, but the downloadable form—the fallback option—suffers from critical problems: the linked version is an image-only scan, the better text version is hidden, no forms have fillable fields, and the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access instrument. The result is a C-grade experience where digitally-savvy patients who find the portal do fine, but patients seeking a traditional form encounter unnecessary friction.

# Desert Valley Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Valley Hospital (DVH) is a for-profit community hospital in Victorville, CA, part of the Prime Healthcare system. A patient attempting to request their own medical records online faces significant barriers: DVH's website describes the records request process but provides no downloadable authorization form. The only usable patient-facing form was found on a sister Prime Healthcare hospital's website (Chino Valley Medical Center), using a system-wide template that DVH presumably also uses but has not published.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved during an exhaustive search:

1. **Form-2 (PHSI-280-014 CVMC)** — the most relevant document. A 2-page general HIPAA authorization form from Chino Valley Medical Center, a Prime Healthcare sister hospital. This system-wide template is the standard patient ROI form across Prime Healthcare facilities. It has 47 fillable fields, granular record-type selection, and a clear patient rights section. However, it is branded for CVMC, not DVH.

2. **Form-1 (PHSI-320-012)** — an employee-only authorization for Prime Healthcare's internal health plan. Explicitly marked "FOR PRIME EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ENROLLED DEPENDENTS USE ONLY." Not applicable to general patients.

3. **Form-3** — an employment services authorization from Desert Valley Medical Group for occupational health services (DOT physicals, drug screens). Not an ROI form.

The DVH Medical Records page (dvmc.com/patients-visitors/medical-records/) instructs patients to submit requests via mail, fax, or in person, with a $15 fee and 14-business-day turnaround. No online portal, no downloadable form, and no email submission option are offered.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DVH does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The Prime Healthcare template (form-2) is a generic "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" designed for all release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both the authorizing entity and themselves as recipient — workable but not optimized for self-request. The form does include a "patient request" checkbox under Purpose, which at least acknowledges this use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was rated **Hard**. The dvmc.com website was thoroughly searched — including sitemap crawling and URL pattern probing — with no authorization form found. The Desert Valley Medical Group site yielded only the employment services form. Success required identifying the Prime Healthcare parent system and checking sister hospitals' websites. A typical patient would have no way to discover or download the form online.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2) has notable technical strengths: 47 fillable interactive fields allow on-screen completion, and the document has a full text layer. The 2-page layout follows a logical sequence — demographics, release details, record-type selection, purpose, expiration, patient rights, format options, and signature. The "MY RIGHTS" section uses clear first-person language explaining refusal rights, inspection rights, and revocation procedures. HITECH electronic format options (CD, paper, email) are explicitly cited.

However, weaknesses are present: the form requests a full Social Security Number (unnecessary and a privacy risk), the opening warns that incomplete forms "may invalidate this Authorization" (potentially coercive), a "Witness" line appears without guidance on whether it's required, the header contains a typo ("OR" instead of "OF"), and field names are not accessible (empty in metadata, potentially impacting screen readers). The 1.65 MB file size for a 2-page form reflects poor optimization.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is explicitly required. Fax submission is available (an adequate electronic pathway). The $15 fee is disclosed only on the website, not on the form itself. The SSN collection and completeness-invalidation warning are the most concerning compliance issues — SSN is not required by HIPAA for records requests, and the warning could pressure patients into providing unnecessary information. The witness line creates ambiguity that may deter patients. The "financially responsible party" listed as an authorized signer raises questions about conflating billing and health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 47 interactive fields — significantly better than many flat/print-only forms
- HITECH electronic format citation with email delivery option
- Granular sensitive-information consent (seven categories requiring individual initials)
- Clear patient rights section with California-specific re-disclosure language

## Overall Assessment

Desert Valley Hospital earns a **C grade**. While the underlying Prime Healthcare form template is reasonably well-designed with fillable fields and a clear rights section, the hospital's failure to publish any patient-facing form online creates a fundamental access barrier. A patient must either contact HIM by phone to obtain the form, visit in person, or discover it on a sister hospital's website — none of which constitute an accessible online pathway. The generic authorization design, SSN collection, and coercive completeness language further reduce patient-centeredness.

# Shannon Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Shannon Health, a nonprofit regional health system in San Angelo, TX, provides a single Authorization for Release of Information (ROI) form for all records requests. The form is available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful accommodation for the area's large Hispanic population. While the form is easy to find and includes several patient-friendly features, it follows the common pattern of routing patient self-access requests through a generic third-party release authorization rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Forms & Pathways

Shannon Health offers two downloaded documents, but they are functionally one form in two languages:

- **form-1.pdf** (English): "Authorization for Release of Information," revised 06/2024
- **form-2.pdf** (Spanish): "Autorización para la Divulgación de Información," identical structure

The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-1.pdf (English). The form includes a "Self" checkbox under the recipient field and "Personal Use" among purpose options, acknowledging patient access as a use case. However, the form's structure — with fields for recipient organization, address, phone, fax, and relationship — assumes a third-party release scenario. A patient requesting their own records must navigate these irrelevant fields, with no guidance on how to handle them when "Self" is selected.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal for record requests, and no separate streamlined process for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The website's navigation path — **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** — leads directly to a page with clearly labeled download links for both language versions. This is a 2-click path from the homepage. One minor friction point: web search results initially returned outdated URLs (`medical-record-authorization.pdf`) that produced 404 errors. The filenames were updated for 2025 without redirects, creating link rot. Navigating the website directly resolved this.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores for handwriting; no checkboxes are interactive. For a form dated 2025, this is a significant missed opportunity. Patients must print the PDF, hand-fill all fields, then scan or photograph it for electronic submission.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → substance use disorder options → format → legal terms → signature → return instructions. The flow is intuitive, and the form uses reasonably clear language, though page 2's legal disclosures are denser. The form provides granular control over record scope with approximately 15 record type checkboxes, a date range field, and hospital/clinic selection. The three-option handling of substance use disorder records (include all, exclude all, select specific) is well-designed.

Approximately 25 fields require completion, which is proportionate for a general-purpose ROI form but more than a dedicated patient access form would need.

## Barriers

**Fees**: The form states fees "may" be charged and requires the patient to "agree to pay accordingly" — without disclosing amounts or referencing applicable fee limits. This vague blanket acceptance is the most significant concern; a patient has no idea what they're agreeing to.

**No notarization or witness** required. **No in-person submission** required — email is explicitly listed as the "Preferred Method" via `ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org`. Mail and in-person delivery are also available. No fax submission is listed, but email more than compensates.

**Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) linked side-by-side on the records page — appropriate for San Angelo's demographics (~45% Hispanic)
- **Email as the preferred submission method** — unusually patient-friendly; most orgs default to fax or mail
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: MyChart portal access and encrypted email via ShareFile, in addition to paper, CD, pick-up, and mail
- **Non-conditioning disclosure**: Explicitly states Shannon cannot condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on signing the authorization — an important HIPAA protection many forms omit
- **Substance use disorder records handling**: Three clear options giving patients granular control over sensitive information

## Overall Assessment

Shannon Health delivers an above-average but not exceptional patient experience. The form is easy to find, reasonably well-designed, and submitted through a patient-friendly email channel. The bilingual offering and electronic delivery options are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (funneling patients through a generic third-party authorization), the absence of fillable fields in a 2025-edition form, and the vague fee disclosure prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process wasn't designed with that use case as the primary concern.

# Ben Taub Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ben Taub Hospital is a government-owned community hospital in Houston, TX, part of the **Harris Health System**. It uses system-level forms for medical records requests — both downloaded PDFs are branded Harris Health documents, not Ben Taub–specific materials.

## Forms & Pathways

Two forms were retrieved. **Form-1** ("Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information") is the sole relevant document for a patient seeking their own records. **Form-2** is a marketing/media authorization unrelated to patient record access. Only form-1 is assessed below.

The medical records page at harrishealth.org clearly explains the request process and offers four submission channels: **mail, fax, email, and in-person drop-off**. Contact details — including phone (346-426-0980), fax (346-426-0959), and a dedicated email (Releaseofinformation@harrishealth.org) — are printed directly on the form. A patient can fill the form digitally and submit via fax or email without visiting the facility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Harris Health uses a **single dual-purpose authorization form** for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form handles this well through conditional sections: the "Purpose of Request/Disclosure" and "Expiration" sections are explicitly marked as "only required if the individual providing this authorization form to Harris Health is someone other than the patient." This means patients can skip irrelevant sections without needing a separate form. It is not a dedicated patient access form, but it clearly accommodates patient self-access as a first-class use case.

The email delivery option is labeled "Email Address (Patients Only)," further demonstrating that patient access is specifically considered in the form's design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and it is directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or rendering issues were encountered. The PDF URL is descriptive and identifiable in search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **65 interactive form fields** — a strong digital-first design. However, the fields lack programmatic names, reducing accessibility for screen readers and auto-fill. The form covers patient identification, recipient details, facility selection (with Ben Taub specifically listed), 14+ record type checkboxes, format options (paper, CD, email), sensitive information consent, and signature blocks — all on one page.

The layout is **dense but logically organized**, flowing from patient info → recipient → records scope → format → purpose → expiration → signatures. Section headers are minimal, and the cramped single-page layout sacrifices visual clarity for compactness. Language is moderately clear, leaning toward legal/administrative phrasing, but includes a well-worded non-conditioning statement. The form was recently revised (December 2024), suggesting active document management.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization is required and no fees are mentioned. Multiple submission channels are available. One notable concern: the form includes a **witness signature line** without clarifying whether a witness is truly required or who qualifies. This could be a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.

The form's footer includes an **internal intranet URL** (apps.hchd.local) — inaccessible to patients and a document-control oversight. The fillable fields lack programmatic names, an accessibility deficiency.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery explicitly for patients** — the "Patients Only" label on the email option is a meaningful patient-access accommodation
- **Conditional sections** that let patients skip third-party–only fields
- **Granular record type selection** with 14+ categories and proper psychotherapy notes separation
- **Multiple submission channels** with contact details printed on the form
- **Dedicated authorization withdrawal email** (AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org)

## Overall Assessment

Ben Taub Hospital, through Harris Health System, provides a **competent, accessible records request process**. The form is findable, fillable, and submittable electronically. While it uses a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, it thoughtfully accommodates patient self-access through conditional sections and patient-specific features like email delivery. The witness signature ambiguity and unnamed form fields are the primary weaknesses. Overall, this represents a solid B-level experience — functional and reasonably patient-friendly, with room for improvement in form clarity and dedicated patient access design.

# Consensus Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Consensus Health operates as a decentralized network of independent physician practices in New Jersey. Four documents were retrieved, but none is a dedicated patient records request form. The most relevant document for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf**, a generic, unbranded one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN — not on any Consensus Health website. The remaining three documents are Consensus Health–branded intake paperwork from Skylands Medical Group (a member practice): a general consent/disclosure/authorization form (form-2), a HIPAA acknowledgment (form-3), and a seven-page Notice of Privacy Practices (form-4). None of these serves as a patient-initiated records request mechanism.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Consensus Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The only ROI-adjacent form (form-1) is framed entirely as a third-party disclosure authorization — its language ("authorize the disclosure of information from my health record" to a named "Person/Organization/Facility") assumes records are being sent to someone other than the patient. There is no form, process, or web page designed for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The organization appears to direct patients to the athenahealth patient portal or to contact the office by phone, but no documented ROI workflow exists through either channel.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any relevant form was **extremely difficult**. The main Consensus Health website has no patient forms section. Extensive searching — direct navigation, URL guessing across multiple paths, site-specific searches, and PDF filetype searches — produced nothing. The generic ROI form was only found through a general web search linking to a PatientPop-hosted PDF loosely associated with Consensus Health practices. The Consensus Health–branded documents were discovered on a member practice's WordPress site (Skylands Medical Group), not on any Consensus Health–owned domain. A patient visiting consensushealth.com would find no path to an ROI form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available ROI document, is a bare-bones single-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects approximately 11 fields (patient name, record number, address, DOB, free-text information requested, free-text purpose, recipient name/address/phone, and signature/date). The layout is plain and functional, and the language is reasonably clear. However, the form is critically incomplete: it provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or any indication of where to send the completed form. It carries no organizational branding, so a patient cannot confirm it belongs to their provider. A patient completing this form would have no idea what to do with it.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No submission pathway**: The form provides zero information about how to submit it — a functional barrier that effectively renders the form unusable without outside knowledge.
- **Missing HIPAA-required authorization elements**: The form lacks an expiration date, revocation language, and the name of the disclosing entity — elements required under 45 CFR § 164.508(c) for a valid authorization.
- **"Record Number" field**: The form asks for a medical record number without explaining where the patient would find this.
- **Vague fee language**: The NPP (form-4) mentions "reasonable fees" for copies but provides no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **"Proprietary & Confidential" marking** on the NPP — an odd designation for a document HIPAA requires to be publicly available.

## Notable Strengths

- The **Notice of Privacy Practices** (form-4) is substantive and current (Version 2.0, 2025), including reproductive health care protections reflecting the 2024 HIPAA Final Rule and explicit acknowledgment of patients' right to electronic access.
- The NPP states a **30-day response commitment** for records requests, aligning with HIPAA standards.
- The consent form (form-2) has a well-designed **authorized individuals section** with granular health/payment disclosure options and a detailed **contact preferences** section.

## Overall Assessment

Consensus Health presents a significant challenge for patients seeking their own medical records online. The organization has no centralized patient forms infrastructure, no dedicated records request form, and no documented electronic submission pathway. The only ROI-adjacent form found is an unbranded, non-fillable, third-party authorization template that lacks essential information for a patient to act on it. While the athenahealth patient portal may offer an alternative pathway, this is not documented or promoted as a records request mechanism. The decentralized practice model means patients at different member practices may have different (and equally opaque) experiences. This organization's approach to patient records access is best characterized as an afterthought — not hostile, but functionally absent from its public-facing digital presence.

# Olmsted Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Olmsted Medical Center (OMC) is an independent nonprofit physician practice in Rochester, MN. Two forms were found on the organization's website: a primary "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (form-1) and a companion "Authorization for Allowing Verbal Communication of Protected Health Information" (form-2). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records; form-2 is limited to authorizing verbal discussions with a designated person and explicitly disclaims any written record release.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

OMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. The primary form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, employers, and others. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this generic form: they fill in OMC's address in the "Release Information From" field (pre-populated) and put their own name and address in the "Release Information To" field. The form includes a "Personal" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which at least provides a recognizable option, but there is no guidance text explaining how a patient should complete the form for self-access specifically. The form does not differentiate between individual access rights under § 164.524 and third-party authorization under § 164.508.

That said, the form does reference "CRF 164.524" (a typo for CFR) and includes a strong non-conditioning statement — both patient-protective elements that go beyond what many generic authorization forms include.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. OMC hosts a dedicated "Manage Your Health Information" page accessible through clear website navigation (Patients & Visitors > Your Care & Visit > Manage Your Health Information). Multiple search strategies — filetype:pdf queries, site-scoped searches, and direct navigation — all led to the form quickly. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot blocking, which prevented programmatic downloads via curl but would not affect a patient using a browser. The page also lists Spanish and Somali translations, MyChart proxy access forms, and the verbal communication authorization form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **62 interactive form fields** — a truly digital-first design, not a scan or print-only document. The layout uses a clean left-column label / right-column field structure with clearly delineated sections: patient demographics, release from/to, method of disclosure, date range, record type selection (a granular checkbox grid), reason for release, authorization/expiration, revocation rights, and signature. The language is mostly plain and functional, though the opening line — "This is a legal document" — may intimidate some patients. The authorization section includes standard but dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation.

Delivery options include mail, pick up, fax (marked "Urgent Only — limitations may apply"), and patient portal (also with "limitations may apply"). The inclusion of patient portal delivery is a positive signal, though the unexplained "limitations" qualifiers create uncertainty. Submission methods include any OMC location, postal mail, or fax (507.287.2777), with a phone number for questions. Fax availability means a patient can submit without visiting in person or relying on postal mail.

## Barriers and Compliance

OMC imposes no unusual barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no upfront fee disclosure. The one-year default authorization expiration is standard. Revocation rights are clearly stated and require written notice to the Health Information Department. The form explicitly references the patient's right to inspect or receive copies under CFR 164.524 and states that OMC will not condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility on signing the authorization — a strong compliance posture.

Minor issues include two typos ("CRF" for "CFR" and "provide" for "provided"), an inconsistent mailing address between form-1 and form-2, and the unexplained "limitations may apply" qualifiers on fax and portal delivery. The "File Only — No Records Needed at this time" option in the delivery section is an internal administrative option that may confuse patients.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in English, Spanish, and Somali — the Somali translation is notably community-responsive for Rochester, MN
- **62 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive digital form, uncommon in healthcare ROI
- **Patient portal delivery option** alongside traditional methods
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference** and non-conditioning statement — unusually transparent about patient rights
- **Clean single-page design** that fits comprehensive content without feeling cramped

## Overall Assessment

Olmsted Medical Center delivers a technically strong, well-organized, and accessible ROI form that is easy to find and free of significant barriers. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must use a generic third-party authorization form and figure out how to adapt it for their own purposes. Despite this, the form's quality, fillability, multilingual support, and compliance posture make it a solid option for patients. The organization earns a **B** grade: strong document quality and accessibility, held back by the generic-form-for-all-purposes approach to patient access.
