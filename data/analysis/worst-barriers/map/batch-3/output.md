# Batch 3: Worst Barriers Deep Dive

## 1. Form Impossible to Find Online

**Desert Valley Hospital** (Victorville, CA — for-profit, Prime Healthcare system): The hospital's website describes the records request process but publishes no downloadable form. The only usable authorization form was found on a sister hospital's website (Chino Valley Medical Center). A typical patient visiting dvmc.com would hit a dead end. This is the most severe findability failure in the batch — a fundamental access barrier at a major for-profit hospital that appears to be institutional neglect rather than an oversight.

**University of Mississippi Medical Center** (Jackson, MS — government teaching hospital): The English PDF link on UMMC's own website returns a 404 error. The English form was only recoverable from a third-party caching site (pdf4pro.com). A patient clicking the official "Release Form" link today reaches a broken page. For a major academic medical center, this is a critical lapse in basic web maintenance.

## 2. Witness Signature Requirements

Several organizations require witness signatures — a barrier with no HIPAA basis that particularly burdens patients completing forms at home alone.

**Abbeville Area Medical Center** (SC — independent nonprofit CAH) demands *two* witness signatures, the most onerous requirement in this batch. **Duly Health and Care** (IL — independent for-profit practice) requires witnesses specifically for non-care requests including "Personal Reasons," directly targeting patient self-access. **Springhill Medical Center** (AL — independent for-profit) and **Community Health Center of Central Missouri** (FQHC) also impose witness requirements. This pattern spans facility types and regions, suggesting a widespread misunderstanding of HIPAA requirements rather than deliberate obstruction.

## 3. Social Security Number Collection

**Lane County Hospital** (KS), **UMMC**, **Adena Regional Medical Center** (OH), **Decatur County Hospital** (IA), **Desert Valley Hospital**, and **Springhill Medical Center** all request full or partial SSNs on forms routinely transmitted by fax or mail. This creates identity theft risk with no legal justification — HIPAA does not require SSN for records requests. The pattern is especially concerning at small rural facilities where forms may be handled by fewer staff with less security infrastructure.

## 4. No Submission Instructions on the Form

**GI Alliance** (TX — major for-profit practice network) provides a form with blank provider identity fields and no submission address, fax number, or email. A patient completing the form literally cannot determine where to send it. **Abbeville Area Medical Center** and **El Centro de Corazón** (TX — FQHC) similarly omit all submission details. This forces patients to make additional phone calls — an unnecessary barrier that disproportionately affects patients with limited time or phone access.

## 5. Physician Gatekeeping of Patient Access

**Mercy General Hospital** (Sacramento, CA — Dignity Health/CommonSpirit) requires physician approval before releasing HIV test results and caregiver approval for psychiatric records *to the patient themselves*. The hospital form includes a physician notification/veto mechanism in the standard patient access workflow. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, providers may deny access only in narrow, reviewable circumstances — building physician approval into the default workflow likely exceeds these limits and creates an illegitimate barrier.

## 6. Opaque Portal-Only Access

**Minnie Hamilton Health System** (WV — independent nonprofit CAH) publishes no downloadable form at all, routing patients exclusively to ChartRequest, a third-party portal requiring account creation before patients can even see the authorization terms. For a rural critical access hospital serving a population with potentially limited internet access, this digital-only approach with no paper fallback is particularly problematic.

## 7. Misleading Legal Language

**Boulder Medical Center** (CO) states that "Due to HIPAA regulations regarding security of electronic transmissions, we cannot email records to anyone but your personal email" — mischaracterizing HIPAA, which explicitly allows patients to direct records to third parties. **Desert Valley Hospital's** form warns that "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this Authorization," potentially pressuring patients into providing unnecessary data like SSN.

## Summary of Patterns

Three systemic patterns dominate this batch:

**Indifference, not malice**: Most barriers stem from organizations repurposing generic third-party authorization forms without adapting them for patient self-access. Witness requirements, SSN fields, and "authorize release to" framing are inherited from a disclosure-to-others paradigm that was never redesigned for individual access rights. This is institutional inertia across all facility types.

**Small facilities, bigger gaps**: Critical access hospitals (Lane County, Tioga, Abbeville, Cordova, Nemaha Valley) consistently show the most dated forms — image-only scans, decade-old revisions, zero fillable fields. These facilities lack the health IT resources to modernize, but serve populations that may face the greatest barriers to in-person alternatives.

**Findability failures correlate with system fragmentation**: The worst findability problems (Desert Valley, UMMC) occur where organizational transitions or multi-facility systems create confusion about which website hosts the current form. Broken links persist because no single person owns the patient-facing web content.
