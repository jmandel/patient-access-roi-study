# Guthrie Corning Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Guthrie Corning Hospital is a community hospital in Corning, NY, operating within the Guthrie Clinic regional health system. All medical records forms are published at the system level by Guthrie Clinic and apply uniformly across its facilities (Corning, Troy, Cortland, Robert Packer, and Towanda Campus). Three documents were found: a general-purpose ROI authorization form (form-1), a family/friends access authorization (form-2), and a companion instruction sheet with fees and contact information (form-3).

## Best Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1**, the "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form — it serves all release purposes (provider-to-provider, legal, insurance, personal use) rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient must select "Personal Use" from a list of purpose options alongside "Legal," "Insurance," and "Lay Caregiver." The form does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508. Form-2 (family access) is irrelevant for patient self-access. Form-3 (instructions) supplements form-1 with submission details and fees.

The instruction sheet mentions that "Continuation of care requests may also be completed thru your individual eGuthrie/MyChart account," hinting at a patient portal pathway, but no detail is provided and this does not appear to cover general patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were **easy to find**. A basic web search immediately returned the PDF, and the Guthrie website's medical records page (guthrie.org/medical-records) serves as a well-organized hub. No bot blocking, JavaScript barriers, or login was required. All three documents were directly downloadable.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF**. It has zero interactive fields — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. Despite being digitally authored (not a scan), it was designed as a print-and-fill document with blank lines and empty checkbox squares rather than interactive elements. The form uses 9 fonts and has a dense layout that packs patient demographics, facility selection, record type checkboxes, format options, recipient information, purpose, rights statements, sensitive information opt-outs, and signature into one page. This compression keeps the form brief but makes it visually crowded.

The form's organization is logical: numbered sections flow from facility selection through record types, format, recipient, purpose, rights, expiration, and sensitive information. Language is moderately legalistic — phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" use distancing third-person framing. The instruction to "Read Entire Document Before Signing" is helpful but insufficient as the only guidance on the form itself.

Notable content features include three format options (Paper Copy, Electronic CD/DVD, Electronic On-Line) and granular record type selection (discharge summary, H&P, operative report, radiology by modality, etc.), giving patients meaningful control.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees** are transparent: the companion instruction sheet states a $6.50 flat rate for personal-use electronic records (HIPAA-compliant) and explicitly notes no charge for provider-to-provider transfers. This fee transparency, while not on the form itself, is better than most organizations.

**Submission** is available by mail, fax, or in-person — fax provides an adequate electronic submission channel. No online or email submission is available.

**No notarization** is required. The form does request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary and may deter privacy-conscious patients. The sensitive information default is opt-out (drug/alcohol, HIV, mental health records are released unless the patient checks boxes to exclude them), which is less protective than an opt-in approach. Genetic information is mentioned with no opt-out at all.

Corning Hospital patients face a geographic nuance: the instruction sheet notes "No onsite support" for Corning, directing patients to contact Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA, and mail forms to that address. This could be disorienting for local patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Excellent findability with a well-organized central medical records page
- Single-page form keeps burden low
- Clear fee transparency with HIPAA-compliant pricing
- Granular record type and format selection including electronic options
- System-wide forms eliminate confusion across facilities

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable/interactive fields despite being a digitally-created PDF
- Generic authorization form with no dedicated patient access pathway
- No reference to patient's right of access under HIPAA
- Sensitive information defaults to release (opt-out rather than opt-in)
- Critical information (fees, submission addresses, fax numbers) split across a separate document
- No onsite medical records support at Corning Hospital itself

## Overall Assessment

Guthrie Corning Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find, the fee structure is transparent and compliant, and the single-page format keeps patient burden manageable. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization approach that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, and the reliance on a print-handwrite-fax workflow place it squarely in the middle tier of organizations studied. The process works, but it was not designed with the patient as the primary user.

# Fisher-Titus Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fisher-Titus Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Norwalk, Ohio. Three documents were downloaded from the organization's website: two versions of the same "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form (form-1.pdf revised 11/2024 and form-3.pdf revised 07/2025, both carrying form number FTC24-5) and an unrelated Emergency Medical Authorization form (form-2.pdf) for minor children. The relevant documents for patient self-access are the two ROI authorization forms, with form-3.pdf being the more current revision.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient Self-Access Accommodation

Fisher-Titus does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. Instead, it provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form that serves all release-of-information purposes — patient self-access, third-party releases to attorneys, insurers, and other providers alike. However, the form includes a notable accommodation: a **"Self (same info as above)" checkbox** in the recipient section (Section 2), which explicitly lets patients indicate they are requesting their own records without having to fill out a separate recipient name and address. A "Personal" purpose option in Section 4 further supports this use case.

Despite these accommodations, the form's framing — titled "Authorization to Disclose PHI" — and its overall design orient around third-party disclosure. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access, no plain-language explanation of patient rights, and no guidance distinguishing the patient self-access process from a third-party release. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different primary audience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. It is reachable within two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Guests → Patient Forms) and is also available on a dedicated Medical Records page (/medical-records). No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-rendered links were encountered. URLs are descriptively named. The two independent navigation paths to the form are above average for a community hospital. One confusing element: the Patient Forms page links to the older revision (form-1.pdf) while the Medical Records page links to the newer revision (form-3.pdf), with no indication to the patient which version is current.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-3.pdf, revised 07/2025) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with extractable text. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as typographic underscores, and checkboxes are non-interactive Unicode characters. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand or use a PDF annotation tool. This is a print-first design distributed digitally.

The form's structure is well-organized with **eight clearly numbered sections** following a logical progression: patient info → recipient → treatment location → purpose → record types → format/delivery → sensitive information consent → expiration/signature. Section 5 provides impressively granular record selection with approximately 17 specific record type checkboxes (discharge summaries, H&P, operative reports, lab, pathology, radiology images, immunizations, ED records, etc.), each with date fields. Patients can request their entire record or specific items.

The language is **moderately clear** — section headers are descriptive and the flow is intuitive, but legal boilerplate in Sections 7 and 8 uses complex sentence structures typical of authorization forms. A patient of average literacy could complete the form, though the dense Section 5 and legal consent language may slow them down. Approximately 20–25 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN requested**: Section 1 asks for "SS#" (Social Security Number), which is unnecessary for patient access under HIPAA and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Witness Signature" line appears at the bottom with no explanation of when or whether a witness is required, potentially deterring patients who lack a convenient witness.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: The form states Fisher-Titus "may charge a fee" but provides no fee schedule, amounts, or indication of whether patient self-access requests are free.
- **Two conflicting versions online**: The older and newer revisions differ in content (sensitive information categories, specialty office listings) but share the same form number, risking patient confusion.

## Bright Spots

- **Encrypted email as a delivery format**: Fisher-Titus offers encrypted email alongside CD, flash drive, and paper for records delivery — a progressive option for a community hospital.
- **Granular record selection**: The 17+ record type checkboxes with date fields give patients fine-grained control over their request scope.
- **"Self" checkbox**: The explicit self-request accommodation, while not a dedicated patient form, reduces friction compared to forms that only contemplate third-party recipients.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Fax numbers are listed for each treatment location, and mail and in-person options are available — ensuring patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fisher-Titus Medical Center provides an accessible, reasonably well-designed records request process hampered by a print-only form design and a generic authorization framework that does not truly center patient self-access. The form is easy to find, logically organized, and offers progressive delivery options including encrypted email. However, the lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of patient rights language or fee transparency pull the overall experience down. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience with that patient in mind as the primary audience.

# St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Phoenix, AZ, offers a notably differentiated approach to medical records access. The organization maintains separate forms for patient self-access (form-2.pdf) and third-party release (form-3.pdf), with its medical records webpage clearly distinguishing between the two pathways. This separation is a meaningful patient-centeredness achievement that many organizations fail to provide.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" (X-MR-4869, dated 02/22) — a 5-page dedicated patient access form linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" option. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
- **form-3.pdf**: A 2-page third-party authorization form (X-MR-4862, dated 03/13) — an image-only scan used for releasing records to physicians or other parties.
- **form-1.pdf**: A general Arizona Dignity Health authorization form found via web search but not linked from the St. Joseph's page. It references Mercy Gilbert Medical Center and appears to be from a different facility.

The medical records page also references an online Patient Center/Patient Portal as an alternative access channel (Section D of form-2).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating approximately 4–5 clicks through the Dignity Health website (Home → Arizona → St. Joseph's → Patients and Visitors → For Patients → Medical Records). The path is logical and well-structured, though it requires traversing the multi-facility health system hierarchy. The medical records page clearly separates patient self-request from third-party authorization — a helpful distinction that reduces confusion at the point of access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

St. Joseph's stands out for maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** that is clearly distinct from its third-party release authorization. Form-2 is explicitly titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and covers only patient self-access, while form-3 handles third-party disclosures. This organizational separation reflects genuine awareness of the difference between HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) and authorization for disclosure (§ 164.508).

However, the execution has some issues. The form's processing language states the hospital will "contact you with either denial or acceptance of the request" — framing patient access as discretionary rather than as a right that must be fulfilled within 30 days. Additionally, the employee verification block on page 4 (fields for "ID Presented" and staff verification) implies in-person presentation may be expected, even though email and fax submission are explicitly offered.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is digitally typeset with a clean text layer but contains **zero fillable form fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The form is organized into five lettered sections (A through E) with a logical progression: access type → delivery format → record types → patient portal → directing records to others. This structure is clear and well-conceived.

The form offers unusually comprehensive delivery options: USB drive, CD, secure email, unsecured email, and paper. Submission can be done via email (DignityHealth-AZ-ROI@DignityHealth.org) or fax (two numbers provided), eliminating the need for physical visits. Record type granularity is excellent, with 14+ specific categories plus a "Complete Health Record" option.

The main content design weaknesses are the routing complexity on page 1 — six different email addresses and three fax numbers for different departments, requiring patients to determine which contact handles their request — and the multi-state sensitive records sections (Arizona, California, and Nevada), which add confusion for patients at an Arizona facility. At 5 pages (4 patient-facing plus a facility-only denial page), the form is moderately long but justified by the breadth of options.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. Submission is available via email and fax, so no in-person visit is necessary. Fees are mentioned ("Fees may apply. See attached price list") but the referenced price list is not included in the PDF, leaving patients unable to assess costs upfront. No specific response time or turnaround commitment is stated. A Spanish version of the form is available, which is a positive accessibility feature for the Phoenix market.

## Overall Assessment

St. Joseph's earns credit for the structural decision to maintain a dedicated patient access form — a practice that most organizations do not follow. The form offers genuine patient choice in record types and delivery formats. However, the lack of fillable fields, complex routing instructions, discretionary "acceptance" language, and missing fee schedule prevent the experience from reaching its potential. The result is an organization that has the right framework but falls short in execution, landing at a **C grade (3.40)** that reflects adequate but improvable service to patients requesting their own records.

# Canton-Potsdam Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Canton-Potsdam Hospital (CPH) is a community hospital in Potsdam, NY, operated as part of St. Lawrence Health System (SLH), which was acquired by Rochester Regional Health (RRH). Three documents were retrieved — all from the Wayback Machine, as no forms remain on any live website. The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, a blank New York State OCA Official Form No. 960 ("Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA"). The other two documents are a COVID-specific pre-filled version of the same form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Canton-Potsdam Hospital does **not** offer a differentiated pathway for patient self-access. The only authorization form the organization ever published online was the generic NY State OCA-960, which is designed for third-party release of information — not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. A patient requesting their own records would use the same form as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer, needing to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission tool.

Critically, the parent system's Swellbox/Datavant online records request tool **explicitly excludes** St. Lawrence Health facilities, stating: "St. Lawrence Health is not currently available through this application, for information on requesting these records call (315) 769-4386." This leaves phone as the only visible pathway for patients today.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any form for this organization was extremely difficult. The original SLH website (stlawrencehealthsystem.org) now redirects to rochesterregional.org, where CPH-specific content has not been migrated. Multiple web searches returned no downloadable forms. The only successful strategy was the Wayback Machine CDX API, which identified archived PDFs from the defunct SLH domain. A typical patient would have no realistic way to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2.pdf, blank OCA-960) is a digitally produced PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. Its text layer is severely garbled due to font encoding issues, rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers, search, or copy-paste. Despite being created digitally (via PScript5.dll/Acrobat Distiller), no interactive fields were added, requiring patients to print and handwrite responses.

The form is 2 pages: page 1 is the authorization itself with 13 numbered items; page 2 provides instructions. The structure is logical and reasonably organized, covering patient identification, record scope, recipients, purpose, expiration, and signature. However, the language is formal and legalistic, and the form is not pre-populated with any CPH or SLH contact information — patients must know and fill in the correct provider name and HIM department address themselves.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form includes appropriate compliance elements: explicit voluntariness statement, non-conditioning language, right to revoke in writing, and separate initialing for sensitive categories (HIV, substance abuse, mental health) per NY State law. However, the form header includes a Social Security Number field, which creates unnecessary identity theft risk and is not required by HIPAA. No fees are mentioned on the authorization form itself, though the NPP (form-3) does include HIPAA-compliant fee language limiting electronic copy costs to direct labor.

The form does not specify submission methods, delivery format options, or response timelines. No electronic delivery options are mentioned.

## Notable Strengths

- Uses the standardized NY State OCA-960, ensuring baseline legal compliance
- NPP clearly articulates electronic access rights and EHR-based record availability
- Patient-controlled authorization expiration (by date or event)
- Appropriate sensitive-information opt-in with separate initialing requirements

## Notable Weaknesses

- No ROI form available on any live website; patients must call to initiate requests
- Parent system's online records tool explicitly excludes this facility
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party authorization
- Form has zero fillable fields and a garbled, inaccessible text layer
- SSN field on authorization form creates unnecessary risk
- Organization appears stuck in a transitional state between SLH and RRH infrastructure

## Overall Assessment

Canton-Potsdam Hospital presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in this study. The combination of unfindable forms, a phone-only current pathway, no dedicated patient access process, and technically deficient documents creates substantial barriers for patients seeking their own records. The organizational transition from St. Lawrence Health to Rochester Regional Health has left patients in a gap — excluded from the parent system's digital tools but with no local alternative. A patient today would need to call, navigate an uncertain process, and likely complete a paper form designed for third-party release rather than individual access.

# Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cottage Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Woodsville, NH, affiliated with the Rowe Health Center outpatient clinic. Two documents were retrieved: a standalone one-page "Authorization for Disclosure of Medical Information" (form-1) and a 12-page "RHC New Patient Packet" (form-2) containing a variant authorization form on page 2. Neither document is a dedicated patient access request form; both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was exceptionally difficult. The hospital's website (cottagehospital.org) is protected by Cloudflare Turnstile, which blocked all automated access — curl, browser with DevTools, and even Google's cache were inaccessible. The forms were ultimately recovered only through the Wayback Machine using archived snapshots from July 2024. Notably, the current versions of both documents (updated in 2024) were not captured by the Wayback Machine, meaning only older versions could be evaluated. A dedicated HIM department page exists on the site but could not be verified due to the access barrier. The form was linked from a "Becoming a Rowe Health Center Patient" page — framing the authorization as part of new-patient onboarding rather than a standalone records-request process.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Cottage Hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access form. Both retrieved documents are generic HIPAA authorization forms. Form-1's operative language — "authorize Cottage Hospital to use or disclose my protected health information to [other entity]" — is oriented entirely toward third-party release, with no clear mechanism for a patient to request records for themselves.

Form-2's page-2 authorization makes a meaningful improvement: it distinguishes "Self or Representative" from "Other Provider or Facility" as separate recipient categories, with different scope rules for each. Copies to patients default to "Complete copy of medical record, excluding psychotherapy notes," while third-party copies offer more granular selection. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot, showing intentional thought about different use cases. However, this better version is buried on page 2 of a 12-page new patient packet, which a patient searching for a records release form would have no reason to download based on the filename alone.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form has interactive/fillable fields despite both being digitally created in Microsoft Word. Patients must print and complete them by hand. Form-1 is a single page with approximately 12 fields — a manageable scope. The layout follows a logical flow (identification → recipient → record types → legal disclosures → signature), but lacks section headers or visual separators. Legal disclosures run as a continuous block of dense text with sentences exceeding 50 words. The form uses 5 fonts for a single page, and its footer reads "PAGE 14 OF 28" — a vestige of the larger policy document it was extracted from, which is confusing.

Both forms include confusing remuneration fields ("direct or indirect remuneration in the form of [describe]") that are required by HIPAA only for sale-of-PHI authorizations but will mystify patients making routine requests.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the complete absence of submission instructions on either form. No mailing address (beyond the hospital header), no fax number, no email, no mention of the HIM department as a submission point. A patient who completes the form has no guidance on how to deliver it. The witness signature line, while not explicitly marked as required, may lead patients to believe a witness is needed — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, and no response time is stated.

## Notable Strengths

The non-conditioning statement ("I MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION FORM") is prominently displayed in caps. Psychotherapy notes are properly segregated per 45 CFR § 164.508(b)(3)(ii). The 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure warning for substance abuse records is correctly included. Form-2's welcome letter is genuinely warm and accessible, and its billing section proactively discloses a 44% community health discount for self-pay patients.

## Red Flags

Form-2's General Consent for Treatment (Section 11) contains a blanket authorization allowing Cottage Hospital to disclose records "at its discretion" to any party liable for hospital charges, explicitly including substance abuse, psychiatric, and HIV records. This extremely broad authorization is bundled into routine intake paperwork, raising informed-consent concerns.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Hospital provides a minimally functional records release process that requires significant patient initiative to navigate. The Cloudflare-protected website, non-fillable forms, absence of submission instructions, and generic third-party framing create a cumulative experience that falls short of patient-centered design. The partial self-access accommodation in form-2 and proper HIPAA compliance language prevent the assessment from being worse, but this is a facility where requesting your own records would require calling the hospital for basic instructions.

# CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital is a critical access hospital in Long Prairie, MN, part of the CentraCare regional health system based in St. Cloud. Long Prairie does not maintain its own facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it uses CentraCare's system-wide "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available from a centralized medical records release page at centracare.com. Three documents were found: the main ROI authorization form, a companion instruction sheet, and a separate substance use disorder consent form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

CentraCare does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for all releases of information — to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the "Release Information From" and "Release Information To" fields, placing themselves in the "To" field — an unintuitive workflow for someone who simply wants a copy of their own chart. There is no separate patient access request form, no dedicated section for individual access, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

That said, the form does include a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which normalizes patient self-requests and helps HIM staff route them appropriately. The companion instruction document (form-2) provides clear, section-by-section guidance written in second person, explaining not just *what* to fill in but *why* each field matters — an unusual and helpful touch.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. Web searches converged on CentraCare's centralized patient resources page, which logically organizes the forms. However, a patient searching specifically for "Long Prairie Hospital medical records form" must recognize that Long Prairie uses system-wide CentraCare forms and navigate accordingly. Direct download via automated tools (`curl`) was blocked by bot protection, requiring browser-based retrieval — a concern for assistive technologies and non-standard browsers.

## Form Document Quality

The main authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, despite its digital origins, it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand, or use third-party PDF annotation tools. This is a significant gap for a regional health system. The form has approximately 15–20 fields across patient demographics, release from/to addresses, record type checkboxes, delivery method, reason for release, and signature/date.

The layout is clean and logically structured: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Information to be Released → Special Disclosure → Preferred Method → Reason → Authorization → Revocation. Page 2 provides a comprehensive directory of all CentraCare HIM offices organized by region with fax numbers, phone, mail addresses, and a shared email. The language is mostly accessible, though the revocation paragraph contains dense legalese that may confuse patients.

## Submission and Delivery

CentraCare offers strong submission and delivery options. Completed forms can be submitted by **email** (CCHROI@CentraCare.com), **fax**, or **mail** — email submission is prominently featured and works for all locations. Records can be delivered via paper, CD, encrypted email, or MyChart portal. This is a genuinely patient-friendly set of options, particularly the encrypted email and MyChart delivery channels.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person submission requirement. No fee information is disclosed on either the form or the instructions, though the instructions reference "who may be responsible for the cost of records" without specifying amounts. No response time commitment is stated. The anti-re-release clause ("I do not authorize re-release of this information to anyone") is embedded as non-optional boilerplate rather than a patient choice. The form-3 SUD consent is an image-only scan with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers — but this is a supplementary document, not the primary pathway.

## Overall Assessment

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital provides a **functional but not patient-centered** records request process. The strong points are the multiple electronic submission channels (especially email), diverse delivery options (MyChart, encrypted email), the "Personal Use" reason checkbox, and the unusually helpful instruction document. The weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable form requiring print-and-handwrite, the absence of fee disclosure, and the lack of any patient rights information. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was designed for third-party release and the patient must adapt to it. Grade: **B**.

# Lexington Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Lexington Medical Center (West Columbia, SC) publishes three documents on its Medical Records page at lexhealth.com/medical-records: an English-language "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (form-1), a full Spanish translation of the same form (form-2), and a supplemental Reproductive Health Attestation form (form-3) implementing the 2024 HIPAA privacy rule. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a two-page general-purpose ROI authorization. The website also mentions MyChart as a digital option for records requests, though that portal-based pathway was not directly evaluated.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lexington Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic authorization: "I authorize the following provider/entity _____ to release my health information to: Recipient/Provider Name: _____." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly designate themselves as both the authorizer and the recipient — an unintuitive workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no separate patient access form, and no language explaining that patients have a legal right to obtain their own records. The form funnels all requests — whether to insurers, attorneys, family members, or the patient themselves — through the same third-party release authorization framework.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which links directly to all three PDFs. No bot blocking, no JavaScript rendering issues, and no portal login was required. The Medical Records page provides context for both digital (MyChart) and paper-based requests. This is a well-organized web presence for records access information.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a digitally-authored, text-based PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores and all checkboxes are non-interactive symbol characters. Patients must print and complete the form by hand. The layout is well-organized into three clear sections: patient identification and routing, medical records release details with a granular record-type checklist (~25 categories), and review/authorization terms with a signature block. At two pages, the length is appropriate. Language is moderately formal — not impenetrable legalese, but not plain language either. The authorization conditions (Section 3) use standard legal register that most adults could follow with careful reading.

Submission is limited on the form itself: the only method stated is postal mail ("Mail completed form to: Lexington Health Attn: Medical Records, 2720 Sunset Blvd."). However, Condition 6 states that "a copy or fax of this document is just as valid as the original document," implying fax submission would be accepted, though no fax number is provided for the records department. The website separately references MyChart for digital requests.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness signature** is required — a welcome absence. The form also explicitly accepts copies and faxes as valid. However, there are notable concerns:

- **Full SSN collection**: The form requests the patient's complete Social Security Number as a top-level identifier, which is unnecessary for HIPAA purposes and creates identity theft risk on a document designed to be mailed.
- **Blanket substance abuse/psychiatric disclosure**: Condition 1 states that alcohol abuse, psychiatric, drug abuse, and communicable disease records "will be released" with no opt-out, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records.
- **Undisclosed fees**: Patients are told "there may be a charge" and must call (803) 791-2264 to learn the amount — no upfront fee transparency.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires in 90 days, which is short but generally adequate for a single records request.

## Notable Strengths

The **Spanish-language version** (form-2) is a full professional translation co-located with the English form — not buried in a separate section. It uniquely includes an interpreter services phone number with conference call instructions, a thoughtful accessibility touch. The **granular record-type checklist** gives patients meaningful control over what gets released. The **Reproductive Health Attestation** (form-3) demonstrates proactive compliance with recent HIPAA regulatory changes, ahead of many peer organizations.

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Medical Center makes its forms easy to find and offers a well-organized, bilingual paper-based workflow. However, the process fundamentally treats patient self-access as indistinguishable from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a generic authorization form not designed for their needs. The non-fillable PDF and mail-only submission (on the form itself) create unnecessary friction in an era of digital health records. The SSN collection and blanket substance abuse disclosure represent compliance concerns. The organization earns credit for findability, bilingual access, and clear layout, but falls short on patient-centeredness and technical accessibility.

# Community Health Center of Central Missouri — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Community Health Center of Central Missouri (CHCCMO), an independent nonprofit FQHC with four clinic locations across central Missouri, publishes a single general-purpose ROI form — an "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." Two versions were found: a current 2025 update (form-1) and a superseded 2023 version (form-2). Both are hosted as publicly accessible WordPress uploads on chccmo.org. There is no online portal, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no dedicated patient access form. The PDF form, submitted by fax, mail, email, or in-person pickup, is the only pathway.

## Access Pathway: No Individual Access Differentiation

CHCCMO does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party release. Both versions use a generic FROM/TO routing structure designed for provider-to-provider transfers. The 2025 form asks patients to specify "Please send my records FROM" and "Please send my records TO," with checkboxes for CHCCMO or "Other" at each end. A patient wanting their own records must navigate this structure, filling in their personal information in the TO field — a workflow clearly designed for transfers between entities, not for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). Neither form references HIPAA, the Right of Access, or patient access rights beyond a brief acknowledgment section.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **trivially easy**. A standard web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No site navigation, bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The filename (`Release-of-Records-updated-2025.pdf`) is descriptive. However, the older 2023 version remains publicly accessible at a different URL with no indication it is superseded, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The 2025 form (form-1) is the primary document and represents the organization's current offering. It is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite all entries. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → sender/receiver routing → delivery method → record types → date range → purpose → acknowledgment → signature. However, the page is densely packed, and the multi-column layout in the record type and purpose sections may fragment reading order. The acknowledgment section is a single dense paragraph of legal boilerplate rather than numbered, digestible points.

Positive document features include email as a delivery option (alongside fax, mail, and pickup), preset date range options ("Last 12 months" / "Last 24 months"), and a comprehensive list of 10 named record categories. The form is concise at one page. However, it contains a misspelled heading ("AKNOWLEDGEMENT") and inconsistent ZIP codes between the form body and footer (65101 vs. 65110).

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate. This creates a procedural barrier, particularly for patients completing the form at home. The sensitive records clause bundles all sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing) into a single all-or-nothing authorization without granular opt-in/opt-out, which may conflict with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records. The 2025 form does not mention fees, leaving the cost question ambiguous; the older 2023 version references potential copying costs. No notarization is required. Submission can be done via fax or email, so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: Extremely easy findability; concise one-page form; email as a delivery option (uncommon among ROI forms); preset date range options reduce friction; comprehensive record type selection; non-conditioning and revocation language included.

**Weaknesses**: No dedicated patient access pathway — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization form; no fillable PDF fields despite being digitally created; witness requirement adds unnecessary friction; sensitive records bundling; typos and address inconsistencies in the form; no HIPAA Right of Access language; no response time commitment in the 2025 version (the 2023 version mentions 30 days).

## Overall Assessment

CHCCMO makes its ROI form easy to find and keeps it concise, but the form itself reflects a provider-centric rather than patient-centric design philosophy. It treats all records requests — whether from patients, insurers, attorneys, or other providers — identically through a generic authorization form. The lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, and the absence of any Right of Access language mean that a patient requesting their own records faces unnecessary friction and receives no acknowledgment that this is a right, not a favor. The organization earns credit for easy findability and electronic submission options, but falls short on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and compliance hygiene.

# Labette Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Labette Health is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Parsons, Kansas. It takes a notably digital-first approach to medical records requests: rather than offering a downloadable PDF authorization form, it routes patients to an **online Formstack form** accessible directly from the main website navigation. This places Labette Health ahead of many peers who still rely on print-and-mail PDF workflows.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents were downloaded during the search, but **neither is Labette Health's actual ROI form**:

- **form-1.pdf** — A generic one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" template from PatientPop, hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It does not mention Labette Health anywhere and surfaced only as a misleading search result. It has no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and is missing core HIPAA authorization elements.
- **form-2.pdf** — Labette Health's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), effective November 2021. This is an informational compliance document, not a request mechanism. It does reference the right to inspect and copy records and the right to an electronic copy, but does not link to the actual request form.

The **primary and only pathway** for requesting records is the Formstack online form at `https://labetteheatlh.formstack.com/forms/medical_records_request` (note: the subdomain contains a typo — "labetteheatlh" instead of "labettehealth"). The Contact Us page also mentions visiting the office in person as an alternative.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Labette Health's Formstack form **does differentiate** between patient self-access and third-party release. It includes a "Release direction" field with "to Patient/Self" as an explicit option alongside "Other," and a "Relationship to patient" field that includes "Patient/Self" as the first choice. While it is a single form serving multiple purposes rather than a dedicated patient-only form, the self-access pathway is clearly accommodated — a patient does not need to guess which parts apply to them.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating the website directly; standard web searches returned only the irrelevant PatientPop template. The website blocks simple HTTP fetches (returns 403), necessitating browser-based navigation. However, once on the site, the form is **easy to find**: the main navigation under "Patients & visitors" contains a direct "Medical records request form" link. The Contact Us page also links to it. Overall retrieval difficulty is **moderate** — the form is well-placed on the website but invisible to search engines and requires browser access.

## Form Document Quality

The Formstack form is a strong digital-first implementation:

- **Fully interactive**: All fields are fillable online with no printing required
- **Electronic signature**: Includes a signature pad for digital signing
- **Comprehensive record types**: 15+ specific checkboxes (COVID-19, Abstract, Clinic Note, Discharge Summary, EKG/Stress Test, ER Record, H&P, Lab Results, Operative Report, Radiology CD/Report, Sleep Study, Vaccination History, etc.)
- **Date range**: Includes date(s) of service field
- **Email delivery**: Offers an email delivery option for receiving records
- **Photo ID upload**: Built-in identity verification via file upload
- **Sensitive information**: Explicit exclusion options for mental health, communicable diseases, and drug/alcohol records
- **HIPAA language**: Standard authorization language including 1-year expiration, right to revoke, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warning

The layout is structured with clear sections and the field count (~15-20 fields) is reasonable for a comprehensive records request.

## Barriers and Compliance

No unnecessary barriers were identified. There is no notarization requirement, no witness requirement, and no mandatory in-person submission. The form submits electronically upon completion. The NPP mentions that copies may incur a "reasonable fee" but provides no specific amounts — this is standard HIPAA language but leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **Digital-first, no-paper workflow**: Among the most modern approaches observed for a community hospital of this size
- **Patient self-access clearly supported**: "Patient/Self" is an explicit option, not an afterthought
- **Comprehensive NPP**: Includes an unusually detailed Kansas HIT/HIO section and complete Privacy Officer contact information (name, address, phone, email)
- **Email delivery option**: Patients can request records via email, going beyond the typical CD or paper delivery

## Weaknesses and Concerns

- **URL typo**: The Formstack subdomain "labetteheatlh" (missing an "h") is fragile — if corrected upstream, existing links would break
- **No PDF alternative**: Patients without reliable internet access have no downloadable form option (only in-person office visit)
- **NPP doesn't link to the form**: The NPP tells patients to "complete a specific form" to exercise access rights but never identifies which form or where to find it
- **Website blocks automated access**: 403 errors on HTTP fetches could impact accessibility tools or screen readers that rely on direct URL access

## Overall Assessment

Labette Health provides a genuinely patient-centered, digital-first records request experience that stands out for an independent community hospital. The Formstack form is well-designed, comprehensive, and clearly accommodates patient self-access. The main gaps are the lack of a PDF fallback, the URL typo, and the disconnect between the NPP and the actual request mechanism. Overall, this organization earns a **B grade** — above average in technical accessibility and patient-centeredness, with minor findability and disclosure gaps preventing a top score.

# Wayne County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Monticello, Kentucky. The facility provides a single one-page form for patients requesting their own medical records, along with a parallel web-based HTML form that captures equivalent information online. For a small rural hospital, the availability of dual pathways — PDF and online — is notably progressive.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Only one downloadable PDF was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." This is a patient-access-oriented form, not a generic third-party authorization. The title and structure center on patient self-access, with "self" listed first among record-ownership options (self, child, other). The hospital also offers a web-based HTML form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` that collects equivalent information and allows electronic submission — a genuinely useful alternative to the print-and-deliver workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Wayne County Hospital does a better-than-average job distinguishing patient self-access from third-party release. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" rather than "Authorization for Release of Information," and the patient is addressed directly as the expected user. However, the same single form is used for all requesters — self, child, or other — with no separate instructions or additional authorization requirements for third-party requests. There is no dedicated third-party release form, which means the form functions as a blended instrument, though its default orientation is clearly toward patient access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted web search. The form lives at `/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf` — a media library path that is not linked from any navigable page on the hospital website. The HIM department page provides a phone number but no form download link. There is no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. A patient browsing the website would likely not discover the PDF without calling HIM or using a search engine. The web-based form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` may be more discoverable through site navigation, though this was not confirmed. Retrieval difficulty is moderate — not hard, but requiring search engine assistance rather than intuitive site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable single page. It has a text layer (not a scan) and uses only three fonts, but all fields are represented as underscore blanks — a print-and-handwrite design. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → request type and delivery method → record ownership → dates of service → specific records requested (10 checkboxes) → reason for request → identification presented → signatures. The language is plain and accessible with no legalese. One page is an appropriate length for this type of request.

Delivery options are strong: fax, email, mail, and pick-up. Email as a delivery option is uncommon at critical access hospitals and reduces barriers for rural patients who may live far from the facility.

## Barriers & Compliance Concerns

**Witness requirement:** The form includes a separate "Witness" signature line. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access requests, and this creates a meaningful barrier — a patient filling out the form at home must find a witness before submitting. This is particularly burdensome for rural and isolated patients.

**Reason for request:** The form asks patients to check a reason (Continuity of Care, Personal Interest, Insurance Claims Processing, Legal Claims Processing, Other) without indicating this is optional. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not justify their request.

**Submission method not specified on PDF:** The form itself does not state where or how to return it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is printed on the document. However, the existence of the web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` provides a clear electronic submission pathway.

**Fee transparency:** The form prominently states "Based on KRS 422.317 a first copy of a patient's record will be provided free, subsequent copies may be charged." This Kentucky-law-based disclosure of free first copies is unusually transparent for a facility of this size.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dual pathway (PDF + web form):** Offering both a downloadable PDF and an online web form is exceptional for a 25-bed critical access hospital.
- **Free-copy disclosure on the form itself:** Citing KRS 422.317 about free first copies directly on the form is a bright spot few larger organizations match.
- **Email delivery option:** Including email alongside fax, mail, and pick-up is forward-thinking.
- **One-page brevity:** No unnecessary legal boilerplate — approachable and quick to complete.

## Overall Assessment

Wayne County Hospital demonstrates a patient-centered approach that exceeds expectations for its size and setting. The form is clearly designed for patient self-access, the language is plain, and the availability of an online web form and email delivery are genuine differentiators. The main weaknesses are the witness signature requirement (a real barrier with no legal basis for patient access requests), the unfindability of the PDF on the website, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF. Despite these issues, the overall pathway is solid — a patient can submit their request electronically via the web form, receive records by email, and pay nothing for a first copy.

# SSM Health DePaul Hospital - St. Louis: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health DePaul Hospital in Bridgeton, MO is part of the SSM Health system, a major nonprofit health system operating across the Midwest. The hospital does not maintain its own medical records request forms; instead, it relies on SSM Health's system-wide forms. Two versions were found: an older system-wide form (form-1, "SSMHC" branding, dated 1/2019) and a current St. Louis metro–specific form (form-2, "SSM Health" branding). Form-2 is the applicable document for DePaul Hospital patients. Additionally, SSM Health's medical records page references an electronic request option through the **MRO Express portal** (mroexpress.mrocorp.com) for Missouri facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Both forms are dual-purpose documents titled "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," combining individual access requests and third-party disclosure authorizations into a single instrument. A patient requesting their own records must navigate structure designed for third-party releases — including a "disclose my protected health information to" recipient block with name, address, fax, and relationship fields. The "For personal access" option exists only as a checkbox buried under the "Purpose of Disclosure" section, alongside options like "Insurance/Workers' Compensation" and "Legal."

This dual-purpose design means patients must determine which fields to fill, which to skip, and how to route a form that assumes a releasing-to and releasing-from party. While technically functional, it is not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required moderate effort. The SSM Health medical records page (ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records) uses location-dependent content loading to surface region-specific forms, but the location selector's autocomplete reportedly failed during testing. Starting from DePaul Hospital's location page, the "Get Medical Records" link redirects to the system-wide page without directly linking the St. Louis metro form. A web search for SSM Health medical records forms did surface both PDFs, and the form-2 URL is descriptively structured. Overall, a patient would need 3+ clicks and some navigation persistence.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 — the relevant document — is a **single-page fillable PDF with 69 interactive fields**, representing a genuine digital-first design. Patients can complete the entire form electronically in any PDF viewer without printing. This is a clear strength. The form includes fields for patient demographics, type of access (inspection, hard copy, electronic copy), record type checkboxes with date fields (including sensitive categories like substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV-related information), purpose of disclosure, and a seven-item acknowledgement section covering HIPAA rights.

However, the language is **legalistic** throughout. The acknowledgement section contains seven dense paragraphs written in formal legal register. There are no separate instructions, no plain-language summary, and no guidance helping patients understand which fields apply to their situation. The single-page constraint results in compressed formatting and small text in the acknowledgement section. The form is English-only.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and **no in-person submission mandate**. Fees are disclosed as possible ("I may be required to pay the cost of creating paper copies or electronic media") but without specific amounts and with a TPO exception carve-out. A 30-day response time is committed, and the right to request review of access denials is clearly stated. Revocation rights and non-conditioning of care are explicitly covered.

The most notable concern is the **email delivery warning**: SSM Health states that encrypted email is "the only way to avoid third party interception" and frames unencrypted email delivery as a risky exception requiring patient acknowledgement. While email delivery is technically offered (form-2 includes an email field), the discouraging language may deter patients from choosing electronic delivery. An expiration date field — with research-oriented options — is misplaced for patient access requests and may confuse non-research requestors.

## Notable Strengths

- **69 fillable form fields** on a single page — genuinely fillable, not a flat scan
- **Email delivery option** with explicit email address field (form-2 improvement over form-1)
- **Granular record type selection** with sensitive-category breakouts for substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV
- **MRO Express portal** as an alternative electronic request pathway
- **Clear rights statements** covering 30-day timeline, denial review, and revocation

## Key Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as insurance companies and attorneys
- **Legalistic language** with no plain-language guidance or instructions
- **Email delivery framed as risky exception** rather than standard option
- **English-only** — no multilingual support
- **Expiration date field** inappropriate for patient access requests

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health DePaul Hospital earns a **C grade**. The fillable PDF form and MRO Express portal provide adequate technical infrastructure, and the form covers HIPAA compliance basics without imposing illegitimate barriers. However, the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, combined with dense legal language and no patient-facing guidance, means a patient must work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights. The org meets minimum requirements but falls short of patient-centered design.

# Boulder Medical Center — Organization Synthesis

## Available Pathways

Boulder Medical Center (BMC) presents patients with three record-request pathways, clearly laid out on their [Medical Records department page](https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/departments/medical-records/): (1) a Swellbox online portal for records created before September 9, 2024; (2) the MyChart "Sharing Hub" for records after that date; and (3) a downloadable PDF authorization form. The PDF form (`form-1.pdf`) was the only traditional document available for download and is the focus of this evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

BMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single PDF form — titled "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Patient Information" — is a generic ROI authorization designed to handle bidirectional record transfers between entities. While the phrase "I am requesting my records" appears, the form's structure treats the patient as a routing intermediary rather than the information recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no language explaining patient-specific rights beyond the standard no-conditioning clause. The online portals (Swellbox and MyChart) may provide a more patient-centric experience, but neither was evaluated as a downloadable form document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search led directly to the Medical Records page, where the PDF is clearly linked under "Option 2." No bot-blocking, JavaScript rendering, or deep navigation was required. The page helpfully contextualizes the PDF as one of three options, giving patients a clear choice. This is a strong findability result.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a single-page, digitally-created document — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print and handwrite. The layout follows a logical flow (demographics → delivery method → record types → entity information → authorization → signatures), but the authorization section is a dense block of nine "I understand" statements with no visual separation. The form includes some genuinely helpful plain-language disclosures ("once this information is disclosed by BMC, it will no longer be protected by BMC"), though the dual-direction design ("from the Entity... to be mailed to ___ at BMC" vs. "to be sent to Entity listed below") is confusing for a patient requesting their own records for personal use. Record type options are limited to five categories with no "all records" checkbox.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form states a 10-business-day processing time, well within HIPAA's 30-day window. It correctly includes a no-conditioning clause and a 180-day expiration. However, the fee disclosure is vague ("there may be a cost to copy the records") with no schedule or estimate. Most concerning is the email restriction: "Due to HIPAA regulations regarding security of electronic transmissions, we cannot email records to anyone but your personal email." This mischaracterizes HIPAA, which explicitly grants patients the right to direct records to a third party. The designated agent language is also narrowly scoped, covering only incapacitated patients rather than parents of minors or POA holders. Submission can be done by fax (303-449-9380) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple pathways**: The website clearly presents three options (Swellbox, MyChart, PDF), giving patients choices based on their record dates and preferences.
- **Single-page conciseness**: The form avoids the multi-page burden common at other organizations.
- **Plain-language disclosures**: Several authorization statements are unusually clear and honest.
- **Easy findability**: The form is prominently linked from a well-organized Medical Records page.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** despite being a digitally-created PDF — a missed opportunity.
- **No patient access differentiation**: The form treats all requests identically regardless of who is requesting and why.
- **Misleading HIPAA email restriction**: Incorrectly frames a policy choice as a legal requirement.
- **Stale form**: Revision date January 2019, uploaded November 2020, but a major system transition occurred in September 2024.

## Overall Assessment

Boulder Medical Center earns credit for making its form easy to find and for offering multiple request pathways including online portals. However, the PDF form itself is a generic, non-fillable ROI authorization that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The misleading email restriction and vague fee disclosure are compliance concerns. A patient can complete the process via fax or mail submission without visiting in person, which meets the baseline, but the lack of fillable fields and the form's dual-direction confusion reduce usability. The organization is adequate but not patient-centered in its PDF-based pathway.

# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore is part of the Hillcrest HealthCare System (Ardent Health Services), and all medical records requests are handled through the parent system's centralized infrastructure. Two PDFs were downloaded during research, but only one is relevant: **form-2.pdf** is the system-wide "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (HMC1072, Rev. 08/18), which lists Hillcrest Hospital Claremore among nine facilities via checkboxes. Form-1.pdf belongs to an entirely unrelated practice — Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego, CA — and was a false-positive search result retained per study protocol.

Beyond the paper form, the system's Medical Records Request page advertises two digital pathways: **MyChart** (patient portal) and a **Swellbox** online request wizard (hosted at swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html). The paper form is thus the weakest of three available channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** clearly differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The paper form is a generic HIPAA authorization covering both disclosure *to* and receipt *from* third parties in a single document. It includes "At the request of the patient or patient's representative" as one purpose checkbox among Insurance, Continued treatment, Legal, and Other — framing patient access as merely one use case rather than a distinct right. The form makes no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

However, the availability of the Swellbox online wizard suggests the system may have a more patient-centric digital pathway. The paper form alone is clearly designed for the traditional release-of-information workflow, not individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search led directly to the system-wide Medical Records Request page at hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/, reachable in 2–3 clicks from the main website. The page clearly presents multiple pathways (MyChart, Swellbox, paper form). One minor friction point: direct searches for "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" specifically did not surface the form — a patient must navigate through or discover the parent system's centralized page.

## Form Document Quality

The paper form (form-2.pdf) is a **digitally created PDF with zero fillable fields**, forcing patients to print and handwrite all entries. This is a missed opportunity — the form was created digitally but not made interactive. The document is effectively one page of content duplicated as a carbon-copy format (page 1 for the facility, page 2 for the patient), a vestige of physical paper workflows.

The layout follows a logical flow: facility selection → patient identification → authorization body → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. However, the "I understand" section is a dense block of legalistic text with minimal visual separation. Record type options are clinically specific (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, etc.) with no "all records" or "entire medical record" checkbox. The checkbox characters extract as Khmer script (U+17A2), indicating a font-mapping issue that breaks assistive technology.

The language is **moderately legalistic**, particularly the sensitive-information acknowledgment paragraph, which is a single run-on sentence listing communicable diseases.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release the entities listed above, their agents and employees from any liability" as a condition of authorizing disclosure — not required by HIPAA and a red flag.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Normal applicable fees, such as copy fees, may apply" with no schedule or estimate.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no mailing address, fax number, or other submission method — patients must figure out delivery independently.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Patients cannot authorize general records release while excluding mental health, HIV, or substance abuse information.
- **No notarization** or witness requirement — a positive.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple request pathways**: The system offers MyChart, Swellbox online wizard, and a paper form — patients have choices.
- **System-wide form clarity**: The facility checkbox design clearly identifies which entities are covered, preventing confusion about facility-specific forms.
- **Easy findability**: The centralized Medical Records Request page is well-organized and accessible.

## Overall Assessment

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore benefits from its parent system's multi-channel approach to records requests, with digital options (MyChart and Swellbox) supplementing the paper form. However, the paper form itself — the only downloadable document — is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, legalistic language, and a problematic liability waiver. The organization earns credit for pathway availability and findability, but the form document quality and lack of patient access differentiation hold it back. A patient who only finds the paper form faces a distinctly paper-era experience; a patient who discovers the online pathways has a better route. Overall: **adequate infrastructure, mediocre form document, no patient-access differentiation**.

# Cuba Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cuba Memorial Hospital is a small, independent critical access hospital in Cuba, NY, affiliated with the Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) alongside Olean General Hospital (OGH) and Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC). The hospital does not publish its own medical records request form. Instead, patients must discover and use ROI forms from affiliated UAHS facilities, found on a separate organization's website.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two forms were retrieved, both from the BRMC-OGH website (brmc-ogh.org), not from Cuba Memorial's own site:

- **Form 1 (OGH)**: "Authorization for Patient Access and/or Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," branded for Olean General Hospital. This is the most relevant form since both OGH and Cuba Memorial are New York facilities within UAHS.
- **Form 2 (BRMC)**: Nearly identical form branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Less relevant due to cross-state jurisdiction, but its blank disclosing-organization field makes it theoretically more adaptable.

The hospital's website also mentions a "YourHEALTH" patient portal for electronic record access, but no ROI form or formal request process is linked from the portal page.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are dual-purpose: their title explicitly covers both "Patient Access" and "Use and Disclosure." Section 4 includes dedicated checkboxes for patient inspection or copies, alongside a third-party release authorization line. This is a modest positive — the form acknowledges patient self-access as a use case rather than treating it as an afterthought. However, the form is fundamentally a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all release purposes, not a dedicated patient access form. A Cuba Memorial patient must also contend with the fact that neither form mentions their hospital by name, creating real confusion about which form to use and where to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was moderately difficult. Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website has no medical records page, no patient forms section, and no downloadable ROI form. Multiple search strategies — including site-specific searches, direct navigation, and sitemap review — yielded nothing. The forms were only discovered by following a small footer link from Cuba Memorial's site to the BRMC-OGH website, then navigating to the medical records page. A patient would need to recognize this footer link as relevant, navigate a different organization's site, and infer that the "OGH" form applies to their Cuba Memorial records — a non-obvious multi-step process.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are 2-page, digitally produced PDFs with text layers — not scans. However, neither has fillable fields (fillable_field_count: 0). Patients must print and complete them by hand. The forms use a numbered seven-section structure (authorization statement, disclosing organization, record types, recipient/patient access, patient rights, expiration, specially protected information) that provides reasonable organization. Approximately 15 fields require completion for a patient self-access request.

The language is moderately legalistic but generally comprehensible. Patient rights statements in Section 5 cover voluntariness, no treatment impact, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, and right to copies. However, a typo in Section 5(c) — "but in do" instead of "but if I do" — has persisted across both forms since at least 2017, suggesting the templates are unmaintained.

## Barriers

- **No clear submission pathway**: The forms provide no instructions for how to submit them. The bolded statement "Photo ID is required for records to be picked up" implies in-person pickup as the expected or only delivery method. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or online submission option is mentioned on the form or the BRMC-OGH medical records page.
- **Witness lines**: Dedicated witness signature lines appear without indication of whether witnessing is required or optional, potentially deterring patients from submitting unwitnessed forms.
- **90-day expiration**: Authorization expires after 90 days, which is unnecessary for patient access requests under HIPAA's ongoing right of access.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) mentions "a reasonable copy fee" with no specifics or fee schedule reference.
- **Outdated forms**: Both forms were last revised in January 2017, predating Information Blocking rules and 21st Century Cures Act implementation.

## Strengths

- The form explicitly contemplates patient self-access with dedicated inspection/copies checkboxes — relatively uncommon among generic authorization forms.
- Granular record type selection (11 categories with date ranges) gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.
- Appropriate handling of specially protected information (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) with separate consent checkboxes consistent with New York law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Overall Assessment

Cuba Memorial Hospital presents significant access challenges for patients seeking their own records online. The hospital publishes no form of its own, requiring patients to navigate to an affiliated organization's website and use a form branded for a different hospital. The forms themselves, while structurally adequate and notably inclusive of patient self-access checkboxes, are non-fillable, outdated, and provide no guidance on submission or delivery methods. The implied requirement for in-person pickup with photo ID — potentially at a facility 30+ miles away — represents a meaningful barrier for a rural critical access hospital population. The overall experience falls short of patient-centered design, earning a grade of C.

# Synthesis: Duly Health and Care

## Overview

Duly Health and Care (Downers Grove, IL) is a large independent, for-profit physician practice formerly known as DuPage Medical Group. Four PDF documents were retrieved: one Duly-branded ROI authorization (form-1), two MediCopy vendor authorization forms (forms 2 and 4), and one specialized FMLA/disability intake form (form-3). The primary form for patient self-access is **form-1**, Duly's own "Authorization for Release of Health Information," processed by ScanSTAT Technologies and last updated June 2023.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Duly does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. All four forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any disclosure purpose. Form-1's "Purpose of Disclosure" section includes a "Personal Reasons" checkbox, and forms 2 and 4 offer "Personal Use," but none of these forms are specifically designed around the patient's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. The same witness requirements, fee language, and expiration terms apply regardless of whether the patient is requesting records for themselves or authorizing release to a third party.

The form header does note that records "may be available through MyDMGHealth" (the MyChart patient portal), suggesting a digital self-service alternative exists — but this is a brief aside, not a developed pathway. Delivery methods on form-1 include fax, mail, MyChart, secure e-delivery, and pick-up, which is above-average flexibility. Submission of the completed form can be done via fax (630-873-8797) or email (mrrequests@dupagemd.com), so a patient can submit without visiting the facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Duly's forms was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned direct PDF links on the first attempt. Duly hosts forms on Azure blob storage, and a dedicated medical records request page exists at `dulyhealthandcare.com/services/medical-records-requests`. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor friction: the coexistence of Duly-branded and MediCopy-branded forms could confuse a patient about which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF with a text layer and clean extraction, but **zero fillable fields**. It is a print-and-fill document. Despite being "Updated 062023," the form retains legacy branding — the email uses `@dupagemd.com`, the MyChart URL references `dupagemedicalgroup.com`, and the form ID starts with "DMG." The layout is organized into six clearly numbered sections with a logical flow (patient info → records requested → recipient → delivery → purpose → signature). Record-type checkboxes are granular (11 categories including imaging CDs), and date format examples are provided — helpful details many forms lack. However, the legal text in Section 6 is dense, presented as a continuous block in small type.

The MediCopy forms (2 and 4) use friendlier conversational headings ("Tell us about the patient," "Where are we sending the records?") but also lack fillable fields and have their own issues: form-2 has no submission contact information at all, while form-4 adds a witness requirement.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-1 requires a witness signature unless the request is for continuation/transfer of care or records go directly to the patient. A patient requesting records for "Personal Reasons" must find a witness — an unusual burden with no HIPAA basis. Form-4 imposes the same requirement.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "Charges may apply. Please contact us for details. Cash payments are not accepted." No fee schedule is provided, no amounts are indicated, and there is no acknowledgment that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests. The cash-payment prohibition is unexplained.

**"All records" rejection**: Form-1 explicitly states that "'All records' or incomplete dates are not considered specific." This may improperly limit patient access under HIPAA, which permits patients to request their entire designated record set.

**No notarization** is required — a positive. **Response time** is not stated.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple delivery methods** including MyChart, secure e-delivery, fax, mail, and pick-up — five options on form-1.
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** with 11 categories give patients specific control.
- **Explicit date format examples** reduce ambiguity.
- **Patient rights statements** in form-1's Section 6 cover revocation, right to inspect, right to refuse, and re-disclosure — comprehensive if dense.
- **Easy retrieval** — forms found quickly with no technical barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Duly Health and Care provides a functional but undifferentiated records request process. The primary form is well-organized and offers good delivery flexibility, but it funnels all requests — patient self-access and third-party releases alike — through a single generic authorization with unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, fee opacity, rejection of blanket record requests). The form is not fillable, retains outdated branding, and does not acknowledge the distinction between patient access rights and third-party authorization. A patient can complete the process (print, fill, fax), but the experience is not designed around their needs as a rights-holder under HIPAA.

# Broward Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Broward Health, a government-owned regional health system in Fort Lauderdale, FL, offers a single general-purpose ROI authorization form ("Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Information") in four languages: English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese. The organization also provides an online records request wizard via Swellbox, a third-party vendor. The system operates multiple facilities (Medical Center, North, Coral Springs, Imperial Point, East Imaging Center, Weston), all sharing the same form and process.

## Access Pathway

Broward Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ROI form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both purposes, with a "MYSELF" checkbox alongside an "OTHER" option for third-party recipients. While this checkbox makes it possible for patients to request their own records, the form was not designed around the patient access use case — it requires a purpose statement (not required under HIPAA § 164.524 for patient access), applies minimum necessary language to all requests (which should not apply to individual access under 45 CFR § 164.502(b)(2)(v)), and includes a witness signature line that creates unnecessary procedural friction.

The Swellbox online wizard at `swellbox.com/broward-health-wizard.html` offers a potentially better digital pathway, though the PDF form appears to be the primary resource offered on the Medical Records Request page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The Medical Records Request page is reachable in approximately 3 clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Information Request → Medical Records Request) and is well-organized, listing all four language versions with direct download links plus the Swellbox option. However, **Cloudflare bot protection** blocked all direct `curl` download attempts, requiring browser-based retrieval. The English form URL was also case-sensitive, with the lowercase variant linked on the page failing — a subtle but real broken link.

## Form Document Quality

The form quality is a mixed picture. On the positive side, the form is a concise single page with a logical section flow: sensitive record classification, patient demographics, authorization and recipient designation, delivery method, purpose, date range, detailed record type checklist (~15 categories with date ranges for lab and radiology), patient rights disclosures, and signatures.

On the negative side, the **English version (form-1.pdf) is an image-only scan** — a grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no screen reader accessibility. This is the primary language version yet the worst quality artifact. The Spanish, Creole, and Portuguese versions are digitally created PDFs with text layers, but they too have **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The Spanish and Portuguese versions also have garbled text from font encoding errors in their expiration clauses. The form's footer references "ADDRESSOGRAPH" and carbon-copy routing ("WHITE - MEDICAL RECORD / CANARY - PATIENTS"), confirming its origin as a physical paper form from 2014 that has never been modernized.

Delivery options are limited to paper or **encrypted CD** — an anachronistic option in 2026 with no email, portal, or electronic transfer available through the form itself.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form includes a **witness signature line**, which is not required by HIPAA for patient access requests and could prevent patients from completing the form at home. A Broward Health authorized signature line is also present, suggesting the form may have been designed for in-person processing. No notarization is required. Fees are referenced vaguely ("reasonable charge" per CFR 164.524) without specific amounts. The website notes approximately 3 business days for processing. Fax submission is available at facility-specific numbers, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Exceptional multilingual support**: Offering the ROI form in four languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese) reflects genuine attention to South Florida's linguistic diversity and is rare among U.S. healthcare organizations.
- **Swellbox online portal**: Provides a fully digital alternative pathway for patients who cannot or prefer not to use the PDF.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 citation**: References the HIPAA Right of Access regulation directly in patient rights disclosures.
- **Granular record type selection**: The detailed checklist with date-range filtering gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.

## Overall Assessment

Broward Health demonstrates genuine effort in accessibility through multilingual forms and an online portal alternative, but the underlying form infrastructure is outdated and not patient-access-oriented. The 2014-era generic ROI authorization, image-only English scan, lack of fillable fields, witness requirement, and inappropriate application of minimum necessary language to patient requests all reflect an organization that has not modernized its records request process to match the spirit of HIPAA's individual access rights. The Swellbox portal partially redeems the experience, but the PDF pathway — which remains prominently offered — falls short of modern standards. **Grade: C.**

# Grady Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's major public safety-net hospital operating under Grady Health System, provides patients with a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Three PDF documents were found: a current authorization form (form-1, revised 2/22), an older superseded version (form-2, revised 5/15), and a combined instructions-plus-form package (form-3, bundling the older form with a COVID-era cover page). None of these forms are tailored specifically for patient self-access — all are structured as "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information," framing the process as a release between two parties rather than an individual exercising their right of access.

## Access Pathway

Grady does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting someone else's records. All requesters use the same authorization form with identical "Request Information From" / "Release Information To" fields. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively addressing the form to themselves. The form does include "Personal" as a purpose option, and the documentation requirements section on page 2 distinguishes "Patients Requesting Their Own Medical Records" from third-party requests — but this distinction lives in the supporting text, not in the form design itself. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the main authorization form and the medical records page at gradyhealth.org/medical-records/. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without login, bot blocking, or broken links. The medical records page provides clear context for the forms. This earns high marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the current primary form, is a 2-page digitally-created PDF with a text layer and clean layout. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. For a digitally-created document with 12 embedded fonts, this is a missed opportunity. The form is logically organized (demographics → from/to parties → date range → record types → purpose → format/method → legal notices → signature) with clear section delineation. The record type selection offers approximately 25 checkboxes across three categories (Hospital Visits, Office Visits, Diagnostic Imaging), giving patients granular control.

The language is mostly accessible, with the opening instruction plainly stating what the form does. However, the legal sections contain dense language including a broad liability waiver: "I will not hold Grady... responsible for anything that may happen from the use or release of my PHI." The completeness warning — "If any selection is incomplete, this form may be considered invalid" — could discourage submission if patients are uncertain about any field.

## Submission & Delivery

Critically, **submission options are limited to in-person drop-off and postal mail only**. The form-3 cover page explicitly lists only these two options for submitting the completed form. No fax number is provided for form submission, no email submission is available, and no online portal exists. This means a patient cannot complete the entire process without either physically visiting the hospital or waiting for postal mail.

For *receiving* records, options are better: the current form-1 offers encrypted email delivery, paper, CD, mail, pick-up, and fax (continuing care only). Form-3's cover page also references electronic delivery through CIOX Health (now Datavant), with 2-business-day processing for electronic and 7–10 days for mail.

## Barriers & Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The broad liability waiver bundled into the authorization is the most significant concern — patients should not be asked to waive accountability as a condition of records access. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which exceeds what's needed when photo ID is also required. Mandatory government-issued photo ID may burden patients of a safety-net hospital who lack such documentation.

**Bright spots**: The encrypted email delivery option on form-1 is genuinely uncommon and valuable. The form-3 cover page provides excellent operational guidance — processing timelines, fee disclosure ($6.50 max), and the note that continuing care requests are free. Multiple delivery format options (paper, CD, email) give patients real choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

Grady Memorial Hospital makes its forms easy to find and offers some progressive delivery options, but falls short on two critical dimensions: the forms are entirely paper-based (non-fillable, print-and-handwrite only) and submission requires physical delivery. The generic authorization form does not center patient self-access, and the liability waiver raises compliance concerns. For a major public hospital, the absence of any digital submission pathway and the reliance on a third-party release form for patient access represent meaningful barriers. **Grade: C.**

# The Iowa Clinic — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

The Iowa Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in West Des Moines, Iowa. Notably, the organization has fully transitioned away from downloadable PDF authorization forms: all medical records requests are now handled through third-party online platforms. The two PDF forms evaluated (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf) were retrieved exclusively from the Wayback Machine and date from approximately 2012–2015. They are no longer available on the live website.

## Available Pathways and Current State

The Iowa Clinic's medical records page (https://www.iowaclinic.com/for-patients/payment-billing/medical-records/) routes patients through four distinct channels depending on who is requesting records:

1. **Patient self-requests**: Datavant/Swellbox Health Record Wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/iowa-clinic-wizard.html) — an online portal for patients to request their own records.
2. **Imaging records**: A Formstack-powered web form on the Iowa Clinic website.
3. **Healthcare providers**: A separate Swellbox wizard.
4. **Third-party organizations**: SmartRequest portal (https://smartrequest.com).

This multi-channel architecture is the most relevant finding: The Iowa Clinic **does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release** at the website level, routing patients to a dedicated Swellbox wizard while directing third-party organizations to a separate SmartRequest portal. This structural separation is a meaningful strength.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page itself was straightforward — it's accessible under For Patients > Payment & Billing > Medical Records. However, finding downloadable PDF forms required significant effort since none exist on the current site. The PDFs were only recoverable through Wayback Machine archive searches of defunct URLs (`/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf` and `/static/docs/medical-records-release-form.pdf`). No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Historical Form Quality (form-1.pdf — Primary Evaluated Form)

Form-1.pdf is the newer of the two historical forms — a single-page "Authorization for Release of Information" with a clean digital layout (not a scan), text layer present, but **zero fillable fields**. It would require printing and handwriting. The form has approximately 15 fields including patient demographics, record-type checkboxes (8 options), destination address, purpose of release (6 options plus "Other"), sensitive-information opt-out initials, and signature. The layout follows a logical flow and fits everything on one page without excessive cramming.

The language is a mix of plain and semi-legal. Disclosure paragraphs are readable but contain some dense constructions. The form includes a "Request by patient" purpose option, which is a bright spot — acknowledging patient-initiated access even within a form designed primarily for third-party release. Submission was by fax (515-875-9600) or mail only.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection**: Both forms request Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The electronic transmission clause shifts all liability for misdirected fax/email to the patient, which is an overreach.
- **Fees**: The forms mention a "cost-based fee" without specifying amounts — compliant language but leaves patients unable to anticipate costs.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax and mail were offered as submission methods on the historical forms; the current online portal eliminates even these steps.

## Notable Strengths

The Iowa Clinic's most significant strength is its forward-looking transition to a fully digital, portal-based workflow. By routing patient requests through Swellbox/Datavant — a purpose-built health records request platform — the organization has eliminated the print-fill-fax cycle entirely for patients with internet access. The website's clear separation of patient requests from third-party requests demonstrates awareness of the distinction between individual access rights and authorization-based release.

## Overall Assessment

The Iowa Clinic presents a bifurcated picture. Its **current state** is strong: the organization has modernized beyond PDF forms to online portals with clear pathway differentiation. However, the **historical forms** we could directly evaluate were generic ROI authorization forms with no fillable fields, SSN collection, and liability waivers. Scoring reflects the best available current pathway (the Swellbox portal) while noting that the only downloadable form documents available for detailed quality assessment are from 2012–2015 and no longer represent the patient experience. For a patient requesting their own records today, The Iowa Clinic offers a patient-centered, digitally accessible process.

# Synthesis: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital

## Overview

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital in Murfreesboro, TN is part of Ascension, the largest nonprofit Catholic health system in the U.S. For medical records requests, the hospital relies on two pathways: a **Swellbox-based online request wizard** (the primary pathway linked from the patient portal page) and a **downloadable PDF authorization form** (STHS490) shared across the entire Ascension Saint Thomas system in Tennessee. Only the PDF form was available for detailed evaluation. No dedicated patient access request form was found — the single PDF serves both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information at the form level. The PDF form (STHS490) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Disclosure of PHI" that handles both use cases through a single "and/or" construction: patients can check "Use my health information" and/or "Disclose my health information to the following individual or organization." A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same form — including specifying themselves as the recipient — as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), the 30-day response obligation, or patient-specific fee limits.

However, the existence of the **Swellbox online wizard** as the primary pathway is significant. Though we could not evaluate the wizard's internal design, the fact that patients are directed to an online request tool — rather than solely to a downloadable PDF — suggests a more modern and potentially more patient-friendly experience as the default path. This partially mitigates the generic nature of the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form was **easy**. A targeted Google search on the second attempt returned a direct link. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or browser fallback was needed. The form is hosted on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure (the URL path includes "legacy"), suggesting it predates the current website architecture and is discoverable primarily via search engines rather than site navigation. The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, is linked from the patient portal page via normal site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF form (STHS490) is a **single page** — concise and complete. It uses a numbered structure (items 1–7) with a logical flow from patient identification through record type selection, rights notice, and signature. The record type checklist (ten options plus "Other") gives patients meaningful control over scope. Contact phone numbers for all eight Saint Thomas facilities are listed, which is helpful.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. The layout is dense, with small fonts (likely 8–9pt in places) cramming all content onto one page. Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese, particularly in the revocation clause (item 5). There are no separate instructions, no multilingual versions, and no plain-language summary of patient rights.

The form offers **mail and email delivery** checkboxes (item 7), which is better than forms limited to mail or in-person pickup. Combined with the Swellbox wizard for online submission, a patient has viable electronic pathways available.

## Barriers

The most notable barrier is the **SSN field combined with "ALL BLANKS MUST BE COMPLETED"** — implying SSN is mandatory. HIPAA does not require SSN for a records authorization, and requiring it creates both a privacy risk and a potential deterrent. The form also uses stale branding ("Saint Thomas Health" in body text vs. "Ascension Saint Thomas" in footer) and has a filename/form number mismatch (sths409 vs. STHS490), which are minor but erode trust in document currency.

No notarization or witness is required. No fees are mentioned on the form. The six-month default expiration is reasonable.

## Strengths

- **Online alternative (Swellbox wizard)** as the primary pathway
- **Email delivery option** on the PDF form
- **Granular record type checklist** with helpful descriptions
- **HIM contact numbers** for all facilities listed directly on the form
- **Easy findability** — no search difficulties

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox online wizard as the primary pathway is a meaningful strength that elevates the organization above those relying solely on PDF forms. However, the PDF form itself — the only document available for detailed evaluation — is a generic third-party authorization form with no fillable fields, an implied SSN requirement, and no acknowledgment of patient self-access as a distinct right. The organization earns credit for offering electronic pathways but falls short on patient-centeredness and form document quality.

# Northwest Colorado Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Northwest Colorado Health is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms on its website: one for behavioral health records (form-1) and one for medical/dental records (form-2). Both are single-page PDFs available from a dedicated patient forms page. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient-access form — both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any release of information, whether to the patient themselves or to a third party.

## Access Pathway

Northwest Colorado Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Request Information FROM" / "Release Information TO" structure, treating a patient requesting their own records identically to someone authorizing release to an insurer, attorney, or another provider. The "Release Information TO" section does list "Self / Legal Guardian" as a pre-printed option, which at least acknowledges that patients may be the intended recipient, but the form's structure, legal language, and scope options are all oriented toward the general authorization use case.

Patients who received both medical and behavioral health services at this facility would need to complete **two separate forms** — a meaningful friction point not faced by those seeking release to a single third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped web search located the patient forms page at a logical URL path (`/what_you_can_do/patient-resources/patient-forms/english.html`). Both forms were publicly linked, downloadable without authentication, and no bot-blocking or CAPTCHA was encountered. The download URLs are GUID-based and not human-readable, but this is a minor cosmetic issue.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form for patient self-access is form-2 (Medical and/or Dental), as it covers the broadest category of records most patients would seek. Key observations:

- **Fillability:** Despite metadata reporting 43 field annotations, the form is functionally a flat PDF — not practically fillable. Patients must print and complete by hand.
- **Length:** A single page, which is commendably concise. However, this compresses a substantial amount of content into a tight layout.
- **Language:** The introductory paragraph is notably patient-friendly: "We value your privacy at Northwest Colorado Health. Legally, we cannot release your written health record to anyone (including you) without your specific consent." The tone shifts to denser legal language in the six numbered disclaimers but remains reasonably readable.
- **Layout:** Logically organized with clear sections — patient info, FROM/TO entities, record types, purpose, sensitive-information authorization, signature, and legal paragraphs. Checkbox-driven options for record types and disclosure purposes reduce writing burden.
- **Instructions:** The form provides adequate contextual guidance but lacks explicit step-by-step instructions. Critically, it provides **no submission instructions** — a patient who downloads and completes the form has no guidance on where or how to send it (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link for submission).

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection:** Both forms request the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for identity verification under HIPAA and creates a data security risk.
- **No submission method stated:** The absence of submission instructions is a significant barrier. The Privacy Officer's mailing address appears only in the revocation clause, not as a submission destination.
- **No fee disclosure:** The forms neither mention fees nor state that patient access is free, leaving cost ambiguity.
- **Legacy organization name:** The revocation section refers to "Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association," the organization's former name, which could confuse patients despite the form's 04/2020 revision date.

## Bright Spots

- **Fast processing commitment:** "Up to 48 business hours" (~6 business days) is well within HIPAA's 30-day window and more specific and faster than most organizations promise.
- **Plain-language introduction:** The opening paragraph is warm, clear, and patient-friendly — significantly better than the legalistic openings common on ROI forms.
- **Photocopy validity:** The form states that photocopies are as valid as originals, reducing barriers for patients.
- **Non-retaliation statement:** Clearly states that care and payment will not be affected by declining to sign.
- **Easy findability:** Forms are publicly accessible without login or barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Northwest Colorado Health provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find, concise, and written with an unusually patient-friendly tone. However, the organization funnels all requests through a generic authorization form with no differentiation for patient self-access, collects unnecessary SSNs, provides no submission instructions, and offers only a print-and-handwrite workflow. The split into two separate forms by record category adds friction for patients. This is a typical small independent FQHC approach — adequate but not designed with the patient's individual access rights as a first-class concern.

# Nemaha Valley Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital, an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Seneca, Kansas, provides two documents on its Resources page: an "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-2.pdf). The authorization form is the only mechanism available for patients to request their records. A Spanish-language version of the authorization form is also linked from the same page but was not separately downloaded for evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for disclosures to named third parties — a patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient and navigate fields (purpose, recipient address) that assume a third-party disclosure scenario. There is no mention of HIPAA § 164.524, no "right of access" language, and no separate pathway for individual access requests. The NPP, by contrast, does describe the right to inspect and obtain copies and even commits to providing records in electronic format upon request — but this information lives in a 12-page compliance document, not in the actual request form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) is accessible within two clicks from the homepage, and a site-scoped web search surfaced the link quickly. The page labels the form clearly as "Authorization for Release of Health Information." No bot blocking or access restrictions were encountered. General `filetype:pdf` searches did not return direct results, but this is a minor issue given how easily the form was found through site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a significant weakness. It is an **image-only scan** — a photocopy of a paper form scanned by a Savin copier in 2016, with zero extractable text, zero fillable fields, and no accessibility metadata. The revision date is January 2014, making it over a decade old. The form must be printed and filled out entirely by hand.

The layout is functional but dated, using a typewriter-style font with hand-drawn lines. Page 1 follows a logical sequence: patient identification, recipient designation, purpose, a 14-item record-type checklist, treatment date range, legal disclosures, and signature block. Page 2 is an internal cost-calculation worksheet that probably should not have been included in the patient-facing download — it shows per-page copy rates, labor charges, and staff-use fields for tracking releases. Both pages are erroneously labeled "Page 2 of 2."

The legal language is reasonably clear for a healthcare authorization form, but it is presented as dense paragraph text with no bold headings or visual breaks between disclosure sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable red flag is the **Social Security Number field**, which is prominently placed alongside name, birthdate, and MRN. SSN collection is unnecessary for medical records release and creates identity theft risk — especially concerning for a form that must be physically handled (printed, mailed, or hand-delivered).

The form provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address for the records department, no fax number, and no mention of email or portal submission. A patient would need to call the hospital to learn how to submit the completed form. The cost worksheet on page 2 references pick-up, mail, and fax as record delivery methods, suggesting fax capability exists, but no fax number is provided on the form itself.

Fees are very reasonable: $0.03 per page for copies, with a $3.90 per 15-minute labor charge. The per-page rate is well within HIPAA limits. The $10 charges for CDs and USB drives are dated but not egregious.

## Notable Strengths

Despite its weaknesses, the hospital has several bright spots. The availability of a **Spanish-language authorization form** is notable for a small rural hospital in Kansas. The **14-item record-type checklist** gives patients granular control over what is released. The **NPP is excellent** — recently updated (February 2026), it names a specific Privacy Officer with direct phone and email, commits to electronic format delivery, includes HIE participation transparency, and offers multilingual nondiscrimination taglines in 15+ languages. The contrast between the polished, current NPP and the decade-old scanned authorization form is striking.

## Overall Assessment

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital earns a **C grade**. The form is easy to find and fees are fair, but the core patient experience is undermined by an image-only scan that forces a fully paper-based workflow, a generic third-party authorization form with no patient access differentiation, an SSN field that creates unnecessary risk, and a complete absence of submission instructions. The hospital clearly has the capacity to produce quality digital documents (as evidenced by the NPP), but has not applied that capability to its records request process.

# Colquitt Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Colquitt Regional Medical Center (Moultrie, GA) is an independent, government-owned community hospital. The organization offers a single downloadable PDF form for medical records requests, found on its Health Records & Patient Portal page. No online portal, patient portal integration, or alternative digital pathway was identified for requesting records.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was retrieved: an "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for releasing records to third parties. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a patient portal–based records request workflow. The sole pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — though the form itself provides no submission instructions (no fax number, mailing address, or email).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as an authorization for disclosure to a named recipient (item 5 asks for recipient "Name" and "Address"). While item 6 includes a "my personal records" purpose checkbox — a helpful nod toward self-access — the form does not explain what a patient should enter as the recipient when requesting their own records. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of patient access rights, and no separate pathway or instructions for patients who simply want their own medical records. A patient must navigate a form designed for third-party release and adapt it to their self-access needs.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped search quickly identified the Health Records & Patient Portal page, and the form was linked with a clearly labeled "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button — approximately two clicks from the homepage. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy**, and no bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page scanned image** with no meaningful text layer (only 11 characters of noise extracted) and zero fillable fields. It was created in 2021 using scanning software ("Transform Foundation Server"), confirming it is a digitized paper form rather than a digitally authored document. The form is completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology, cannot be filled digitally, and must be printed and completed by hand.

Despite the poor technical quality, the content design is adequate. The 10-item numbered list provides a logical flow: patient identification → who may disclose → record types → sensitive information acknowledgment → recipient → purpose → legal terms → signatures. Twelve record-type checkboxes offer useful granularity. The language mixes plain English with some legal phrasing — mostly readable but occasionally dense (e.g., the revocation paragraph). There are no section headers, boxes, or visual groupings to aid navigation, but the single-page length keeps complexity manageable.

## Barriers

- **No submission instructions**: The form contains no fax number, mailing address, email, or department name. A patient downloading the form has no guidance on how to return it. The website's Health Records page may provide this information, but it is absent from the form itself.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" line is present, which may lead patients to believe a witness is required — HIPAA does not require this for patient access requests.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form makes no mention of fees or costs for records.
- **No date range field**: Patients cannot specify a time period for the records they want.
- **No delivery format options**: No choices for electronic vs. paper delivery.

## Bright Spots

- **Easy findability**: The form was prominently linked from a clearly labeled page.
- **Voluntariness statement**: Item 10 explicitly states that signing is voluntary and will not affect treatment.
- **Patient-controlled expiration**: Item 8 lets the patient set their own authorization expiration date.
- **"My personal records" purpose checkbox**: While the form is generic, this option at least acknowledges that patients may be requesting their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Colquitt Regional Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request pathway. The form is easy to find, but it is a scanned image that cannot be filled digitally, lacks submission instructions, and does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The technical quality is poor — an image-only scan with no fillable fields and no accessibility support. A patient attempting to request their own records faces a form not designed for their use case, must print and handwrite their responses, and receives no guidance on how to submit the completed form. The organization earns credit for findability and a few patient-friendly touches (voluntariness statement, patient-controlled expiration), but the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# The Baton Rouge Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

The Baton Rouge Clinic maintains three distinct medical records forms on a well-organized "Downloadable Forms" page: (1) an outbound release authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information FROM The Baton Rouge Clinic"), (2) an inbound transfer authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information TO The Baton Rouge Clinic"), and (3) a "Right of Access Form" citing HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 164.524. This three-form strategy shows unusual thoughtfulness — the clinic has differentiated between outbound third-party release, inbound records transfer, and patient-directed access, which is more than most organizations offer.

## Patient Self-Access Pathway

The Right of Access form (form-3) is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. At just one page and ~1,300 characters, it is admirably concise compared to the two-page authorization forms. It explicitly cites HIPAA Right of Access authority and offers a choice between electronic and hard copy delivery — a genuine bright spot that many organizations lack.

However, the form has a meaningful design flaw: it is framed entirely as a designee authorization, directing providers to disclose records "to: Name: ___." There is no clear option for a patient to request records for themselves; a patient wanting their own records would need to awkwardly write their own name in the recipient field. The form that most directly invokes the Right of Access isn't actually designed for the most common Right of Access use case — patient self-request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search immediately returned direct PDF links to the authorization forms. All three forms were hosted on a well-organized downloadable forms page at `batonrougeclinic.com/patient-information/downloadable-forms/` with no login, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering required. The one findability gap: the Right of Access form (form-3) was not surfaced by the initial web search and was only discovered by browsing the forms page directly. A patient searching specifically for "how to request my records" might land on the third-party release form instead.

## Form Document Quality

All three forms are flat PDFs with zero fillable fields, despite having clean text layers (not scans). Every form requires printing and hand-filling — a significant accessibility gap, particularly ironic for form-3, which explicitly offers electronic record delivery while requiring a paper submission process. Form-3 has a clean, simple layout with logical flow (patient name → designee → scope → format → duration → signature). The language is relatively plain and accessible. Form-1 uses an asterisk system to mark required fields, which is helpful, though it also requires a Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection burden that form-3 wisely avoids.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. None of the forms disclose fees or state response times. Form-1 includes a hold-harmless clause that goes beyond HIPAA requirements, though form-3 omits this — a more patient-friendly approach. Submission methods are poorly documented: form-1 provides a medical records email (medrecords@brclinic.com) and phone number for questions and urgent requests, but no form explicitly states how to submit the completed document. No fax number is provided. The mailing address appears in footers. A patient completing form-3 has no guidance on where or how to send it.

## Overall Assessment

The Baton Rouge Clinic demonstrates above-average organizational thinking about patient access — the three-form strategy and HIPAA Right of Access citation reflect genuine awareness of different use cases. The Right of Access form's conciseness and electronic delivery option are bright spots. However, the execution falls short in key areas: all forms lack fillable fields, submission pathways are unclear, and the Right of Access form's designee-only framing creates a confusing gap for patients seeking their own records. The clinic has the right structure but needs better implementation — fillable fields, explicit submission instructions, and a self-access option on the Right of Access form would substantially improve the patient experience.

# Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center (VGMHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Hillsboro, Oregon, serving a predominantly Latino patient population. The organization publishes four Release of Information–related documents on its website: the main HIPAA ROI authorization form in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), plus a Release of Verbal Health Information form in English (form-3) and Spanish (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records is form-1 (or form-2 for Spanish speakers).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

VGMHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. A patient wanting their own records must use the same general-purpose HIPAA Release of Information form designed for inter-provider exchanges and third-party releases. The form asks the patient to choose a direction ("Get information," "Give information," or "Get and give information") and specify a recipient provider/facility — a workflow that doesn't map cleanly to "I want a copy of my own records."

A partial mitigation exists: the form includes "For my own use" as a purpose checkbox alongside "Coordination of care" and "Insurance/Legal." This acknowledges patient self-access as a valid use case, but the patient still must navigate a form structured around bilateral information exchange rather than simple record retrieval. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal–based records request option visible on the website.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately returned direct links to the English ROI form, and the organization's Patient Forms page (https://virginiagarcia.org/get-care/patient-forms/) has a clearly labeled "Release of Information Forms" section grouping all four documents. The only friction points were technical: PDF links are embedded in Divi theme JavaScript click handlers rather than standard HTML anchor tags, and the initial Spanish PDF URL found via search returned an error page (the working URL differed by one character in the filename). Neither issue would meaningfully impede a typical patient clicking through the website.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English ROI form (form-1) is a **well-constructed, fillable interactive PDF** — a 2-page document with 54 interactive form fields, a full text layer, and clean digital typography. It was clearly born-digital, not a scan. The form follows a logical structure: patient identification → direction of release → recipient details → purpose and frequency → granular record type selection (9+ categories plus 4 sensitive-information opt-ins) → legal disclosures → signature block → staff-only section.

The language is mostly **plain and accessible**. The rights section clearly states patients don't need to sign to receive treatment, provides a 30-day processing timeline, and offers two concrete revocation pathways. One minor grammatical error exists ("If have not received your records" — missing "you").

A notable accessibility gap: all 54 fillable fields **lack accessible names** (`fillable_field_names: []`), meaning screen readers cannot identify what each field is for. This is a significant deficiency for an otherwise well-designed digital form.

## Barriers and Compliance

VGMHC imposes **no illegitimate barriers**. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, no witness signature needed, and no fees mentioned. The form header provides both a fax number (503-357-4371) and a PO Box address, enabling remote submission. The 30-day processing commitment aligns with HIPAA requirements.

One concern is the **open-ended authorization duration** — the form defaults to remaining in effect "until my care ends with Virginia Garcia," which could mean years or decades for a patient in an ongoing care relationship. While the patient can specify a different date, the default is unusually long compared to typical 1-year expirations.

The form does not explicitly cite the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or frame patient record requests as a distinct legal entitlement — it treats all authorization types equivalently under a general HIPAA authorization framework.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both the main ROI form and the verbal release form are available in full English and Spanish versions — not bilingual addenda, but complete standalone translations. For an FQHC serving a predominantly Spanish-speaking community, this is a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Granular record selection**: Patients can choose specific record types (progress notes with date range, immunizations, labs, dental, medications, imaging, consultations) rather than an all-or-nothing approach, with separate opt-ins for sensitive categories.
- **Active document governance**: Version numbering (v6), effective/revision dates, and department ownership (Compliance) demonstrate ongoing form maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Virginia Garcia earns a solid **B grade**. The organization makes its forms easy to find, provides a technically capable fillable PDF, offers meaningful bilingual access, and imposes no illegitimate barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway — a patient requesting their own records must navigate a generic authorization form designed for third-party releases. The form accommodates patient access (via the "For my own use" checkbox) but doesn't prioritize it. For an independent FQHC without portal infrastructure, this is a common pattern, and VGMHC handles it better than many peers thanks to its well-designed form documents and strong language accessibility.

# Merit Health Central — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Merit Health Central is a for-profit community hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, part of Community Health Systems (CHS) operating under the Merit Health brand. The facility uses system-standardized forms for records requests and also offers an online portal alternative via Swellbox. Two PDF forms were retrieved — English (HIM-1406) and Spanish (HIM-1406S) versions of the same document — both linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page.

## Available Pathways & Primary Form

The primary form (form-1.pdf, HIM-1406) is titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** — notably not "Authorization for Release" or similar third-party-oriented language. The form allows patients to request records for themselves, a personal representative, or a third party, with "Myself" listed as the first recipient option. A Spanish translation (form-2.pdf, HIM-1406S) with identical structure and 66 fillable fields is provided alongside. The website also offers an online request process via Swellbox (swellbox.com/merit-health-jackson-wizard.html), giving patients a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Merit Health Central does not maintain separate forms for patient self-access vs. third-party release — both use cases are served by the same HIM-1406 form. However, the form is clearly designed with patient self-access as the primary use case: the title, structure, and "Myself" first-option framing all signal a patient-access orientation. The form explicitly distinguishes recipients (self, personal representative, third party) with labeled options. This is a meaningful step above the generic third-party authorization model, even though a truly separate patient access pathway does not exist.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/request-medical-records`. The page sits under "Patients & Visitors" navigation with clearly labeled English and Spanish download links. An FAQ section addresses common questions about authorization, charges, and who can request records — providing useful context before the patient downloads anything. No bot-blocking or browser fallback issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a born-digital, single-page interactive PDF with 66 fillable fields — an exceptionally high count that means virtually every input area is digitally completable. The layout follows a logical seven-section flow: patient information, facility identification, record type selection (12 checkbox categories), sensitive information disclosure (5 categories with individual opt-in checkboxes), delivery method selection, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and direct, with clear section headers framed as patient-facing questions. The one-page format is impressively concise given the coverage.

The form offers five delivery methods: paper, email (with risk acknowledgment), removable media (DVD/USB/CD-ROM with password protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media with password protection is an unusually thoughtful option. The HIPAA acknowledgment in the footer — "This Healthcare Facility recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information" — explicitly references patient rights, though it could be more prominent.

## Barriers & Concerns

No major barriers were identified. No notarization is required, there is no in-person-only submission requirement, and the form avoids consent bundling. However, three ambiguities merit attention: (1) fee disclosure is vague — "There may be charges" with no amounts, schedules, or reference to HIPAA cost-based limits; (2) the form itself does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization (no fax number, email, or mailing address on the form); and (3) a witness signature field is present without explanation of when a witness is required, which may confuse patients completing the form remotely.

## Notable Strengths

The Spanish translation is a genuine bright spot — a fully functional, equally prominent parallel form rather than an afterthought. The Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital alternative for patients who prefer not to deal with PDF workflows. The patient-first titling and structure, comprehensive delivery options, and high fillable field count collectively demonstrate above-average attention to patient access needs. The system-standardized form (revised six times since 2018) suggests ongoing maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Merit Health Central provides a well-above-average patient records request experience. The combination of a patient-focused PDF form, Spanish translation, and online Swellbox portal covers multiple access modalities. The form's digital-first design, logical layout, and comprehensive options serve patients well. Minor shortcomings — vague fee language, missing submission instructions on the form itself, witness field ambiguity — prevent a top-tier rating but do not materially impede patient access. This is a solid B-level performance.

# Myrtue Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Myrtue Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Harlan, Iowa. The organization posts its medical records forms on a dedicated "Authorization + Release Forms" page under the Patients + Visitors section of its website. Two English-language forms were retrieved, along with references to their Spanish translations:

- **form-1.pdf** — "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (the primary ROI form)
- **form-2.pdf** — "Consent for Disclosure" (permission for verbal communication with designated individuals)

Form-1 is the document a patient would use to request copies of their own medical records. Form-2 serves a different purpose — authorizing the facility to discuss a patient's care by phone with family members or caregivers — and is not relevant to the patient self-access use case.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

Myrtue Medical Center does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party seeking authorization for release. Form-1 is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form with a bidirectional "From / To" layout. A patient requesting their own records must check Myrtue in the "From" column and write their own name and address in the "To" column's "Other" field. This works, but the form was clearly designed with third-party release as the primary use case — there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no streamlined self-request pathway, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A site-scoped web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's website provides a clearly labeled forms page reachable within two clicks from the homepage. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or login requirements were encountered. The PDF filenames are descriptive and include language and revision date. The form header includes complete HIM department contact information (phone, fax, and email), giving patients clear channels for questions and submission.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally designed PDF — concise and logically organized with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, from/to routing, record type selection, purpose, delivery method, legal disclosures, and signature. The language is mostly plain, with formal phrasing limited to the legal disclosures at the bottom. Record type options are granular, with appropriate handling of substance use disorder records under 42 CFR Part 2.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being designed in publishing software with 10 fonts and an embedded logo. All checkboxes and text blanks are static graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a missed opportunity — the June 2025 revision could have added interactive form elements with minimal effort.

## Submission and Delivery Options

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: MyChart Portal, mail, encrypted email, and in-person pickup. The inclusion of MyChart Portal and encrypted email is a genuine bright spot for a small rural facility. For form submission, the header lists fax (712-755-2640) and email (medicalrecords@myrtuemedical.org), meaning a patient can submit the completed form electronically. This meets the baseline for adequate electronic access.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required — only the patient or authorized representative signature. Fees are disclosed as subject to "reproduction fees in accordance with federal/state regulations," but no specific amounts are provided, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. The form includes required HIPAA authorization disclosures: right to revoke, no-conditioning statement, re-disclosure warning, and a one-year maximum expiration. However, because the form frames patient access as a § 164.508 authorization rather than a § 164.524 access request, patients may not understand that different fee rules and timelines apply to their own records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish translations available** for both forms — commendable for a small rural Iowa facility
- **MyChart Portal and encrypted email** as delivery options signal a digital-forward approach
- **Substance use disorder carve-out** with 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language reflects careful compliance
- **Recent revision** (June 2025) suggests active form maintenance
- **Single-page design** minimizes patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Myrtue Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with some genuinely progressive features (portal delivery, encrypted email, bilingual availability). However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing place it squarely in the middle tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Esse Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Esse Health is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in St. Louis, Missouri. Two documents were retrieved from their patient forms page: an Authorization for Release of Medical Information (form-1.pdf) and a communication/message authorization (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own health records. Notably, Esse Health also offers a DocuSign-based electronic submission pathway for the same ROI form, which meaningfully improves the overall patient experience.

## Access Pathway

Esse Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single ROI form (form-1.pdf) is a generic HIPAA authorization with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED BY" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields — a structure designed for records transfers between providers or releases to attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no separate section for individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient requesting their own records has different rights than a third party requesting records on someone's behalf.

The form does cite 45 CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA right of access provision), which is a positive signal, but this is buried in a dense paragraph of legal language rather than presented as guidance for patients. The availability of a DocuSign electronic submission option is a genuine bright spot — it allows patients to complete and submit the form digitally without printing, scanning, or visiting the office.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF URL, and the patient forms page at `essehealth.com/patient-center/patient-forms/` is well-organized with clear labeling under "General Forms." No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The retrieval was rated **easy**. One minor issue: the communication authorization form (form-2) has "Medical Records" in its website title, which could mislead a patient looking for the actual records release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF. While the metadata reports 28 fillable field annotations, the field names array is empty, suggesting the fields may not be properly configured for interactive use. The form relies on underline blanks — it was designed primarily as a print-and-write document. However, the DocuSign alternative compensates significantly by providing a fully interactive digital pathway.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, release from/to fields, 11 record-type checkboxes, sensitive information disclosure, revocation and expiration language, and signature. The language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese — the opening authorization statement is clear, but the disclosure paragraphs covering HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse are denser. At one page, the form is appropriately concise without being cramped.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment. It provides a six-month default expiration and a revocation mechanism, though the revocation language ("present my written cancellation to the health information management department") is ambiguous about whether this can be done remotely. Fee disclosure is vague — "there may be a charge associated with copying my health information" — with no specifics about amounts or HIPAA's cost-based limits. No delivery format options (electronic, paper, mail, pick-up) are mentioned, which is a gap for patient self-access scenarios. Submission options include the DocuSign electronic pathway, making electronic submission available.

## Overall Assessment

Esse Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The key strength is the DocuSign electronic submission option, which elevates the experience above many peers by enabling end-to-end digital completion and submission. The key weakness is the lack of any differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — the generic authorization form forces patients to navigate a process not designed for them. The form itself is clean and concise but not interactive, and the fee disclosure is vague. For an independent physician practice, this represents a middle-of-the-road effort: the form is easy to find and usable, but the organization has not invested in a patient-centered access pathway.

# Intermountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) is a community hospital within the Intermountain Health system (formerly Intermountain Healthcare), a major nonprofit health system operating across Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming. The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones — all three retrieved documents are branded and published by Intermountain Health at the enterprise level.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all hosted on Intermountain Health's website:

1. **Form 1** (legacy, 2017): "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — a general-purpose third-party release form. Non-fillable, branded under the old "Intermountain Healthcare" name. Effectively superseded but still accessible online.
2. **Form 2** (06/2025): "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — a fillable third-party disclosure form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug explicitly reads `request-records-be-sent-to-someone-else`.
3. **Form 3** (06/2025): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a fillable patient self-access form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug reads `request-records-for-yourself`.

The most relevant form for a patient requesting their own records is **form 3**, which is the primary basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Intermountain Health stands out for explicitly separating patient self-access from third-party release into **two distinct forms**. Form 3 is titled "Patient Request for Health Information," uses question-based section headings ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?"), and defaults to "Self" as the first delivery recipient option. This is meaningfully different from the common pattern of funneling all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form. The footer acknowledges the patient's right of access under HIPAA.

One blemish: Form 2 (the third-party form) confusingly includes a "Patient Access Information" section with bullets about supervised in-person review and photo ID requirements, blurring the line between the two forms. However, the existence of a separate, cleaner patient-access form mitigates this.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF download links with no login, portal, or JavaScript rendering required. No bot blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on two domains — the legacy `intermountainhealthcare.org` and the current `prod.intermountainhealth.org` — which creates minor confusion but did not impede retrieval. The URL paths are descriptive and logical.

## Form Document Quality (Form 3)

Form 3 is a single-page, fully fillable PDF with 48 interactive fields, Print/Clear buttons, and a clean numbered 7-section layout. The language is plain and direct — section headings are phrased as questions, and the instruction "Please fill out all sections to avoid delay" is practical. Record types are covered by 12 checkboxes spanning clinical, imaging, billing, and substance use categories. Delivery options include paper mail, in-person pickup, and electronic (email, USB, CD, portal, other) with a free-text specification field. At ~2,030 characters of text, the form is admirably concise with no dense legal boilerplate.

Submission methods include email, fax, and mail — organized by state (UT/ID routes to Murray, CO/NV/MT/WY routes to Broomfield). Email submission is a genuine accessibility feature enabling fully digital completion and submission.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. Multiple remote submission options (email, fax, mail) are available — no in-person-only restriction. Fee language is vague: "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records" without specifying amounts, which could deter patients. The UT/ID email routes to R1 RCM (`MedRecReq@r1rcm.com`), a third-party vendor, without explanation on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-access form** separate from third-party authorization — uncommon and patient-centered
- **48 fillable fields** on a single page with Print/Clear buttons — excellent digital-first design
- **Question-based section headings** make the form feel conversational rather than bureaucratic
- **Email submission accepted** — a fully digital pathway from completion to submission
- **Electronic delivery explicitly offered** including email, USB, CD, portal, and "other"
- **Multilingual interpretation notices** on the legacy form (Chinese Traditional and Spanish)

## Overall Assessment

Intermountain Health provides one of the stronger patient access experiences in this study. The deliberate separation of patient self-access from third-party release, combined with a well-designed fillable form and multiple electronic submission channels, demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness. The form's plain language, logical structure, and concise single-page format make it accessible without assistance. Minor weaknesses — vague fee disclosure, undisclosed vendor routing, and a confusing legacy form still online — prevent a top-tier score but do not materially impede patient access.

# EyeSouth Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a practice management organization (PMO) headquartered in Atlanta, GA, operating a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. It is a HIPAA covered entity with a designated Privacy Officer, but the corporate website is entirely partnership-focused with no patient-facing content. Two ROI forms were retrieved — neither from EyeSouth Partners itself, but from individual affiliates: Center for Sight (Florida) and Georgia Retina (Georgia).

## Available Pathways

A patient seeking records from an EyeSouth Partners affiliate faces a fragmented landscape. The parent organization offers no downloadable form, no patient portal, and no records request page. Its privacy policy directs patients to write to the Privacy Officer at corporate headquarters — a mail-only pathway with no form to guide the request. Individual affiliates handle records requests independently: some offer downloadable PDF forms (Center for Sight, Georgia Retina), others use third-party online portals like Sharecare (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye Partners), and at least one has a broken forms page (Georgia Eye Partners, returning 404).

The most relevant forms for patient self-access are the two retrieved PDF forms. **Form 1** (Center for Sight) is a concise, plain-language "Medical Information Release Form" with a patient-friendly tone and 10-business-day processing commitment. **Form 2** (Georgia Retina) is a more detailed "Authorization for Use, Release, or Request of Your Health Information" with HIPAA rights statements but also a $25 fee disclosure and a reason-for-release requirement. Both are one-page, single-purpose authorization forms. Form 1 represents the better patient experience overall and is treated as the primary form for scoring purposes.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to move records "to or from" the affiliated practice. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal right to their own records without needing to provide a reason. The parent organization provides no pathway at all — a patient who only knows they received care "under EyeSouth Partners" would struggle to find any usable process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms required significant effort. Direct searches for "EyeSouth Partners" ROI forms returned nothing. The corporate website has no patient resources section. Forms were located only by identifying specific affiliated practices and searching their individual websites. This multi-step, knowledge-dependent process is a major barrier: a patient must already know which specific practice treated them, find that practice's website, and hope a form is posted there.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms have a text layer (not image-only scans) but **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete by hand. Form 1 uses plain, accessible language with a logical top-down flow (patient info → sender/receiver → date range → reasons → authorization → signature). Its listing of 11 Center for Sight locations with full addresses and fax numbers is dense but functional for identifying where to send the form. Form 2 is more text-dense, with rights disclosures consuming half the page and no visual section headers or dividers. Neither form offers checkboxes for record types, format/delivery options, or electronic submission instructions.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form 1 contains an indefinite authorization ("will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing") with no automatic expiration — potentially problematic under HIPAA § 164.508. Form 2 discloses a flat $25 fee for record reproduction without distinguishing patient access requests (where HIPAA fee limits apply) from third-party releases. Form 2 also asks patients to "list the reason for releasing this information," which HIPAA does not require for patient access. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both imply fax submission is available through listed fax numbers. Form 2 is dated June 2016 — nearly a decade old, predating the HHS Right of Access Initiative and the Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Notable Strengths

- Form 1's 10-business-day processing commitment sets a clear, HIPAA-compliant expectation
- Form 1's warm closing ("we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care") is unusually humanizing
- Both forms are appropriately concise at one page each
- No notarization or witness requirements on either form

## Overall Assessment

EyeSouth Partners presents a below-average patient experience for records access. The fundamental problem is structural: a decentralized PMO with no centralized patient-facing process, forcing patients to navigate affiliate-specific pathways that vary widely in approach and quality. The best available forms are generic authorization documents that don't recognize patient self-access as a distinct use case. While the forms themselves are functional and concise, their paper-first design (no fillable fields), lack of patient rights language, and compliance issues (indefinite authorization, flat fee, reason requirement) prevent them from achieving more than a middling score. The organization earns a **C** grade, reflecting adequate but unexceptional service that requires a patient to work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights.

# Bath Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Bath Community Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Hot Springs, Virginia. The organization offers a single ROI form for medical records requests, hosted on its website. No patient portal, online request wizard, or alternative digital pathway was identified.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a one-page "Request of Information" PDF (`form-1.pdf`) branded under **Bath Community Physicians Group** rather than Bath Community Hospital itself. This branding mismatch is common among small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative infrastructure. The form is hosted on the hospital's website at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf` and linked from the Patient Resources → Forms page.

The form is a generic release-of-information authorization — it uses a "Send / Receive" and "To / From" structure designed primarily for inter-provider record transfers, not for patient self-access. A patient wanting their own records would need to adapt the form by marking "Send" and writing in their own name and address as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA individual access rights, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. A targeted web search surfaced the PDF directly, and the hospital's website links to it from a clearly labeled "Medical Records Request" section under Patient Resources. The URL path is descriptive. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. For a small critical access hospital, the form is reasonably discoverable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **scanned paper document** with an OCR text layer — not a digitally-created or fillable PDF. Despite metadata suggesting 21 fillable fields, the field names are empty and the form functions as a flat scan that must be printed and completed by hand. The OCR layer contains numerous errors ("ERNOTE," "LABffEST RESULTS," "IMAGINE REPORTS," "DISHCHARGE SUMMARY"), rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers and text-based search tools.

At one page with approximately 15 patient-completed fields, the form is appropriately brief. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → authorization direction → destination → reason → record type selection → signature block. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records consent paragraph is somewhat dense. No instructions are provided for how to complete or submit the form.

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access requests. This creates a real barrier — a patient must find someone to witness their signature before submitting. The form also requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, raising privacy concerns for a document that may be faxed.

No fees are mentioned. No response time commitment is stated. Submission instructions are absent; the header includes a fax number (540-962-7881), suggesting fax is an available submission method, but this is not explicitly stated. No in-person-only requirement is stated, so fax submission appears available.

## Notable Strengths

The form correctly separates consent for alcohol/drug abuse and psychiatric records into a dedicated checkbox — proper 42 CFR Part 2 practice that many organizations neglect. It also includes a checkbox for patients to request a copy of their signed authorization, a HIPAA requirement that many forms omit.

## Overall Assessment

Bath Community Hospital provides a minimally functional pathway for patients to request their records, but the experience is not patient-centered. The form was designed for provider-to-provider transfers and requires patients to adapt it for self-access. The scanned-image quality, OCR errors, witness requirement, and lack of submission instructions all create friction. While the form is findable and brief, it reflects an older, paper-first approach to health information management typical of small independent facilities. A patient could complete the process, but would receive little guidance and face an unnecessary witness barrier along the way.

# Piedmont Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Piedmont Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Rock Hill, SC, affiliated with Tenet Healthcare. Two authorization forms were found: a one-page hospital-specific form (form-1) and a two-page physician network form (form-2). The organization also contracts with Datavant and offers Swellbox online portals for both patient and provider record requests, which represents the most patient-friendly pathway.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The hospital's "Request Medical Records" page at piedmontmedicalcenter.com/patients/request-medical-records serves as the central hub, linking to: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (form-1), and (2) a Swellbox/Datavant online portal for patient record requests. A second PDF form (form-2) exists on the affiliated Piedmont Physician Network website but is not linked from the hospital's main medical records page.

Form-1 is the primary PDF document for hospital record requests. It is a single-page "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" form (EZ-7003, revised 2013). The Swellbox portal, however, is likely the pathway the organization most actively directs patients toward for digital submission.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither PDF form is a dedicated patient-access form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 does include a "Self" checkbox under the PURPOSE section, acknowledging that a patient may be requesting their own records, but the form's framing ("I authorize Piedmont Medical Center to disclose the following information...") and structure assume a third-party recipient scenario. Form-2 is even more clearly a third-party release form, with fields for "Name of Person or Class of Persons who may disclose" and "To release records to" — a structure that makes no sense for self-access.

The Swellbox portal provides a meaningful alternative. By offering separate portals for patient and provider requests, the organization does create some differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — though this differentiation exists at the portal level, not in the PDF forms themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately returned the medical records page URL and direct PDF links. The medical records page is well-organized and clearly labeled. The only technical hurdle was Cloudflare bot protection blocking automated downloads, requiring browser-based retrieval — a hosting infrastructure issue that could also affect assistive technologies.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1** (primary hospital form) is a non-fillable PDF with zero interactive fields. Despite having labeled fields for patient name, date of birth, address, and various checkboxes for record types, all are static text requiring print-and-fill completion. The form is compact at one page with a logical layout organized into PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION REQUESTED, PURPOSE, and INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO sections. Record type options are granular, with 14+ checkboxes covering specific document types plus a write-in option.

The language is moderately legalistic, particularly the liability release and re-disclosure clauses. Template merge fields (`«PatientNumberBarcode»`, `«PatientName»`, etc.) are visible at the bottom of the public PDF, indicating an unprocessed template extracted from the hospital's document management system — confusing for patients and unprofessional in appearance. A typo ("in ability" for "inability") in the legal representative attestation is concerning for a legal document.

**Form-2** (physician network form) is more comprehensive at two pages but also entirely non-fillable. Its standout feature is granular opt-in checkboxes for seven categories of highly confidential information (mental health, psychotherapy notes, HIV/AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, sexual assault, child abuse/neglect). However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, carries no organizational branding, has a date field locked to "200_" (rendering one term option unusable since 2010), and provides no Privacy Office contact information.

## Barriers and Compliance

Neither form requires notarization or in-person submission. Neither mentions fees. Both include standard HIPAA disclosures: revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warnings. Form-1's six-month default expiration is reasonable. The liability release clause on Form-1 — releasing the hospital "from any legal responsibility or liability" — is unnecessary for patient self-access and could discourage patients from exercising their rights. Both forms are notably outdated (2013 and pre-2010 respectively), predating significant regulatory updates.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** for patient record requests provides a modern digital pathway beyond the paper forms
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear organization and multiple access options
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** (14+ options on form-1) give patients meaningful control
- **Granular sensitive information opt-in** on form-2 (seven separate categories) represents strong practice

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — both PDFs are generic third-party authorization forms
- **Zero fillable fields** on either form — entirely print-and-fill
- **Severely outdated forms** (one from 2013, one from pre-2010)
- **Visible template merge fields** on form-1 indicate an unprocessed internal template
- **SSN requested** on form-2 (unnecessary privacy risk)
- **Liability release clause** on form-1 (inappropriate for patient self-access)

## Overall Assessment

Piedmont Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional patient records request experience. The organization's investment in a Swellbox/Datavant online portal significantly improves the digital pathway, compensating for PDF forms that are entirely paper-oriented and outdated. The medical records page is easy to find and well-organized. However, the underlying PDF forms show their age — neither has been updated in over a decade, neither offers fillable fields, and neither is designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. The organization earns a B grade, buoyed by the portal alternative and reasonable findability, but held back by paper-era form design and a generic authorization approach that doesn't center patient access rights.

# Hartford Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hartford Hospital is part of Hartford HealthCare (HHC), a regional nonprofit health system in Connecticut. For medical records requests, the organization uses the system-wide "Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information" form (HH Forms 571559, Rev. 11-2022), a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all 11 HHC facilities. Three PDF documents were retrieved: the system-wide form hosted on two different HHC domains (form-1 and form-3, which are textually identical), and an older Institute of Living–specific variant from 2012 (form-2). The primary form for a patient seeking their own records is form-1.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Route

Hartford Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The system-wide form is a general-purpose authorization designed equally for third-party release (to insurers, attorneys, other providers) and patient self-access. The form's structure — "I authorize _____ to disclose/obtain health information to: ______" — is fundamentally oriented around third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must puzzle over which blank to fill with the hospital's name and which with their own.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient" as one checkbox alongside "Medical," "Legal," "Disability," and "Insurance," correctly marked as "(Optional)." But the form offers no simplified pathway, no separate section, and no explanatory text for patients exercising their Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524. The patient must navigate the same form and fields designed for attorneys and insurance companies.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The parent system's medical records page at `hartfordhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/patients/medical-records` is well-organized and links directly to the authorization form. However, a patient starting at `hartfordhospital.org` must navigate to the parent system's site. A previously indexed URL for the form now returns a 404 error, meaning patients following older search results or bookmarks encounter a dead link. The current URL uses an opaque numeric filename (`571559.pdf`) that gives no indication of the document's contents.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised in November 2022, every field is rendered as static underscored blank lines. A patient must print the form and complete it by hand — or use a PDF annotation tool as a workaround. For a major regional health system, the absence of any interactive form fields is a significant missed opportunity.

The layout is dense but logically organized: patient identification → source/destination → delivery method → record types → purpose → rights/signature. However, the form opens with staff-facing administrative fields (MR#, Date Completed, Pages Copied, Initials) that have no relevance to patients and may cause confusion. The record type section offers 19 checkbox options — useful granularity for specificity but potentially overwhelming for patients who simply want "my records." Sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse, reproductive health) are appropriately broken out with corresponding legal notices on page 2.

The language is moderately legalistic. The opening sentence is a dense multi-clause construction that packs in references to mental illness, substance abuse, HIV, and reproductive services. Page 2's legal notices contain typographical errors ("If the event" instead of "In the event") and inconsistent capitalization.

## Submission Methods and Barriers

The form lists fax numbers and mailing addresses for all 11 HHC facilities, making submission by fax or mail straightforward. There is no email address, web portal, or online submission option. Fax qualifies as an adequate electronic pathway per our scoring baseline.

**No notarization or witness is required.** No fees are mentioned on the form. The form correctly states that treatment is not conditioned on signing the authorization, and that the patient may inspect or copy their information. The purpose field is correctly marked optional.

## Bright Spots

- **Comprehensive facility directory**: All 11 HHC facilities listed with addresses and fax numbers as checkboxes, eliminating the common pain point of not knowing where to send the form.
- **Connecticut-specific protections**: Detailed legal notice blocks for HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, and reproductive health records, citing applicable state and federal law.
- **Purpose marked optional**: Correctly implements the HIPAA principle that patients need not justify access requests.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Separate checkboxes for specially protected categories give patients granular control.

## Red Flags

- **Stale URL returning 404**: Older links to the form lead to a dead end.
- **Confusing dual-purpose "disclose/obtain" structure**: Patients must determine which direction of information flow applies to them.
- **"Electronic" delivery undefined**: Listed as an option with no explanation of what it means in practice.
- **Typographical errors**: Multiple instances of "If the event" instead of "In the event" on page 2.

## Overall Assessment

Hartford Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request experience. The system-wide form covers the basics and includes appropriate compliance language, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and generic third-party authorization structure all represent missed opportunities to serve patients well. The form is a C-grade experience: a patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them in mind.

# San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center — Synthesis

## Overview

San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center (SLV Health-RMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Alamosa, Colorado, part of the San Luis Valley Health regional system that also includes Conejos County Hospital (La Jara). The organization makes three PDF forms available online: a current English-language authorization form (form-1), a superseded 2013 English version (form-2, still publicly accessible but no longer linked), and a Spanish-language translation (form-3). All three are generic "Authorization to Release Medical Record Information" forms — none is designed specifically for patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Access Pathway

SLV Health does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All three forms use a "RELEASE FROM" / "RELEASE TO" structure designed for authorizing disclosure to a named recipient — an attorney, insurer, or other provider. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves in the "RELEASE TO" field, which is workable but unintuitive. There is no checkbox, pathway, or language acknowledging that a patient might simply want to access their own health information. No patient portal or online request wizard is offered for records requests.

The primary pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, then email the completed form to `MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org` or mail it to the facility. The email submission option is a meaningful convenience that prevents the need for in-person delivery.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **very easy**. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the organization's Medical Records page (`/patient-center/medical-records/`) clearly links to both the English and Spanish authorization forms. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only concern is that the older form-2 remains publicly accessible at its original URL and could surface in search results, potentially confusing patients about which version to use.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with extractable text — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are visual underlines meant for handwriting, and there is a "Patient Sticker" area intended for in-facility paper workflows. The form cannot be completed electronically within the PDF itself. This is clearly a print-oriented document.

The layout is dense but logically organized, flowing from facility identification through patient info, record type selection (six categories with initial-based checkboxes), expiration options, sensitive-condition authorization, and signature block. The language is moderately legalistic but generally understandable — the authorization statement is reasonably clear. Section headers provide hierarchy, though the initial-based checkbox convention `( )` requires familiarity.

The form lacks instructions or guidance text, offers no statement of patient rights, and makes no reference to HIPAA, turnaround times, or fees.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests Social Security Numbers as a standard identification field alongside name and date of birth — unnecessary for a records release authorization and creating identity theft risk. This is particularly concerning given the community's demographics.

The vague disclaimer **"San Luis Valley Health is not responsible if lost"** is poorly worded and could deter patients from submitting forms remotely. The **copies clause** (MAY/MAY NOT be used with same effectiveness as original) places an opaque legal decision on patients. A persistent **spelling error** ("INFORMATION REQUIRIED") has survived at least two revision cycles, suggesting limited quality control.

No notarization is required. No in-person submission is required. No fees are disclosed — neither their presence nor absence is mentioned.

## Bright Spots

The **Spanish-language form** is a genuine strength. It is co-located with the English version on the Medical Records page, requiring no extra navigation — appropriate and commendable for a community hospital serving the San Luis Valley's significant Latino population. The **email submission option** lowers the barrier compared to fax-only or mail-only processes. The **single-page design** is efficient, and the **granular record-type options** give patients meaningful control over scope.

## Overall Assessment

SLV Health-RMC earns credit for easy findability, bilingual support, and email submission — things many organizations fail to provide. However, the lack of a patient-specific access pathway, absence of fillable fields, SSN collection, and missing rights information keep this solidly in the middle tier. A patient can navigate the process, but the organization hasn't designed it with patient self-access in mind. The form serves its historical purpose as a generic release authorization; it has not evolved to meet the expectations of a patient-centered digital healthcare landscape. **Grade: C.**
