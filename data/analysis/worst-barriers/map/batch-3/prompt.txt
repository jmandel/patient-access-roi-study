You are analyzing ROI form retrieval results for a study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city). Use this to contextualize your findings by org type.

Your task: identify the most significant barriers patients would face when trying to
request their records from organizations in this batch. Look for:
- Difficulty finding the form
- Burdensome requirements imposed on patients
- Poor technical accessibility
- Anything that would frustrate or discourage a patient

Write your findings to "output.md". For each barrier:
- Name the organization and describe the problem
- Explain the impact on patients
- Note whether this seems like an oversight or a pattern

End with a brief summary of barrier patterns across this batch.
Keep to 500-1000 words.

# Lane County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lane County Hospital is a government-owned, independent critical access hospital in Dighton, Kansas. The facility offers a single pathway for medical records requests: a one-page PDF authorization form available on its website. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient self-access form.

## Available Pathways and Form Classification

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "Authorization for Release of Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for third-party release of information. It uses the standard disclosure structure — "I authorize [entity] to disclose... to [name]" — which frames the transaction as releasing records to someone other than the patient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the authorizing party and the recipient, navigating a form that was not designed with their use case in mind.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access requests and third-party authorization releases. There is no separate patient access request form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 individual access rights, and no streamlined process for patients who simply want to review or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was exceptionally easy. A basic web search immediately identified the hospital's Records Request page, which contains a single "Click Here" link to the PDF. No login, bot blocking, or portal navigation was required. For a small rural hospital, this level of web accessibility is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally created PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore lines, requiring the patient to print the form and complete it by hand (or use third-party PDF annotation tools). The form is one page long with a logical flow: patient identification at top, authorization body, 16 record-type checkboxes, legal disclosures, and signature block. The record-type checkboxes offer strong granularity — 16 categories from Anesthesia Records to Social Work Reports — giving patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.

The language is a mix of plain language and standard legal boilerplate. Some sentences are convoluted ("I understand that I may refuse to sign this Authorization and that my treatment of payment for my treatment will not be affected...") but the form is generally readable. The title contains a typo ("HEATH" instead of "HEALTH") that has persisted since at least 2018. "Psychotherapy Notes" appears twice in the checkbox list, and a cryptic "RESOURCE: MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FORM" reference at the bottom could confuse patients.

## Submission and Barriers

The form directs patients to return it via **fax** to one of two numbers. No email, mail, or online submission option is mentioned. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway.

Two unnecessary barriers stand out. First, the form requests a **Social Security Number**, which is not required for HIPAA-compliant release processing and creates identity theft risk on a form routinely transmitted by fax. Second, a **witness signature line** creates an implicit expectation that a witness is needed, though HIPAA does not require one for valid authorization. Together these add friction and potential deterrence for patients acting alone.

No fees are mentioned. The form includes solid compliance elements: an expiration field, a citation of Kansas SB 119's one-year authorization limit, and clear revocation instructions naming the Privacy Officer with full contact information.

## Overall Assessment

Lane County Hospital makes its records request form easy to find and keeps it concise at one page with good record-type granularity. However, the form funnels all requesters — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization designed for disclosure to others, not for individual access. The lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, and the witness signature line create unnecessary friction. For a small critical access hospital, the web accessibility is commendable, but the form itself reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-centered approach to individual access rights.

# Desert Valley Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Valley Hospital (DVH) is a for-profit community hospital in Victorville, CA, part of the Prime Healthcare system. A patient attempting to request their own medical records online faces significant barriers: DVH's website describes the records request process but provides no downloadable authorization form. The only usable patient-facing form was found on a sister Prime Healthcare hospital's website (Chino Valley Medical Center), using a system-wide template that DVH presumably also uses but has not published.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved during an exhaustive search:

1. **Form-2 (PHSI-280-014 CVMC)** — the most relevant document. A 2-page general HIPAA authorization form from Chino Valley Medical Center, a Prime Healthcare sister hospital. This system-wide template is the standard patient ROI form across Prime Healthcare facilities. It has 47 fillable fields, granular record-type selection, and a clear patient rights section. However, it is branded for CVMC, not DVH.

2. **Form-1 (PHSI-320-012)** — an employee-only authorization for Prime Healthcare's internal health plan. Explicitly marked "FOR PRIME EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ENROLLED DEPENDENTS USE ONLY." Not applicable to general patients.

3. **Form-3** — an employment services authorization from Desert Valley Medical Group for occupational health services (DOT physicals, drug screens). Not an ROI form.

The DVH Medical Records page (dvmc.com/patients-visitors/medical-records/) instructs patients to submit requests via mail, fax, or in person, with a $15 fee and 14-business-day turnaround. No online portal, no downloadable form, and no email submission option are offered.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DVH does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The Prime Healthcare template (form-2) is a generic "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" designed for all release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both the authorizing entity and themselves as recipient — workable but not optimized for self-request. The form does include a "patient request" checkbox under Purpose, which at least acknowledges this use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was rated **Hard**. The dvmc.com website was thoroughly searched — including sitemap crawling and URL pattern probing — with no authorization form found. The Desert Valley Medical Group site yielded only the employment services form. Success required identifying the Prime Healthcare parent system and checking sister hospitals' websites. A typical patient would have no way to discover or download the form online.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2) has notable technical strengths: 47 fillable interactive fields allow on-screen completion, and the document has a full text layer. The 2-page layout follows a logical sequence — demographics, release details, record-type selection, purpose, expiration, patient rights, format options, and signature. The "MY RIGHTS" section uses clear first-person language explaining refusal rights, inspection rights, and revocation procedures. HITECH electronic format options (CD, paper, email) are explicitly cited.

However, weaknesses are present: the form requests a full Social Security Number (unnecessary and a privacy risk), the opening warns that incomplete forms "may invalidate this Authorization" (potentially coercive), a "Witness" line appears without guidance on whether it's required, the header contains a typo ("OR" instead of "OF"), and field names are not accessible (empty in metadata, potentially impacting screen readers). The 1.65 MB file size for a 2-page form reflects poor optimization.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is explicitly required. Fax submission is available (an adequate electronic pathway). The $15 fee is disclosed only on the website, not on the form itself. The SSN collection and completeness-invalidation warning are the most concerning compliance issues — SSN is not required by HIPAA for records requests, and the warning could pressure patients into providing unnecessary information. The witness line creates ambiguity that may deter patients. The "financially responsible party" listed as an authorized signer raises questions about conflating billing and health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 47 interactive fields — significantly better than many flat/print-only forms
- HITECH electronic format citation with email delivery option
- Granular sensitive-information consent (seven categories requiring individual initials)
- Clear patient rights section with California-specific re-disclosure language

## Overall Assessment

Desert Valley Hospital earns a **C grade**. While the underlying Prime Healthcare form template is reasonably well-designed with fillable fields and a clear rights section, the hospital's failure to publish any patient-facing form online creates a fundamental access barrier. A patient must either contact HIM by phone to obtain the form, visit in person, or discover it on a sister hospital's website — none of which constitute an accessible online pathway. The generic authorization design, SSN collection, and coercive completeness language further reduce patient-centeredness.

# Saratoga Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Saratoga Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Saratoga Springs, NY, now part of the **Albany Med Health System (AMHS)**. Its original website (saratogahospital.org) redirects to albanymed.org/saratoga/. Two authorization forms were found: an older Saratoga Hospital–specific form (form-1.pdf, dated 2020) and the current system-wide AMHS form (form-2.pdf, dated November 2024). The system-wide form is the one actively linked from the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page and is the primary form a patient would encounter today.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release, Not Patient Access

Neither form offers a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both are titled "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" and are structured as third-party release authorizations. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Release Information To" / "Disclose To" field and select a purpose — an awkward workaround for what should be a straightforward right-of-access request. There is no checkbox, section, or simplified flow for "I want my own records." Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or explains patient access rights beyond the right to revoke authorization.

The system-wide form (form-2) does include a sidebar callout to **MyChart** (mychart.albanymed.org), the AMHS patient portal, as an alternative pathway. This is a meaningful digital option, though the form does not clarify what records are accessible through MyChart or whether it satisfies a full records request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A general web search returned direct links, and the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page is accessible without login or bot blocking. The only complexity is the redirect from the Saratoga Hospital domain to Albany Med, which could momentarily confuse a patient searching by the old hospital name. Both PDFs downloaded without difficulty.

## Form Document Quality (Primary: form-2.pdf)

The system-wide form is a strong technical document. It is a digitally constructed PDF (not a scan) with **65 fillable fields** — an unusually high count indicating comprehensive interactive coverage. Patients can complete every field on-screen without printing. The form spans 2 pages with a logical layout: patient demographics → record type selection → facility selection → sensitive information initials → recipient details → delivery method (page 1), then legal disclosures and signatures (page 2).

Record type options are granular (13 categories plus "Other"), and the form includes an "Entire Record" checkbox — an option absent from the older form-1. Delivery methods include email, fax, mail (with CD/USB options), and in-person pick-up. The multi-facility checkboxes let patients specify which AMHS hospital(s) to release from.

The main weakness is page 2: a dense wall of legal text covering revocation rights, HIV/AIDS protections, re-disclosure warnings, and 42 CFR Part 2 — all in small print with no headings, bullets, or visual hierarchy. The language is written at a college reading level. The footer on both pages contains a typo ("Dislcose" instead of "Disclose").

## Barriers

**Fee concern**: Both forms state a **$0.75/page copy fee** (phrased as "$0.75 cents per page" — a formatting error). The fee is waived for physician-to-physician transfers but not explicitly waived for patient self-access. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, per-page fees are generally impermissible; only reasonable cost-based fees are allowed. This is the most significant compliance concern.

**No witness required**: The newer system-wide form (form-2) removed the witness signature line that appeared on the legacy form-1 — a clear improvement.

**No notarization or in-person requirement**: Patients can submit by fax, email, or mail, satisfying the electronic submission baseline.

**No response time stated**: Neither form commits to a turnaround timeline.

## Notable Strengths

- **65 fillable fields** on the primary form — one of the most digitally complete ROI forms encountered
- **MyChart portal alternative** mentioned directly on the form
- **Granular record type and sensitive-information controls** with separate initials for HIV, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing
- **Multi-facility coverage** — a single form for all four AMHS hospitals reduces confusion

## Overall Assessment

Saratoga Hospital, via the Albany Med Health System, provides a technically polished and easily findable authorization form with excellent fillable-field coverage and a MyChart alternative. However, the experience is undermined by the complete absence of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must navigate a third-party release framework to exercise their individual access rights. The $0.75/page fee applied without distinguishing patient access from third-party release is a compliance concern. The form is a solid B-level document in terms of technical quality, but the lack of patient-centeredness and fee ambiguity hold back the overall score.

# Guthrie Corning Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Guthrie Corning Hospital is a community hospital in Corning, NY, operating within the Guthrie Clinic regional health system. All medical records forms are published at the system level by Guthrie Clinic and apply uniformly across its facilities (Corning, Troy, Cortland, Robert Packer, and Towanda Campus). Three documents were found: a general-purpose ROI authorization form (form-1), a family/friends access authorization (form-2), and a companion instruction sheet with fees and contact information (form-3).

## Best Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1**, the "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form — it serves all release purposes (provider-to-provider, legal, insurance, personal use) rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient must select "Personal Use" from a list of purpose options alongside "Legal," "Insurance," and "Lay Caregiver." The form does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508. Form-2 (family access) is irrelevant for patient self-access. Form-3 (instructions) supplements form-1 with submission details and fees.

The instruction sheet mentions that "Continuation of care requests may also be completed thru your individual eGuthrie/MyChart account," hinting at a patient portal pathway, but no detail is provided and this does not appear to cover general patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were **easy to find**. A basic web search immediately returned the PDF, and the Guthrie website's medical records page (guthrie.org/medical-records) serves as a well-organized hub. No bot blocking, JavaScript barriers, or login was required. All three documents were directly downloadable.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF**. It has zero interactive fields — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. Despite being digitally authored (not a scan), it was designed as a print-and-fill document with blank lines and empty checkbox squares rather than interactive elements. The form uses 9 fonts and has a dense layout that packs patient demographics, facility selection, record type checkboxes, format options, recipient information, purpose, rights statements, sensitive information opt-outs, and signature into one page. This compression keeps the form brief but makes it visually crowded.

The form's organization is logical: numbered sections flow from facility selection through record types, format, recipient, purpose, rights, expiration, and sensitive information. Language is moderately legalistic — phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" use distancing third-person framing. The instruction to "Read Entire Document Before Signing" is helpful but insufficient as the only guidance on the form itself.

Notable content features include three format options (Paper Copy, Electronic CD/DVD, Electronic On-Line) and granular record type selection (discharge summary, H&P, operative report, radiology by modality, etc.), giving patients meaningful control.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees** are transparent: the companion instruction sheet states a $6.50 flat rate for personal-use electronic records (HIPAA-compliant) and explicitly notes no charge for provider-to-provider transfers. This fee transparency, while not on the form itself, is better than most organizations.

**Submission** is available by mail, fax, or in-person — fax provides an adequate electronic submission channel. No online or email submission is available.

**No notarization** is required. The form does request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary and may deter privacy-conscious patients. The sensitive information default is opt-out (drug/alcohol, HIV, mental health records are released unless the patient checks boxes to exclude them), which is less protective than an opt-in approach. Genetic information is mentioned with no opt-out at all.

Corning Hospital patients face a geographic nuance: the instruction sheet notes "No onsite support" for Corning, directing patients to contact Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA, and mail forms to that address. This could be disorienting for local patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Excellent findability with a well-organized central medical records page
- Single-page form keeps burden low
- Clear fee transparency with HIPAA-compliant pricing
- Granular record type and format selection including electronic options
- System-wide forms eliminate confusion across facilities

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable/interactive fields despite being a digitally-created PDF
- Generic authorization form with no dedicated patient access pathway
- No reference to patient's right of access under HIPAA
- Sensitive information defaults to release (opt-out rather than opt-in)
- Critical information (fees, submission addresses, fax numbers) split across a separate document
- No onsite medical records support at Corning Hospital itself

## Overall Assessment

Guthrie Corning Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find, the fee structure is transparent and compliant, and the single-page format keeps patient burden manageable. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization approach that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, and the reliance on a print-handwrite-fax workflow place it squarely in the middle tier of organizations studied. The process works, but it was not designed with the patient as the primary user.

# West Tennessee Healthcare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

West Tennessee Healthcare (Jackson, TN) is a government-owned regional health system that demonstrates an above-average approach to patient record access by maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** (form-3) separate from its third-party release authorization (form-2) and an older clinic-level release form (form-1). The organization also offers an online request portal via ScanSTAT and publishes Spanish-language versions of its key forms. However, the forms themselves are not fillable PDFs, and some legacy legal language undermines the patient-centered intent.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all linked from a clearly labeled medical records page at wth.org/request-medical-records/:

- **Form-3 (primary)**: "Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — explicitly subtitled "To be used when patient wants to access their own medical record or allow a personal representative to do so." This is the most relevant form for patient self-access. It offers five delivery methods: paper, fax, CD/DVD, portal, and email (encrypted or unencrypted). Two pages, ~3,300 characters.
- **Form-2**: "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" — a third-party release authorization. One page, similar structure but without the portal delivery option.
- **Form-1**: "Medical Release Authorization" — an older (2019) form specific to the West Tennessee Medical Group Clinics. Functions as a general release for discussing care with designated individuals.

Additionally, the medical records page links to a **ScanSTAT online request portal** for hospital records, providing a fully digital alternative pathway. Spanish versions of forms 2 and 3 are also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

West Tennessee Healthcare clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release — a practice that relatively few organizations follow. Form-3 uses "request" language (appropriate for HIPAA § 164.524) rather than "authorization" language, and includes a portal delivery shortcut ("If choosing portal, please proceed to signature line. No other action needed"). The medical records webpage provides context to help patients choose the correct form. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The layout is logical — flowing from identification to delivery method to record selection to legal terms to signature — but relies on underscored blank lines and an initials-based record type selection system (15 categories). The language is moderately accessible in the patient-facing sections but becomes denser in the five legal "I understand" statements. No section headers divide the form; the structure relies on spatial layout and field labels. At two pages, the length is proportionate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search returned direct PDF links, and the medical records page is clearly labeled and well-organized. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The page provides good context about when to use each form.

## Barriers and Concerns

Two compliance issues stand out on form-3:

1. **Liability waiver**: "The facility is hereby released from any liability and the undersigned will hold the facility harmless for complying with this request." Requiring patients to waive liability to exercise their Right of Access is problematic under HIPAA.
2. **90-day expiration on an access request**: This language was carried over from the authorization form and is conceptually inappropriate — a patient access request is a one-time action, not an ongoing authorization that needs to expire.

Additional minor concerns include the driver's license requirement for non-in-person requests, SSN collection (last 4 digits), no fee disclosure, and no explicit statement of patient rights or response timeframe. The form also omits the non-conditioning statement that appears on form-2.

## Bright Spots

- **Dedicated patient access form** with clear purpose statement
- **ScanSTAT online portal** as an alternative digital pathway
- **Spanish-language versions** of both key forms
- **Multiple delivery options** including portal and encrypted email with risk disclosure
- **Easy findability** from a well-organized medical records page

## Overall Assessment

West Tennessee Healthcare shows genuine patient-centered intent by distinguishing patient access from third-party release and offering multiple pathways including an online portal. The organization loses points for non-fillable PDFs, legacy legal language (liability waiver, expiration clause), and missing rights/fee information. The structural approach is strong, but the execution — particularly the form document quality and some compliance details — keeps this from being a top-tier example. Overall, a solid B-level performance that could reach A-level with fillable fields and cleaned-up legal language.

# NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) provides a well-organized, multi-channel records request system anchored by a system-wide "Tripartite" HIPAA authorization form shared across NYP, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medicine. Three documents were retrieved: the primary Tripartite ROI form (form-1), a patient-facing FAQ (form-2), and an older Lawrence campus-specific variant (form-3). The organization directs patients primarily to a Verisma online portal, with MyChart and paper form submission as alternatives.

## Access Pathway & Differentiation

NYP offers genuine differentiation at the pathway level: the medical records page provides separate Verisma portal links for Patient, Patient Representative, and Attorney workflows. This is a meaningful distinction that helps patients identify their correct route. However, the underlying authorization framework remains generic — the paper form (form-1) is a single HIPAA authorization used for all disclosure types, with "Patient Request" as one of seven checkboxes alongside Life Insurance, Legal Purposes, and Worker's Comp. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish the legal framework for patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization section states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records," which is accurate for third-party releases but misleading for patient access requests, where HIPAA requires only a written request, not a signed authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records) leads to a well-organized page. Web searches readily surface both the medical records page and direct PDF links. The form is hosted on a digital asset management platform (nyp.widen.net), which initially served an HTML viewer rather than the raw PDF, requiring some effort to extract the actual download URL. This is a minor friction point for an otherwise easy retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is technically excellent. It is a born-digital, fully interactive PDF with 103 fillable fields — one of the most technically capable ROI forms in this study. The 2-page form follows a logical flow through patient demographics, recipient information, disclosing entity selection (covering all 11 NYP campuses plus outpatient groups), granular record-type checkboxes (16+ options including "Entire Medical Record"), sensitive information authorization (compliant with New York state law for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing), six delivery methods, and a numbered authorization section. The layout is clean with bold section headers, though the density of content on two pages results in small text in places. The authorization language includes some compound legalese that is difficult to parse, but the overall organization is strong.

The form is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese — a notable accommodation for New York City's diverse population.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on the primary form (though the older Lawrence form-3 includes a "Witness or Notary" line). The Verisma portal requires two forms of photo ID, which exceeds typical HIPAA identity verification expectations and may exclude patients without two scannable photo IDs. The form mandates a date-of-service range, stating "records will not be released unless Date of Service section is complete" — a potential barrier for patients seeking their complete longitudinal record. Fees are described as "reasonable fees to recover costs," tracking HIPAA's statutory language without specifying amounts. No response time commitment appears on the form or FAQ.

## Notable Strengths

NYP's system stands out for its dedicated phone line (646-NYP-4ROI, M-F 8am-6pm), multilingual form availability, comprehensive FAQ document with transparent MyChart record-type listings, and the sheer technical quality of the fillable PDF. The six delivery options — paper, fax, email, CD, flash drive, and patient portal (at no cost) — give patients meaningful choice.

## Overall Assessment

NYP delivers a technically strong, well-organized records request experience with good findability and multiple access channels. The main weakness is the lack of a truly patient-access-specific pathway: despite portal-level differentiation, the underlying form treats patient self-access as one use case among many without acknowledging the distinct legal rights involved. The two-photo-ID portal requirement and mandatory date-of-service range create unnecessary friction. Overall, this is a solid B-level experience — above average in technical execution but falling short of patient-centered design.

# The Baton Rouge Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

The Baton Rouge Clinic maintains three distinct medical records forms on a well-organized "Downloadable Forms" page: (1) an outbound release authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information FROM The Baton Rouge Clinic"), (2) an inbound transfer authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information TO The Baton Rouge Clinic"), and (3) a "Right of Access Form" citing HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 164.524. This three-form strategy shows unusual thoughtfulness — the clinic has differentiated between outbound third-party release, inbound records transfer, and patient-directed access, which is more than most organizations offer.

## Patient Self-Access Pathway

The Right of Access form (form-3) is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. At just one page and ~1,300 characters, it is admirably concise compared to the two-page authorization forms. It explicitly cites HIPAA Right of Access authority and offers a choice between electronic and hard copy delivery — a genuine bright spot that many organizations lack.

However, the form has a meaningful design flaw: it is framed entirely as a designee authorization, directing providers to disclose records "to: Name: ___." There is no clear option for a patient to request records for themselves; a patient wanting their own records would need to awkwardly write their own name in the recipient field. The form that most directly invokes the Right of Access isn't actually designed for the most common Right of Access use case — patient self-request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search immediately returned direct PDF links to the authorization forms. All three forms were hosted on a well-organized downloadable forms page at `batonrougeclinic.com/patient-information/downloadable-forms/` with no login, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering required. The one findability gap: the Right of Access form (form-3) was not surfaced by the initial web search and was only discovered by browsing the forms page directly. A patient searching specifically for "how to request my records" might land on the third-party release form instead.

## Form Document Quality

All three forms are flat PDFs with zero fillable fields, despite having clean text layers (not scans). Every form requires printing and hand-filling — a significant accessibility gap, particularly ironic for form-3, which explicitly offers electronic record delivery while requiring a paper submission process. Form-3 has a clean, simple layout with logical flow (patient name → designee → scope → format → duration → signature). The language is relatively plain and accessible. Form-1 uses an asterisk system to mark required fields, which is helpful, though it also requires a Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection burden that form-3 wisely avoids.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. None of the forms disclose fees or state response times. Form-1 includes a hold-harmless clause that goes beyond HIPAA requirements, though form-3 omits this — a more patient-friendly approach. Submission methods are poorly documented: form-1 provides a medical records email (medrecords@brclinic.com) and phone number for questions and urgent requests, but no form explicitly states how to submit the completed document. No fax number is provided. The mailing address appears in footers. A patient completing form-3 has no guidance on where or how to send it.

## Overall Assessment

The Baton Rouge Clinic demonstrates above-average organizational thinking about patient access — the three-form strategy and HIPAA Right of Access citation reflect genuine awareness of different use cases. The Right of Access form's conciseness and electronic delivery option are bright spots. However, the execution falls short in key areas: all forms lack fillable fields, submission pathways are unclear, and the Right of Access form's designee-only framing creates a confusing gap for patients seeking their own records. The clinic has the right structure but needs better implementation — fillable fields, explicit submission instructions, and a self-access option on the Right of Access form would substantially improve the patient experience.

# Adena Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Adena Regional Medical Center, a nonprofit community hospital in Chillicothe, Ohio and part of the Adena Health System, provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests. The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — patients requesting their own records must navigate the same form designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. Three documents were found on the organization's medical records request page: two versions of the same ROI authorization form (one current, one outdated) and a fee schedule.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf** (CLI.1777, Rev. 10/25), a one-page "Authorization: Release of Information Form" that serves as the current version. An older version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/02/2020) is also linked from the same page under "Option 3 – By Mail or Fax," creating confusion about which form to use. The fee schedule (form-3.pdf) is a supplementary document published as an image-only scan with no text layer.

Submission is available by mail or fax. Form-2 explicitly lists the fax number (740-779-7769) and mailing address; form-1 does not include a fax number, an oversight that may force patients to hunt for contact information. No online portal submission for records requests was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Adena does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both form versions use a three-way checkbox ("Obtain records from / Release records to / Exchange verbal information with") oriented toward third-party disclosure flows. A patient requesting their own records would need to check "Release records to" and enter their own name as recipient — a non-obvious workflow. The form includes "Personal" as a purpose-of-disclosure option, which is a helpful signal, but there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or any language distinguishing patient-access requests from third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search for the medical records release form surfaced the dedicated medical records request page at `/patients-and-visitors/patient-rights/medical-records-request` on the first attempt. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. All PDFs were directly downloadable. The page is logically located under "Patient Rights," reachable in approximately three clicks from the homepage.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created, text-based PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand (or use a third-party PDF annotation tool). The form fits on a single page, which is commendable for brevity, but the layout is cramped as a result. Sections flow logically (demographics → direction → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → rights → signature), though there are no formal section headers. The record type selection is comprehensive, offering 14 options including an "Abstract" bundle. Language is moderately legalistic, particularly in the "I understand the following" rights section. An "Administrative Use Only – Driver's license number" field at the very top may confuse patients into thinking it's required.

A notable positive: the form explicitly offers electronic delivery of records via email, putting it ahead of many peers. However, no encryption or secure delivery mechanism is mentioned.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is a **witness signature requirement** — HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient authorizations, and a patient filling out the form at home would need to find a witness, potentially discouraging submission. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which is common but not required by HIPAA and raises data security concerns.

Fee language is problematic: the form states charges "WILL" apply "in accordance with Ohio Law" without distinguishing patient-access requests (subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee cap) from third-party releases (subject to potentially higher state rates). The fee schedule is published proactively on the medical records page — a positive practice — but as an image-only scan it is inaccessible to screen readers, translation tools, and text search.

The psychotherapy notes checkbox requires "approval by psychotherapist," which is appropriate for third-party release but would constitute an impermissible barrier if applied to patient self-access requests.

## Overall Assessment

Adena Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and concise, with some thoughtful features like electronic delivery and comprehensive record type options. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party-oriented design, the witness signature requirement, and ambiguous fee language collectively create a process that works for patients who are persistent but was clearly not designed with patient self-access as a priority. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate but with meaningful room for improvement in both form design and patient-centeredness.

# University of Mississippi Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

UMMC provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (Form #1862) in two language versions. Form-1 is a Spanish-language version (Rev. 05/2025) retrieved from the Wayback Machine, and form-2 is an older English-language version (Rev. 04/2018) obtained from a third-party caching site (pdf4pro.com). Both are one-page PDFs covering all UMMC locations. No dedicated patient access form, online portal, or web-based request wizard was identified. No separate fee schedule or patient rights document was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UMMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to third parties — the "Release to" field and purpose options like Legal/Attorney, Insurance, and Workers' Compensation reflect a third-party orientation. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal" as the purpose and enter their own contact information in the "Release to" field, which is a confusing and unintuitive workflow. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or informs patients of their affirmative right to access their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **extremely difficult**. The English PDF link on UMMC's website returns HTTP 404, and an older compliance-page URL is also broken. Five different retrieval strategies were attempted: direct web search, curl (failed due to DNS), Wayback Machine, browser-based archive navigation, and finally a third-party cache. The Spanish version was the only form still live at its canonical URL. The English form was only available via pdf4pro.com — a source no typical patient would find. This represents a critical findability failure for a major teaching hospital: a patient visiting the UMMC website today and clicking the Release Form link reaches a dead end.

## Form Document Quality

Using the **high-watermark principle**, the Spanish form (form-1) is the better document: it has 70 fillable/interactive fields, a native text layer, and was clearly designed as a digital-first PDF. The English form (form-2) has zero fillable fields and requires printing and handwriting. Both forms share identical structure: location selection → patient info → release-to info → purpose checkboxes → 14 record-type checkboxes → sensitive information initials → patient rights paragraph → signature block with witness. The layout is logically organized but cramped, fitting everything onto a single page at the cost of readability. The Patient Rights section is a dense, unbroken paragraph of legal text with no bullet points or visual hierarchy. Three delivery formats are offered — Paper, Electronic, and "View Access as scheduled" — but none are defined, and critically, **no submission instructions appear on either form** (no fax number, no mailing address for initial submission, no email, no portal link).

## Barriers

- **Witness signature required**: Both forms mandate a witness, which HIPAA does not require. This is a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **SSN collection**: Both forms request the patient's full Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates identity theft risk.
- **Incomplete forms rejected**: The header warns that incomplete forms will not be accepted, but does not clarify which fields are mandatory.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions fees, costs, or the patient's right to cost-based pricing.
- **No submission instructions**: A patient completing the form has no way to know where to send it.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering Spanish and English versions is a genuine accessibility strength, especially for Mississippi's growing Spanish-speaking population.
- **Fillable PDF (Spanish version)**: 70 interactive fields allow digital completion.
- **Electronic delivery option**: The form explicitly offers "Electronic" as a delivery format.
- **Granular record selection**: 14 specific record categories with a clarification that "Entire Medical Record" does not include images — a helpful transparency measure.
- **"Personal" purpose option**: Including this among pre-printed options legitimizes patient self-access.

## Overall Assessment

UMMC provides a generic, moderately well-designed authorization form that serves patients as an afterthought rather than a primary audience. The critical findability failure — a broken English PDF link on the organization's own website — is the most acute problem: a patient cannot currently obtain the form from UMMC online. The Spanish version survives but would not serve most English-speaking patients. The witness requirement and SSN collection add unnecessary friction. The absence of submission instructions is a significant gap. While the Spanish form's fillable fields and bilingual availability are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects an organization that has not prioritized patient self-access as a distinct use case.

# Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital is part of **Cottage Health**, a regional nonprofit system serving the Santa Barbara/Goleta area of California. The hospital does not maintain its own ROI forms; instead, it uses Cottage Health's system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (Form NS1405). Three documents were retrieved: the current English form (Aug 2025), a complete Spanish translation (Form NS1406, Aug 2025), and a superseded English version (Jun 2025). Cottage Health also offers an online electronic request pathway via Swellbox, linked from the same medical records page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

The primary form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of health information disclosure — to providers, insurers, attorneys, and the patient themselves. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. However, Section C includes a clear **"Patient (self)" checkbox**, so a patient requesting their own records can use the form without pretending to be a third party. The form's title ("Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information"), structure (redisclosure restrictions, recipient relationship fields), and framing are clearly built around the third-party release paradigm. A self-requesting patient must navigate sections that don't apply to them — recipient relationship, redisclosure restrictions — and there is no streamlined "I just want my own records" pathway on the PDF itself.

The **Swellbox online wizard** (linked from the medical records page) provides an alternative digital pathway that may be more patient-centric, though it was not evaluated in detail.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The medical records page sits at a clear navigation path (Home > Patients & Visitors > Accessing Your Medical Records) and is well-organized. The main friction was technical: the primary website URLs are protected by Akamai CDN, which blocks programmatic downloads. Azure Blob Storage mirror URLs worked without issue. The website also hosted both June and August 2025 versions simultaneously, creating minor version-confusion risk. The older version remains live at its original URL with no "outdated" notice.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a **2-page, digitally-authored PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. Despite this, it has **zero fillable/interactive form fields**. All checkboxes and text blanks are static visual elements. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and then scan or photograph it for electronic submission. This contradicts the form's own statement that "VALID ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES WILL BE ACCEPTED" — the form signals digital readiness but doesn't deliver it.

The layout is well-organized with **nine lettered sections (A–I)**, each with clear headings, following a logical flow: patient info → record scope → recipient → delivery method → expiration → rights → restrictions → cost → signature. The language is **mostly plain**, with an accessible opening statement about the right to refuse. Some passages lean toward legalese (redisclosure restrictions in Section G). At approximately 15–18 fields, the scope is reasonable for the content covered.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Submission methods** are genuinely flexible: email (medicalrecords@sbch.org), fax, and mail are all accepted. No in-person requirement exists. Electronic signatures are explicitly accepted. **No notarization** is required.

**Fees** are vaguely disclosed: "There may be a fee for copies of medical records. You will be notified in advance." No fee schedule or amount is provided, and the waiver for provider-to-provider transfers could imply that patient self-requests do incur fees. The form commits to a **15-day turnaround**, faster than HIPAA's 30-day requirement.

One **red flag**: the opening warning that "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" could function as a barrier, potentially giving the organization grounds to reject incomplete but actionable requests. HIPAA does not permit denying access based on incomplete non-essential fields.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version**: A complete, professionally translated form (NS1406) — not a summary — demonstrating genuine linguistic accessibility for the Goleta/Santa Barbara community.
- **MyChart delivery option**: Patients can receive records directly through the patient portal, a modern approach many organizations lack.
- **Swellbox online alternative**: A fully digital request pathway exists alongside the PDF, giving patients a choice.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Email, fax, and mail all accepted — no physical visit required.
- **California sensitive-category handling**: Appropriate opt-in checkboxes for Mental Health, Chemical Dependency, HIV, and Reproductive Healthcare with state law citations.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Health provides a **competent but not exemplary** patient access experience. The system earns credit for offering multiple pathways (PDF, Swellbox portal, email/fax submission), a Spanish translation, and MyChart delivery. However, the core form is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF undermines the digital workflow the system otherwise supports. The vague fee language and "invalidation" warning are minor compliance concerns. A patient can successfully request their own records through this system without undue hardship, but the process could be meaningfully improved with a patient-specific form and interactive PDF fields.

**Grade: B** — Good overall with room for improvement in patient-centeredness and technical accessibility of the PDF form.

# Lincoln Hospital (Davenport, WA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lincoln Hospital, a small government-owned critical access hospital in rural eastern Washington, publishes two ROI forms on its Health Records page: a **clinics version** (form-1.pdf) for records held at North Basin Medical Clinics and a **hospital version** (form-2.pdf) for hospital records. Both are titled "Authorization for Release of Health Care Information and Records" and share nearly identical structure and legal boilerplate. The forms are reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Health Records), making them reasonably easy to find.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information — the page 1 structure asks patients to specify a recipient for records, with fields for the recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. Page 2 of each form includes an "ACCESS REQUEST" section that acknowledges the patient's right to inspect and obtain copies of their own records, making the forms technically dual-purpose. However, a patient requesting their own records receives no clear guidance on how to fill out the third-party-oriented page 1 — should they list themselves as the recipient? The form doesn't say. The "At the request of the Patient" purpose checkbox and "Given to Patient" delivery option exist but are not prominently featured as a distinct pathway.

## Form Document Quality

The hospital form (form-2.pdf) is the technically superior document: it has a full text layer (7,364 characters extractable), making it screen-reader accessible and searchable. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. The clinics form (form-1.pdf) is worse: a scanned image of a paper document with no extractable text whatsoever, rendering it completely inaccessible to assistive technology.

Both forms are 2 pages and reasonably organized. Page 1 uses labeled sections (Types of Information, Purpose, Revocation, Re-Disclosure, No Conditions, Time Frame, Consent of Minor) with clear visual hierarchy. The language mixes plain English with necessary legal terminology; sections like the "No Conditions" statement are clear, while the sensitive-information preamble is dense legalese. The hospital form's "OFFICE USE" section appears near patient-facing fields without clear labeling, potentially confusing patients about what they need to fill out.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were found through web search and confirmed on the hospital website. The Health Records page returned a 403 error to automated fetch tools (likely bot blocking), requiring browser access, but loaded normally in a standard browser. One alternate URL for the clinics form returned HTTP 400, suggesting stale links. Overall findability was good — a patient navigating the website would locate these forms without difficulty.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant concern is the **fee structure**. The clinics form cites Washington's WAC 246-08-400 fee schedule ($26.00 search/base fee, $1.17/page for first 30 pages, $0.88/page thereafter plus tax) — fees designed for third-party record duplication that likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests. Worse, this fee schedule references dates of September 2017 through June 2019, making it nearly seven years expired. The hospital form takes a different approach: its fee field reads "$______ per page" with the amount left blank — unhelpful for patients trying to anticipate costs.

The clinics form requires patients to attach a copy of photo identification, which goes beyond HIPAA requirements and creates an additional burden. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both forms correctly state a 30-day response time (60 days for off-site records) with one possible 30-day extension, aligning with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

The clinics form offers electronic delivery options — "MyChart Secure Patient Portal, CD, USB Flash Drive (provided by patient)" — a notably progressive feature for a small rural critical access hospital. The "Most recent two (2) years" date range shortcut with specific clinical examples (colonoscopy, mammogram, DEXA, diabetic exams) is patient-friendly. Both forms include an explicit "No Conditions" statement and detailed minor consent provisions aligned with Washington State law.

## Overall Assessment

Lincoln Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and include some thoughtful patient-facing features (electronic delivery options, clinical shortcuts), but fundamental issues undermine the experience: no fillable fields on either form, a generic third-party authorization structure that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, potentially excessive fees, and one form that is an image-only scan. The organization deserves credit for acknowledging patient access rights on page 2 of each form but falls short of providing a clear, patient-centric access pathway.

# Boulder Medical Center — Organization Synthesis

## Available Pathways

Boulder Medical Center (BMC) presents patients with three record-request pathways, clearly laid out on their [Medical Records department page](https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/departments/medical-records/): (1) a Swellbox online portal for records created before September 9, 2024; (2) the MyChart "Sharing Hub" for records after that date; and (3) a downloadable PDF authorization form. The PDF form (`form-1.pdf`) was the only traditional document available for download and is the focus of this evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

BMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single PDF form — titled "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Patient Information" — is a generic ROI authorization designed to handle bidirectional record transfers between entities. While the phrase "I am requesting my records" appears, the form's structure treats the patient as a routing intermediary rather than the information recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no language explaining patient-specific rights beyond the standard no-conditioning clause. The online portals (Swellbox and MyChart) may provide a more patient-centric experience, but neither was evaluated as a downloadable form document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search led directly to the Medical Records page, where the PDF is clearly linked under "Option 2." No bot-blocking, JavaScript rendering, or deep navigation was required. The page helpfully contextualizes the PDF as one of three options, giving patients a clear choice. This is a strong findability result.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a single-page, digitally-created document — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print and handwrite. The layout follows a logical flow (demographics → delivery method → record types → entity information → authorization → signatures), but the authorization section is a dense block of nine "I understand" statements with no visual separation. The form includes some genuinely helpful plain-language disclosures ("once this information is disclosed by BMC, it will no longer be protected by BMC"), though the dual-direction design ("from the Entity... to be mailed to ___ at BMC" vs. "to be sent to Entity listed below") is confusing for a patient requesting their own records for personal use. Record type options are limited to five categories with no "all records" checkbox.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form states a 10-business-day processing time, well within HIPAA's 30-day window. It correctly includes a no-conditioning clause and a 180-day expiration. However, the fee disclosure is vague ("there may be a cost to copy the records") with no schedule or estimate. Most concerning is the email restriction: "Due to HIPAA regulations regarding security of electronic transmissions, we cannot email records to anyone but your personal email." This mischaracterizes HIPAA, which explicitly grants patients the right to direct records to a third party. The designated agent language is also narrowly scoped, covering only incapacitated patients rather than parents of minors or POA holders. Submission can be done by fax (303-449-9380) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple pathways**: The website clearly presents three options (Swellbox, MyChart, PDF), giving patients choices based on their record dates and preferences.
- **Single-page conciseness**: The form avoids the multi-page burden common at other organizations.
- **Plain-language disclosures**: Several authorization statements are unusually clear and honest.
- **Easy findability**: The form is prominently linked from a well-organized Medical Records page.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** despite being a digitally-created PDF — a missed opportunity.
- **No patient access differentiation**: The form treats all requests identically regardless of who is requesting and why.
- **Misleading HIPAA email restriction**: Incorrectly frames a policy choice as a legal requirement.
- **Stale form**: Revision date January 2019, uploaded November 2020, but a major system transition occurred in September 2024.

## Overall Assessment

Boulder Medical Center earns credit for making its form easy to find and for offering multiple request pathways including online portals. However, the PDF form itself is a generic, non-fillable ROI authorization that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The misleading email restriction and vague fee disclosure are compliance concerns. A patient can complete the process via fax or mail submission without visiting in person, which meets the baseline, but the lack of fillable fields and the form's dual-direction confusion reduce usability. The organization is adequate but not patient-centered in its PDF-based pathway.

# El Centro de Corazón — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

El Centro de Corazón is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Houston, Texas. It offers a single downloadable PDF form for health information disclosure — a bilingual (English/Spanish) "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information." This form is the only pathway available for patients seeking their own medical records, and it is oriented entirely toward third-party release of information rather than patient self-access.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page authorization for disclosure hosted on the organization's WordPress site. Page 1 is in English, page 2 is a Spanish translation. No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified. The form's fax number (713-926-9105) is printed on the document, suggesting fax is an accepted submission method, though this is not explicitly stated as a submission instruction. No email, portal, or other electronic submission options are mentioned.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

El Centro de Corazón does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses a "provide to / receive from (circle one)" structure that presumes records flow between El Centro and another entity. There is no "send records to me, the patient" option. Among the nine reason-for-disclosure checkboxes (Continuing of Care, Financial Insurance Verification, Legal Proceedings, etc.), none corresponds to "personal/patient request." A patient wanting their own records must use the "Other (Specify)" write-in, which is unintuitive and signals that patient self-access was not a design consideration.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), does not include any patient rights language, and does not ask how the patient would like to receive their records (mail, electronic, in-person pickup). This is a generic HIPAA authorization form pressed into service for all disclosure scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned a direct link to the PDF on El Centro's WordPress site. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication was encountered. The URL structure (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/...`) is a standard WordPress media path — functional but not linked from a clearly labeled "Medical Records" or "Patient Resources" page. The form appears to date from August 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive form fields). It must be printed and completed by hand — the design uses underscore-line blanks and a "circle one" instruction that are hallmarks of print-era forms. The text layer is present (not a scan), so the content is readable and searchable, but there is no digital-first workflow available.

**Field count** is modest: patient name, DOB, phone number, the other party's information, reason checkboxes, information-type checkboxes, a sensitive-information acknowledgment, and signature/date fields — roughly 12–15 fields per language. At one page per language, the form is compact and not overwhelming.

**Layout** is functional but dense. Section headers are minimal; the form flows as a single block of content. Language is relatively plain, though legal constructs appear ("I hereby authorize"). A grammatical error exists in both versions regarding re-disclosure language.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Witness signature line**: Present on both English and Spanish versions. HIPAA does not require a witness for authorization forms. While the line appears optional (no mandatory language), its presence may lead staff to enforce it as required, creating an unnecessary barrier.
- **Fee disclosure**: Vague — "I understand that I may be charged for the copies of health records I have requested" — with no specifics about amounts, HIPAA cost-based limits, or dispute processes.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization defaults to 90 days, which is reasonable for third-party disclosures but irrelevant for patient access requests (which must be fulfilled within 30 days).
- **No delivery format options**: The form does not ask how the patient wants to receive records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual (English/Spanish)**: Providing a full Spanish translation on the same document is a meaningful accessibility feature for an FQHC serving Houston's predominantly Spanish-speaking communities. This is uncommon and commendable.
- **Compact design**: One page per language avoids the multi-page complexity that discourages completion.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient self-access pathway**: The form's entire structure is oriented toward third-party disclosure. A patient exercising their Right of Access is a second-class user.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive fields; purely a print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Checkbox mismatch**: The Spanish version omits "Billing Records" as a checkbox option, creating a translation inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

El Centro de Corazón provides a findable, compact, bilingual form — but it is a generic third-party authorization that does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The non-fillable format, lack of patient rights language, ambiguous witness requirement, and vague fee disclosure all contribute to a below-average patient experience. The bilingual design is a genuine bright spot that partially offsets the form's structural shortcomings.

# Synthesis: Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center

## Overview

Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Far Rockaway, NY. Three documents were found on the organization's website: the primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a bilingual patient exit survey (form-2), and a general HIPAA consent/NPP acknowledgment form (form-3). Only form-1 functions as an actual records request authorization.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Addabbo does not offer a pathway designed specifically for patient self-access. The sole records request mechanism is **OCA Official Form No. 960**, a New York State standard "Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA." This is a general-purpose third-party authorization form — originally designed for litigation — that patients must repurpose when requesting their own records. The form includes "At request of individual" as one checkbox among several reasons for release, but it does not distinguish between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party seeking records. The instruction page explicitly states the form was designed for "release of health information needed for litigation in New York State courts" and "can, however, be used more broadly."

The form does not reference the patient's right to receive their own records, does not offer format or delivery options (electronic, paper, CD), and does not mention a patient portal. It collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient self-access and creates privacy risk.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. The organization's website has a dedicated Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`) accessible through the "For Patients" navigation menu. However, the forms are hosted on a third-party platform (Practice Builders / `pbformsonline.com`) via a JavaScript-based PDF viewer, requiring browser DevTools inspection to obtain the actual PDF download URL. A patient could fill the form within the embedded viewer, but downloading for offline completion requires technical sophistication.

A potential confusion point: the Patient Forms page labels form-3 as "HIPAA Consent to Release Information," which could mislead patients into downloading a registration consent form instead of the actual ROI authorization.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **fillable PDF** with 25 interactive fields, though none have accessible name attributes (degrading screen reader usability). The form is 2 pages — one page of authorization content and one page of litigation-context instructions. This is appropriately concise.

The form's structure front-loads six numbered legal disclosures (HIV redisclosure warnings, revocation rights, voluntariness) before any patient-fillable fields, creating a dense, legalistic opening. The language throughout is complex — written for attorneys, not patients. Item 6's all-caps restriction on discussing health information "WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SPECIFIED IN ITEM 9(b)" is confusing in a non-litigation context.

A notable bright spot: Addabbo added a **typed-signature acceptance clause**, allowing patients to complete and sign the form digitally without printing. This is a meaningful accommodation for remote submission. The form also provides a clear enumeration of what "entire medical record" includes and granular opt-in initialing for sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug treatment, mental health, HIV).

## Barriers

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number — unnecessary for patient self-access and a privacy risk.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. While this avoids imposing excessive fees, it also doesn't inform patients of their cost-limited rights.
- **No submission method specified on form**: The form itself does not indicate how to submit. The website context and Practice Builders platform provide some guidance, but submission via fax or in-person delivery appears to be expected.
- **Exit survey co-location**: The "We're Listening" exit survey (form-2) is posted alongside the ROI form on the Medical Records page, framing all records requests as patient transfers. If presented as a companion requirement, this could function as an implicit barrier. The survey contains pervasive Spanish translation errors.

## Bright Spots

- Typed-signature acceptance removes the print-sign-scan barrier
- Explicit enumeration of medical record contents gives patients clarity
- Granular sensitive-information opt-in via initialing
- Bilingual exit survey (despite translation quality issues) reflects community awareness
- Dedicated Medical Records page with direct link to the ROI form

## Overall Assessment

Addabbo provides a functional but imperfect pathway for patient records access. The organization relies on a state-standard litigation authorization form rather than creating a patient-centered access process. The form is fillable with typed-signature support — a meaningful digital accommodation — but the legalistic language, SSN collection, litigation framing, and lack of patient access rights language place the experience squarely in "adequate but not designed for you" territory. The retrieval experience is reasonable, though the third-party form hosting and confusingly labeled companion documents create unnecessary friction.

# TriStar Centennial Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

TriStar Centennial Medical Center is an HCA Healthcare–affiliated community hospital in Nashville, TN. Three documents were retrieved: the primary English-language HCA authorization form (form-1), a Spanish translation (form-3), and a separate form for Centennial Medical Group, an affiliated physician practice in Elkridge, MD (form-2). The hospital's own forms (form-1 and form-3) are the relevant documents for assessing this facility's patient access experience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for authorization/release form terms immediately surfaced the hospital's medical records page, which is clearly organized under For Patients → Medical Records. Both English and Spanish PDF download links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or portal login was required. The HCA Digital Asset Management URLs worked with a standard download. This is about as easy as form retrieval gets.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

TriStar Centennial does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary document (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of PHI" designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release. The "Purpose of disclosure" field lists "At the request of the individual" as the first option, with "Other 3rd party recipient" as the alternative — but both flow through the same form, same fields, and same process. Patients must navigate Section B (marketing/sale of PHI disclosures) even when it doesn't apply, and the form's recipient fields are oriented toward third-party recipients rather than a simple "send me my records" workflow.

That said, the medical records page also offers a **Swellbox online portal** for digital submission and the **MyHealthONE patient portal** for direct record access, providing alternative pathways that may offer a more patient-centric experience. The existence of these portal options partially compensates for the generic form design.

## Form Document Quality

The primary HCA form (form-1) is technically excellent. It is a **digitally native, single-page PDF with 52 fillable fields** — covering every input from patient demographics to 16+ record-type checkboxes to delivery preferences. This is unusually thorough; many organizations provide flat, non-fillable PDFs that require printing and handwriting. The file is lean (170 KB, no embedded images, 9 fonts), confirming it was designed as a digital artifact rather than scanned from paper.

The form offers **four delivery format options** — paper copy, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email — which is above average. It includes a forward-looking **USCDI Release Request** option for structured health data exchange, though this feature is aimed at provider-to-provider use and would confuse most patients.

Layout is organized into three labeled sections (A: core authorization, B: marketing/sale disclosures, C: signatures), which provides logical structure. However, packing this much content into a single page means tight spacing and modest font sizes. The language is a mix of functional form labels and legal disclosures — the patient rights statements use reasonably plain first-person language ("I understand that…"), but passages like the unencrypted email risk disclaimer are dense.

The **Spanish translation** (form-3) is a full parallel version with identical structure and 52 fillable fields — not a scan or afterthought. A few staff-facing elements (footer text, "ID verified by" field) remain in English, but the patient-facing content is fully translated.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no significant barriers**. No notarization or witness is required. The SSN field is explicitly marked optional. The 180-day default expiration is reasonable with options for custom dates. Psychotherapy notes are properly separated per HIPAA requirements. Fee language references a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts — appropriate, though it gives patients no cost visibility.

Submission options include **fax (844-481-0298) and mail**, plus the Swellbox portal for fully digital submission. A patient can complete and submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual fillable PDFs**: Both English and Spanish versions with 52 interactive fields each, directly linked from the same page
- **USCDI release option**: Rare acknowledgment of interoperability standards on an ROI form
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Four options including encrypted email
- **Portal alternatives**: Swellbox and MyHealthONE provide digital-first pathways beyond the PDF
- **10-day turnaround** (on the CMG form) and clear contact information

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: The generic authorization form doesn't distinguish individual access rights from third-party release
- **Default to paper delivery**: If the delivery section is left blank, the patient gets paper — an electronic default would be more patient-friendly
- **Dense single page**: The amount of content compressed onto one page may challenge patients with limited literacy or visual impairments
- **Minor grammatical error**: "I may see and obtain a copy the information" is missing "of"

## Overall Assessment

TriStar Centennial earns a **B grade**. The technical quality of its forms is strong — fillable fields, bilingual availability, multiple delivery options, and a clean digital PDF. Retrieval is effortless. Compliance posture is solid with no unnecessary barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway: a patient requesting their own records navigates the same authorization form as an insurer or attorney, with no differentiation in process, language, or workflow. The availability of portal alternatives (Swellbox, MyHealthONE) partially mitigates this, but the core PDF experience doesn't center the patient as an individual exercising their right of access.

# St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Phoenix, AZ, offers a notably differentiated approach to medical records access. The organization maintains separate forms for patient self-access (form-2.pdf) and third-party release (form-3.pdf), with its medical records webpage clearly distinguishing between the two pathways. This separation is a meaningful patient-centeredness achievement that many organizations fail to provide.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" (X-MR-4869, dated 02/22) — a 5-page dedicated patient access form linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" option. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
- **form-3.pdf**: A 2-page third-party authorization form (X-MR-4862, dated 03/13) — an image-only scan used for releasing records to physicians or other parties.
- **form-1.pdf**: A general Arizona Dignity Health authorization form found via web search but not linked from the St. Joseph's page. It references Mercy Gilbert Medical Center and appears to be from a different facility.

The medical records page also references an online Patient Center/Patient Portal as an alternative access channel (Section D of form-2).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating approximately 4–5 clicks through the Dignity Health website (Home → Arizona → St. Joseph's → Patients and Visitors → For Patients → Medical Records). The path is logical and well-structured, though it requires traversing the multi-facility health system hierarchy. The medical records page clearly separates patient self-request from third-party authorization — a helpful distinction that reduces confusion at the point of access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

St. Joseph's stands out for maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** that is clearly distinct from its third-party release authorization. Form-2 is explicitly titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and covers only patient self-access, while form-3 handles third-party disclosures. This organizational separation reflects genuine awareness of the difference between HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) and authorization for disclosure (§ 164.508).

However, the execution has some issues. The form's processing language states the hospital will "contact you with either denial or acceptance of the request" — framing patient access as discretionary rather than as a right that must be fulfilled within 30 days. Additionally, the employee verification block on page 4 (fields for "ID Presented" and staff verification) implies in-person presentation may be expected, even though email and fax submission are explicitly offered.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is digitally typeset with a clean text layer but contains **zero fillable form fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The form is organized into five lettered sections (A through E) with a logical progression: access type → delivery format → record types → patient portal → directing records to others. This structure is clear and well-conceived.

The form offers unusually comprehensive delivery options: USB drive, CD, secure email, unsecured email, and paper. Submission can be done via email (DignityHealth-AZ-ROI@DignityHealth.org) or fax (two numbers provided), eliminating the need for physical visits. Record type granularity is excellent, with 14+ specific categories plus a "Complete Health Record" option.

The main content design weaknesses are the routing complexity on page 1 — six different email addresses and three fax numbers for different departments, requiring patients to determine which contact handles their request — and the multi-state sensitive records sections (Arizona, California, and Nevada), which add confusion for patients at an Arizona facility. At 5 pages (4 patient-facing plus a facility-only denial page), the form is moderately long but justified by the breadth of options.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. Submission is available via email and fax, so no in-person visit is necessary. Fees are mentioned ("Fees may apply. See attached price list") but the referenced price list is not included in the PDF, leaving patients unable to assess costs upfront. No specific response time or turnaround commitment is stated. A Spanish version of the form is available, which is a positive accessibility feature for the Phoenix market.

## Overall Assessment

St. Joseph's earns credit for the structural decision to maintain a dedicated patient access form — a practice that most organizations do not follow. The form offers genuine patient choice in record types and delivery formats. However, the lack of fillable fields, complex routing instructions, discretionary "acceptance" language, and missing fee schedule prevent the experience from reaching its potential. The result is an organization that has the right framework but falls short in execution, landing at a **C grade (3.40)** that reflects adequate but improvable service to patients requesting their own records.

# EyeSouth Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a practice management organization (PMO) headquartered in Atlanta, GA, operating a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. It is a HIPAA covered entity with a designated Privacy Officer, but the corporate website is entirely partnership-focused with no patient-facing content. Two ROI forms were retrieved — neither from EyeSouth Partners itself, but from individual affiliates: Center for Sight (Florida) and Georgia Retina (Georgia).

## Available Pathways

A patient seeking records from an EyeSouth Partners affiliate faces a fragmented landscape. The parent organization offers no downloadable form, no patient portal, and no records request page. Its privacy policy directs patients to write to the Privacy Officer at corporate headquarters — a mail-only pathway with no form to guide the request. Individual affiliates handle records requests independently: some offer downloadable PDF forms (Center for Sight, Georgia Retina), others use third-party online portals like Sharecare (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye Partners), and at least one has a broken forms page (Georgia Eye Partners, returning 404).

The most relevant forms for patient self-access are the two retrieved PDF forms. **Form 1** (Center for Sight) is a concise, plain-language "Medical Information Release Form" with a patient-friendly tone and 10-business-day processing commitment. **Form 2** (Georgia Retina) is a more detailed "Authorization for Use, Release, or Request of Your Health Information" with HIPAA rights statements but also a $25 fee disclosure and a reason-for-release requirement. Both are one-page, single-purpose authorization forms. Form 1 represents the better patient experience overall and is treated as the primary form for scoring purposes.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to move records "to or from" the affiliated practice. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal right to their own records without needing to provide a reason. The parent organization provides no pathway at all — a patient who only knows they received care "under EyeSouth Partners" would struggle to find any usable process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms required significant effort. Direct searches for "EyeSouth Partners" ROI forms returned nothing. The corporate website has no patient resources section. Forms were located only by identifying specific affiliated practices and searching their individual websites. This multi-step, knowledge-dependent process is a major barrier: a patient must already know which specific practice treated them, find that practice's website, and hope a form is posted there.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms have a text layer (not image-only scans) but **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete by hand. Form 1 uses plain, accessible language with a logical top-down flow (patient info → sender/receiver → date range → reasons → authorization → signature). Its listing of 11 Center for Sight locations with full addresses and fax numbers is dense but functional for identifying where to send the form. Form 2 is more text-dense, with rights disclosures consuming half the page and no visual section headers or dividers. Neither form offers checkboxes for record types, format/delivery options, or electronic submission instructions.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form 1 contains an indefinite authorization ("will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing") with no automatic expiration — potentially problematic under HIPAA § 164.508. Form 2 discloses a flat $25 fee for record reproduction without distinguishing patient access requests (where HIPAA fee limits apply) from third-party releases. Form 2 also asks patients to "list the reason for releasing this information," which HIPAA does not require for patient access. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both imply fax submission is available through listed fax numbers. Form 2 is dated June 2016 — nearly a decade old, predating the HHS Right of Access Initiative and the Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Notable Strengths

- Form 1's 10-business-day processing commitment sets a clear, HIPAA-compliant expectation
- Form 1's warm closing ("we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care") is unusually humanizing
- Both forms are appropriately concise at one page each
- No notarization or witness requirements on either form

## Overall Assessment

EyeSouth Partners presents a below-average patient experience for records access. The fundamental problem is structural: a decentralized PMO with no centralized patient-facing process, forcing patients to navigate affiliate-specific pathways that vary widely in approach and quality. The best available forms are generic authorization documents that don't recognize patient self-access as a distinct use case. While the forms themselves are functional and concise, their paper-first design (no fillable fields), lack of patient rights language, and compliance issues (indefinite authorization, flat fee, reason requirement) prevent them from achieving more than a middling score. The organization earns a **C** grade, reflecting adequate but unexceptional service that requires a patient to work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights.

# Southwell (Tift Regional Health System) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Southwell's medical release page at `mysouthwell.com/medical-release/` presents four downloadable documents. Two are parallel ROI authorization forms — one for the hospital system (form-1, "TRHS Authorization to Release/Obtain PHI," 2 pages) and one for the ambulatory clinics (form-3, "SWA Authorization to Release Protected Health Information," 1 page). Form-2 is a newer image-only scan (July 2025, produced on a Canon copier) that appears to be a revised version of form-1 but with degraded quality and no text layer. Form-4 is a reference list of ~40 TRHS entity names and addresses, not an ROI form. The organization also references Verisma as an online records request partner at a separate page (`mysouthwell.com/medical-record-request/`), but this pathway was not directly evaluated as part of the form download process.

The most relevant form for patient self-access at the hospital system is **form-1**, the TRHS authorization. It has a text layer, logical numbered structure, and covers the main hospital facilities. Form-3 serves the same role for ambulatory clinics.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Southwell does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All downloadable forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. They require the patient to name a recipient ("This information may be disclosed to and used by the following individual or organization") even when the patient is requesting records for personal use. "Personal Use" appears as one of six purpose checkboxes, but the form's architecture assumes a third-party release workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no simplified self-access flow. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, figuring out that they should write their own name in the "recipient" field.

The split between TRHS hospital forms and SWA ambulatory forms further fragments the experience. A patient who received care at both a hospital and a specialty clinic would need to complete two separate authorization forms for two different legal entities, with no clear guidance about which form covers which facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was relatively straightforward. The medical release page is accessible via the website's navigation (Home → Patient & Visitors → Medical Release), and web searches surfaced the page without difficulty. No bot blocking or login requirements were encountered. However, the page presents multiple forms without clear differentiation — patients must determine whether form-1, form-2, or form-3 applies to their situation, and the relationship between the overlapping TRHS forms (form-1 vs. form-2) is unclear.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 (the best available) has a text layer and logical numbered structure (8 sections covering facility selection, record types, sensitive info notice, recipient, purpose, revocation, non-conditioning, and voluntary disclosure). It offers good granularity in record type selection — 10 categories with individual date range fields, plus delivery options (Paper, CD, Electronic Delivery). However, the form has **zero fillable fields**. All checkboxes and text fields are static, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. The form does not specify how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, email address, or mailing instructions for submission appear on the form itself (the mailing address in Section 6 relates to revocation, not submission).

The language is moderately legalistic, with dense compliance-driven text in the sensitive information notice and revocation sections. The layout is functional but the second page contains only two short paragraphs and signature lines, suggesting it could be consolidated. Form-2 represents a regression — an image-only scan with no text layer, no OCR, degraded readability, and Paper pre-checked as the delivery method.

## Barriers

Two notable barriers exist. First, a **witness signature** is required on all forms — HIPAA does not require witnesses for authorization or access requests, and this creates a real obstacle for patients completing forms independently at home. Second, all forms collect the **last 4 digits of SSN**, an unnecessary data element that creates privacy risk beyond what MRN and DOB provide.

No fees are mentioned on any form. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated. The 90-day default expiration on forms 1 and 3 (extended to one year on form-2) could force resubmission if processing is slow.

## Overall Assessment

Southwell provides a minimally functional but decidedly paper-oriented records request process. The forms are findable and structurally organized, with useful features like granular record type selection and an electronic delivery option. However, the lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, the fragmented multi-form landscape, and the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway all reflect a process designed for institutional convenience rather than patient self-service. The organization appears to offer a Verisma online portal as an alternative, which could meaningfully improve the digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms remain firmly rooted in a print-and-mail paradigm.

# Advocare, LLC — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Advocare, LLC provides three downloaded authorization forms and an online submission alternative:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): The current English-language "Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information," a 2-page fillable PDF with 41 interactive fields, revised January 2026. Linked directly from the official medical records page.
- **form-3.pdf**: A Spanish-language translation of the same authorization form, dated January 2024, with 44 fillable fields. Also linked from the medical records page.
- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An older single-page version (v2, April 2021) found on a different CDN path, likely from an individual practice sub-site. It has zero fillable fields and includes a Social Security Number field that the current version removed.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, Advocare's medical records page offers an **online request option via ShareCare** and a separate third-party requester portal. The PDF forms list mail and email as delivery options, and fax is implicitly available through their practice offices.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocare does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release. All three PDF forms are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for disclosure to third parties. However, form-2 includes a **"Patient Request" checkbox** under the purpose field, acknowledging patient-initiated requests. The structural awkwardness remains: a patient requesting their own records must still fill out "recipient" fields, essentially listing themselves as the party receiving disclosure. This is a common industry pattern but reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-access-first design.

The ShareCare online portal provides an alternative pathway, though it was not evaluated as a downloaded form in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Advocare's forms was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page, which clearly links to downloadable PDFs in English and Spanish, the ShareCare online portal, and a third-party requester portal. No bot blocking, authentication, or browser workarounds were needed. The only minor issue is that the legacy form-1.pdf remains discoverable via web search, creating a risk that patients could find and submit an outdated document.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2.pdf is a **born-digital, fillable PDF** with 41 interactive fields — a significant improvement over the legacy form-1 (which had zero fillable fields). The layout follows a logical flow: patient demographics → sending/receiving provider → purpose → date range → record types → sensitive categories → attestation → signature. The two-column sender/recipient layout is efficient, and the form includes 12 record-type checkboxes plus an "Abstract Record" shortcut (last year of encounters and results).

The language is a mix of standard HIPAA authorization phrasing and reasonably clear instructions. While not truly plain-language, it is accessible to most adults. One notable defect: the PDF contains a duplicated/garbled heading ("Select from thethe following...") — a layout error. The fillable fields also lack accessible names, which would impact screen reader users.

The Spanish version (form-3) is a high-quality professional translation with fillable fields, though it lacks the email delivery option present in the English form — a functional parity gap.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **No in-person submission requirement** — mail, email, and online (ShareCare) are available.
- **No fees disclosed** on the form — neither good nor bad, but not transparent.
- **No SSN field** on the current form (the legacy form-1 did collect SSN — a red flag that was corrected).
- **90-day default expiration** is shorter than the industry-typical 6 months, potentially requiring re-authorization if processing is slow.
- **30-day response timeline** is clearly stated, correctly reflecting HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering a professionally translated Spanish form alongside English is uncommon and valuable, especially in a Northeast practice.
- **"Abstract Record" option**: Provides a practical shortcut for patients who want a summary without selecting individual record types.
- **Reference Guide**: Page 2 defines sensitive information categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, reproductive services) in plain language with NJ law citations.
- **Email delivery option**: Explicitly offers electronic delivery alongside mail.
- **Online submission via ShareCare**: Provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Overall Assessment

Advocare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an independent physician practice. Forms are easy to find, fillable, available in two languages, and offer electronic submission. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must navigate a general-purpose authorization form designed around third-party disclosure. The "Patient Request" checkbox partially addresses this, but the form's structure still assumes a sender-to-recipient model that doesn't map cleanly to individual access rights. This is a solid B-level performance: competent, accessible, and showing genuine attention to patient needs, with room for improvement in truly centering the patient access experience.

# Nemaha Valley Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital, an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Seneca, Kansas, provides two documents on its Resources page: an "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-2.pdf). The authorization form is the only mechanism available for patients to request their records. A Spanish-language version of the authorization form is also linked from the same page but was not separately downloaded for evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for disclosures to named third parties — a patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient and navigate fields (purpose, recipient address) that assume a third-party disclosure scenario. There is no mention of HIPAA § 164.524, no "right of access" language, and no separate pathway for individual access requests. The NPP, by contrast, does describe the right to inspect and obtain copies and even commits to providing records in electronic format upon request — but this information lives in a 12-page compliance document, not in the actual request form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) is accessible within two clicks from the homepage, and a site-scoped web search surfaced the link quickly. The page labels the form clearly as "Authorization for Release of Health Information." No bot blocking or access restrictions were encountered. General `filetype:pdf` searches did not return direct results, but this is a minor issue given how easily the form was found through site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a significant weakness. It is an **image-only scan** — a photocopy of a paper form scanned by a Savin copier in 2016, with zero extractable text, zero fillable fields, and no accessibility metadata. The revision date is January 2014, making it over a decade old. The form must be printed and filled out entirely by hand.

The layout is functional but dated, using a typewriter-style font with hand-drawn lines. Page 1 follows a logical sequence: patient identification, recipient designation, purpose, a 14-item record-type checklist, treatment date range, legal disclosures, and signature block. Page 2 is an internal cost-calculation worksheet that probably should not have been included in the patient-facing download — it shows per-page copy rates, labor charges, and staff-use fields for tracking releases. Both pages are erroneously labeled "Page 2 of 2."

The legal language is reasonably clear for a healthcare authorization form, but it is presented as dense paragraph text with no bold headings or visual breaks between disclosure sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable red flag is the **Social Security Number field**, which is prominently placed alongside name, birthdate, and MRN. SSN collection is unnecessary for medical records release and creates identity theft risk — especially concerning for a form that must be physically handled (printed, mailed, or hand-delivered).

The form provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address for the records department, no fax number, and no mention of email or portal submission. A patient would need to call the hospital to learn how to submit the completed form. The cost worksheet on page 2 references pick-up, mail, and fax as record delivery methods, suggesting fax capability exists, but no fax number is provided on the form itself.

Fees are very reasonable: $0.03 per page for copies, with a $3.90 per 15-minute labor charge. The per-page rate is well within HIPAA limits. The $10 charges for CDs and USB drives are dated but not egregious.

## Notable Strengths

Despite its weaknesses, the hospital has several bright spots. The availability of a **Spanish-language authorization form** is notable for a small rural hospital in Kansas. The **14-item record-type checklist** gives patients granular control over what is released. The **NPP is excellent** — recently updated (February 2026), it names a specific Privacy Officer with direct phone and email, commits to electronic format delivery, includes HIE participation transparency, and offers multilingual nondiscrimination taglines in 15+ languages. The contrast between the polished, current NPP and the decade-old scanned authorization form is striking.

## Overall Assessment

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital earns a **C grade**. The form is easy to find and fees are fair, but the core patient experience is undermined by an image-only scan that forces a fully paper-based workflow, a generic third-party authorization form with no patient access differentiation, an SSN field that creates unnecessary risk, and a complete absence of submission instructions. The hospital clearly has the capacity to produce quality digital documents (as evidenced by the NPP), but has not applied that capability to its records request process.

# Ascension St. Vincent's East — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension St. Vincent's East is a community hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the Ascension health system that has recently partnered with or been rebranded under UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). This branding transition is the defining feature of the patient experience: two forms exist on two different websites under two different organizational names, and a patient searching under the facility's commonly known name may land on the wrong (legacy) form.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF authorization forms were found:

- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An Ascension St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization To Disclose Protected Health Information" revised February 2022, hosted on `healthcare.ascension.org` in a URL path containing the word "legacy." This 2.8 MB, 2-page form is a general-purpose ROI authorization with no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. It collects Social Security Number, lists notarized signature among identity verification options, and requires a witness signature — all potential barriers. On the positive side, it explicitly cites CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access).

- **form-2.pdf** (current): A UAB St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records" dated February 2026, hosted on `uabstvincents.org`. This is the current, most relevant form. At 143 KB and 2 pages, it is a cleaner, digital-origin document. It explicitly lists "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department" as a selectable location and includes a checkbox for "me for my personal use" — a meaningful distinction from forms that only contemplate third-party release.

The best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-2, which accommodates patient self-access as a first-class option alongside third-party authorization.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Form-2 does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release via a checkbox ("me for my personal use" vs. "the party indicated below"). This is a genuine improvement over many ROI forms and over this facility's own predecessor form. However, form-2 remains a generic authorization form — not a dedicated patient access request form. The same form, same legal language, and same process apply whether the patient wants their own records or is authorizing release to an insurer or attorney. A patient must navigate legal language about re-disclosure, initial two dense paragraphs about revocation and non-conditioning, and understand which fields apply to their scenario.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form required moderate effort. Initial searches for "Ascension St. Vincent's East" yielded system-wide Ascension forms from other states. An Alabama-specific search found the legacy form-1 on the Ascension domain. Only a separate search for "UAB St. Vincent's" uncovered the current form-2 on the UAB domain. A patient who knows this facility by its Ascension name would likely find only the outdated 2022 form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed — both PDFs downloaded directly.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a digital-origin PDF with a text layer, reasonable file size, and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all entries must be handwritten after printing. The form uses horizontal rules to separate sections and offers a well-designed tiered record selection (Key Clinical Notes bundle, Entire Medical Record, or specific report types). The "Key Clinical Notes" option — pre-defined as discharge summary, operative reports, labs, radiology, and ED documentation — is a genuine usability bright spot that helps patients who don't know medical terminology.

The opening paragraph front-loads dense legal language before the patient even fills in their name. The form contains a contradictory treatment of sensitive records: the opening paragraph states the request "includes" psychiatric and substance use information, while a later checkbox asks whether to include it. The submission instructions are indirect — rather than printing a mailing address, the form directs patients to visit a website.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-2 removes several barriers present in the legacy form: no Social Security Number field, no notarization option, no witness requirement. Non-conditioning and revocation rights are clearly stated (with initialing required). However, the form provides no fee disclosure whatsoever — patients have no idea what records will cost. The HIPAA Right of Access citation (CFR 164.524) present in form-1 was dropped in form-2, a notable regression. Submission appears limited to physical mail; no fax number or electronic submission option for the completed form is stated.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension St. Vincent's East earns credit for a reasonably well-designed authorization form that explicitly accommodates patient self-access with a personal-use checkbox and offers tiered record selection. However, the experience is undermined by the branding transition that makes the current form hard to find, zero fillable fields requiring a fully paper workflow, apparent mail-only form submission, and absent fee disclosure. The result is a facility that has the right instincts on patient-centeredness but falls short on digital accessibility and transparency.

# San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center — Synthesis

## Overview

San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center (SLV Health-RMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Alamosa, Colorado, part of the San Luis Valley Health regional system that also includes Conejos County Hospital (La Jara). The organization makes three PDF forms available online: a current English-language authorization form (form-1), a superseded 2013 English version (form-2, still publicly accessible but no longer linked), and a Spanish-language translation (form-3). All three are generic "Authorization to Release Medical Record Information" forms — none is designed specifically for patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Access Pathway

SLV Health does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All three forms use a "RELEASE FROM" / "RELEASE TO" structure designed for authorizing disclosure to a named recipient — an attorney, insurer, or other provider. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves in the "RELEASE TO" field, which is workable but unintuitive. There is no checkbox, pathway, or language acknowledging that a patient might simply want to access their own health information. No patient portal or online request wizard is offered for records requests.

The primary pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, then email the completed form to `MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org` or mail it to the facility. The email submission option is a meaningful convenience that prevents the need for in-person delivery.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **very easy**. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the organization's Medical Records page (`/patient-center/medical-records/`) clearly links to both the English and Spanish authorization forms. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only concern is that the older form-2 remains publicly accessible at its original URL and could surface in search results, potentially confusing patients about which version to use.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with extractable text — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are visual underlines meant for handwriting, and there is a "Patient Sticker" area intended for in-facility paper workflows. The form cannot be completed electronically within the PDF itself. This is clearly a print-oriented document.

The layout is dense but logically organized, flowing from facility identification through patient info, record type selection (six categories with initial-based checkboxes), expiration options, sensitive-condition authorization, and signature block. The language is moderately legalistic but generally understandable — the authorization statement is reasonably clear. Section headers provide hierarchy, though the initial-based checkbox convention `( )` requires familiarity.

The form lacks instructions or guidance text, offers no statement of patient rights, and makes no reference to HIPAA, turnaround times, or fees.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests Social Security Numbers as a standard identification field alongside name and date of birth — unnecessary for a records release authorization and creating identity theft risk. This is particularly concerning given the community's demographics.

The vague disclaimer **"San Luis Valley Health is not responsible if lost"** is poorly worded and could deter patients from submitting forms remotely. The **copies clause** (MAY/MAY NOT be used with same effectiveness as original) places an opaque legal decision on patients. A persistent **spelling error** ("INFORMATION REQUIRIED") has survived at least two revision cycles, suggesting limited quality control.

No notarization is required. No in-person submission is required. No fees are disclosed — neither their presence nor absence is mentioned.

## Bright Spots

The **Spanish-language form** is a genuine strength. It is co-located with the English version on the Medical Records page, requiring no extra navigation — appropriate and commendable for a community hospital serving the San Luis Valley's significant Latino population. The **email submission option** lowers the barrier compared to fax-only or mail-only processes. The **single-page design** is efficient, and the **granular record-type options** give patients meaningful control over scope.

## Overall Assessment

SLV Health-RMC earns credit for easy findability, bilingual support, and email submission — things many organizations fail to provide. However, the lack of a patient-specific access pathway, absence of fillable fields, SSN collection, and missing rights information keep this solidly in the middle tier. A patient can navigate the process, but the organization hasn't designed it with patient self-access in mind. The form serves its historical purpose as a generic release authorization; it has not evolved to meet the expectations of a patient-centered digital healthcare landscape. **Grade: C.**

# Shannon Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Shannon Health, a nonprofit regional health system in San Angelo, TX, provides a single Authorization for Release of Information (ROI) form for all records requests. The form is available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful accommodation for the area's large Hispanic population. While the form is easy to find and includes several patient-friendly features, it follows the common pattern of routing patient self-access requests through a generic third-party release authorization rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Forms & Pathways

Shannon Health offers two downloaded documents, but they are functionally one form in two languages:

- **form-1.pdf** (English): "Authorization for Release of Information," revised 06/2024
- **form-2.pdf** (Spanish): "Autorización para la Divulgación de Información," identical structure

The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-1.pdf (English). The form includes a "Self" checkbox under the recipient field and "Personal Use" among purpose options, acknowledging patient access as a use case. However, the form's structure — with fields for recipient organization, address, phone, fax, and relationship — assumes a third-party release scenario. A patient requesting their own records must navigate these irrelevant fields, with no guidance on how to handle them when "Self" is selected.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal for record requests, and no separate streamlined process for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The website's navigation path — **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** — leads directly to a page with clearly labeled download links for both language versions. This is a 2-click path from the homepage. One minor friction point: web search results initially returned outdated URLs (`medical-record-authorization.pdf`) that produced 404 errors. The filenames were updated for 2025 without redirects, creating link rot. Navigating the website directly resolved this.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores for handwriting; no checkboxes are interactive. For a form dated 2025, this is a significant missed opportunity. Patients must print the PDF, hand-fill all fields, then scan or photograph it for electronic submission.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → substance use disorder options → format → legal terms → signature → return instructions. The flow is intuitive, and the form uses reasonably clear language, though page 2's legal disclosures are denser. The form provides granular control over record scope with approximately 15 record type checkboxes, a date range field, and hospital/clinic selection. The three-option handling of substance use disorder records (include all, exclude all, select specific) is well-designed.

Approximately 25 fields require completion, which is proportionate for a general-purpose ROI form but more than a dedicated patient access form would need.

## Barriers

**Fees**: The form states fees "may" be charged and requires the patient to "agree to pay accordingly" — without disclosing amounts or referencing applicable fee limits. This vague blanket acceptance is the most significant concern; a patient has no idea what they're agreeing to.

**No notarization or witness** required. **No in-person submission** required — email is explicitly listed as the "Preferred Method" via `ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org`. Mail and in-person delivery are also available. No fax submission is listed, but email more than compensates.

**Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) linked side-by-side on the records page — appropriate for San Angelo's demographics (~45% Hispanic)
- **Email as the preferred submission method** — unusually patient-friendly; most orgs default to fax or mail
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: MyChart portal access and encrypted email via ShareFile, in addition to paper, CD, pick-up, and mail
- **Non-conditioning disclosure**: Explicitly states Shannon cannot condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on signing the authorization — an important HIPAA protection many forms omit
- **Substance use disorder records handling**: Three clear options giving patients granular control over sensitive information

## Overall Assessment

Shannon Health delivers an above-average but not exceptional patient experience. The form is easy to find, reasonably well-designed, and submitted through a patient-friendly email channel. The bilingual offering and electronic delivery options are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (funneling patients through a generic third-party authorization), the absence of fillable fields in a 2025-edition form, and the vague fee disclosure prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process wasn't designed with that use case as the primary concern.

# Synthesis: Essentia Health-Fosston

## Overview

Essentia Health-Fosston is a critical access hospital in Fosston, MN, part of the regional nonprofit Essentia Health system. The facility does not maintain its own medical records forms; it uses system-wide Essentia Health documents for all records-related processes. Four documents were retrieved, but only one — the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (form-1, EH10843 12/25) — is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records. The other three documents serve adjacent purposes: MyChart portal enrollment (form-2), MyChart proxy access delegation (form-3), and verbal information-sharing authorization (form-4).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Essentia Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting records on behalf of someone else. Form-1 is a general-purpose authorization with "From" and "To" fields designed for transferring records between entities. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both fields — putting themselves as the recipient — and check "Personal use" as the reason. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and no tailored instructions for self-access requests. That said, Essentia Health does offer meaningful alternatives: the medical records page directs patients to **MyChart** as the primary access pathway and provides a **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** as a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link, and Essentia Health's medical records page (`essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`) is well-organized with clearly labeled download links. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was required. The URL structure is clean and descriptive. All forms are hosted on the main Essentia Health domain (except the MyChart-related forms on `essentiamychart.org`).

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page**, digitally-designed PDF with a complete text layer — impressively compact for the scope it covers. The layout follows a logical flow from patient demographics through release details, record type selection, delivery method, and legal notices. The form offers strong record type granularity with 18+ individual checkboxes plus an "All Routine Records" shortcut, and appropriately separates behavioral health and substance use disorder records with distinct opt-in/opt-out controls.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally composed. All data entry uses blank underscores, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a consistent pattern across all four Essentia Health forms and appears to be a deliberate system-wide design choice rather than a per-form oversight. The delivery method options are a bright spot: patients can receive records via MyChart, email, fax, or mail (paper or disc).

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unusual barriers — no notarization, no witness requirement (except for mark-based signatures), no in-person-only submission. Submission is available via email, fax, or mail. Fee language is vague: "I may be required to pay a fee for retrieval and photocopying of records," citing state statutes rather than HIPAA cost-based fee limits, with no specific amounts disclosed. The form properly includes anti-conditioning language, revocation rights, psychotherapy note protections, and 42 CFR Part 2 SUD protections. One notable issue: the MyChart enrollment forms (form-2, form-3) collect partial SSN, which is unnecessary for portal access and creates data minimization concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** provides a fully digital alternative pathway
- **Single-page form** — remarkably compact for comprehensive ROI coverage
- **Electronic delivery options** including email and MyChart — not just fax/mail
- **Multi-state legal compliance** across MN, WI, and ND
- **Recently revised** (December 2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Well-organized medical records page** with clear navigation and multiple pathway options

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization
- **Zero fillable fields** across all four system forms — entirely print-and-handwrite
- **Vague fee disclosure** with no specific amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee reference
- **Form-3 (MyChart proxy)** published as a proof copy with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers
- **Behavioral health opt-out vs. SUD opt-in** inconsistency may confuse patients

## Overall Assessment

Essentia Health-Fosston earns a **B grade**. The organization benefits from its parent system's well-organized web presence, a compact and recently-updated authorization form, and the availability of a digital request portal. The main limitations are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients must use a generic third-party authorization form) and the absence of fillable fields on any PDF form. The Swellbox portal partially compensates for the PDF's technical shortcomings, and the multiple electronic submission and delivery options keep the process accessible. A patient can successfully request their records without visiting the facility, but the process isn't designed around them.

# Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Penn Medicine (the parent system for HUP) provides two main pathways for patients seeking their medical records. The **primary pathway** for patient self-access is the **myPennMedicine patient portal**, which the organization's website explicitly directs patients toward. The **secondary pathway** is a downloadable PDF — the "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (form UPHS-099-9, revised December 2020) — a system-wide authorization form used across all Penn Medicine facilities.

Two versions of this PDF form were found: the current version (form-1.pdf) hosted on Penn Medicine's own infrastructure, and an outdated 2018 version (form-2.pdf) hosted on a third-party neurology practice website. The current form is the basis for this quality assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Penn Medicine **partially differentiates** patient self-access from third-party release — but only at the website level, not at the form level. The patient access web page directs patients wanting their own records to the myPennMedicine portal, reserving the PDF authorization form for broader disclosure purposes. However, the form itself is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that makes no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. A patient using the form must fill in their own name in the "I request my PHI to be released to" field, which is functional but not intuitive. The form includes one notable sentence acknowledging patient rights: "I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the authorization form required **moderate effort**. A web search surfaced the form from Penn's medical school subdomain (med.upenn.edu). The official Penn Medicine patient access page links to the same form but was initially blocked by **Incapsula bot protection** on programmatic fetches, requiring browser fallback. The form is not immediately discoverable from the Penn Medicine homepage — patients must navigate to Patient Resources → Patient Access Health Information.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a **strong digital artifact** with **70 fillable interactive fields** — covering patient demographics, facility checkboxes, 14 record-type selections, behavioral health/SUD opt-in, delivery method, and signature blocks. The ADA-accessible designation in the filename suggests intentional accessibility design. The layout is well-organized across two pages: page 1 contains the authorization itself, page 2 provides detailed instructions with submission addresses for six Penn Medicine hospitals.

Language quality is mixed: core instructions are clear, but the authorization section uses dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation. The behavioral health consent language is notably well-written and patient-respectful.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Submission method is the key barrier.** The PDF form must be physically mailed to the appropriate hospital's Medical Records Department — there is no fax submission (Penn Medicine explicitly restricts fax to urgent patient care situations), no email submission of the form, and no online submission pathway for the authorization itself. This makes the PDF pathway a predominantly paper-based process despite the excellent digital form.

**Fee transparency is weak.** The form states Penn Medicine "will charge for copying records in accordance with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware law" without specifying amounts. This references state law rather than HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient access, potentially resulting in overcharging. Radiology images are explicitly free.

**Ambulatory carve-out is buried.** The instruction that "Any Ambulatory/Office Visit requests should be addressed to the individual Physician's Office" is on page 2 and could cause patients to miss outpatient records.

## Notable Strengths

- **70 fillable PDF fields** — among the most thoroughly digitized forms encountered
- **ADA-accessible** PDF design with proper text encoding and interactive elements
- **Granular record selection** with 14 types plus behavioral health/SUD opt-in
- **Explicit patient rights language** acknowledging the right to inspect records directly
- **Free radiology images** — a patient-friendly policy
- **Clear compliance provisions**: 30/60-day response timelines, denial/appeal rights with Chief Privacy Officer contact, no notarization required, treatment not conditioned on signing

## Overall Assessment

Penn Medicine demonstrates institutional competence in form design — the fillable PDF is technically excellent and the instructions are thorough. However, the organization's approach to patient self-access is bifurcated: the portal handles self-access while the PDF form serves as a general-purpose disclosure authorization that doesn't optimize for individual access rights. The mail-only submission requirement for the PDF form is a meaningful barrier. A patient who cannot or does not use the portal faces a paper-based workflow despite the digitally fillable form. For a major academic medical center, the gap between the quality of the form document and the quality of the submission/delivery infrastructure is notable.

# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Newton-Wellesley Hospital (NWH) is a community hospital in Newton, MA, part of the Mass General Brigham (MGB) health system (formerly Partners HealthCare). For medical records requests, NWH uses the system-wide MGB authorization form rather than a facility-specific document. Two forms were found: the current MGB-branded authorization (form-1, dated 06/2024) and a legacy Partners HealthCare version (form-2, dated 01/2006) that remains accessible at an orphaned URL on nwh.org but is no longer linked from current navigation.

## Access Pathway

NWH does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary (and only current) form is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" designed to serve all release scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, and other recipients. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as someone authorizing release to a third party, selecting "Personal" as the purpose and checking a box to have records mailed to their own address. While functional, this approach requires patients to identify which sections apply to them and which to skip, without explicit guidance distinguishing patient access rights from third-party authorization.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. It frames the interaction as an "authorization" rather than a right, which is technically appropriate for third-party releases but conceptually misaligned for patient self-access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The NWH website provides a clear navigable path (Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records), though this redirects to the MGB parent system's medical records page where the user must expand a "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" accordion to access the download. This extra indirection is minor. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1) is a high-quality digital artifact. It features **78 fillable/interactive form fields** — checkboxes, text inputs, and date fields are all functional for on-screen completion. The form is organized into five clearly lettered sections (A through E) with a logical flow: patient info → permission/purpose → record types → sensitive information → understanding/signature. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The header prominently displays submission instructions (mailing address and fax number), and the form offers four delivery methods for the records themselves: Patient Gateway (portal), Secure Email, Fax, and Paper Copy via Mail. The inclusion of electronic delivery options is a notable strength.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though Section D (sensitive information authorization) contains dense regulatory text, particularly the 42 CFR Part 2 disclosure. This is legally required but not reader-friendly.

**Multilingual support** is a bright spot: the MGB medical records page offers the form in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

## Barriers

**Notarization**: Not required. Only a patient signature is needed.

**Fees**: The form subtly differentiates — copying fees are asterisked only for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes, while "Personal" and "Medical Care" are not marked, implying no fees for patient access requests. However, this is implicit rather than explicitly stated.

**Date requirement**: Section C states patients "MUST specify dates" (capitalized emphasis) for each record type category. HIPAA does not require patients to specify date ranges, and this requirement could function as a barrier for patients seeking comprehensive access to their records.

**Outside records carve-out**: Records from outside providers held by MGB will not be released unless the patient specifically requests them under "Other" — placing a knowledge burden on patients who may not know what outside records exist in their file.

## Strengths

- 78 fillable form fields enabling genuine digital completion
- Four delivery methods including portal and secure email
- Trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Portuguese)
- Implicit fee exemption for patient access requests
- Clean, well-organized layout with clear section headers
- Easy findability via web search or website navigation

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway; generic third-party authorization form only
- "MUST specify dates" requirement potentially exceeds HIPAA requirements
- No explicit statement of patient Right of Access
- Outside records require special knowledge to request
- Submission limited to fax or mail (no online form submission)

## Overall Assessment

Newton-Wellesley Hospital, through its parent system MGB, provides a technically well-executed authorization form that is easy to find and genuinely usable digitally. The form's 78 fillable fields, multilingual availability, and multiple delivery options represent above-average document quality. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, funneling all requestors through a generic authorization form. The "MUST specify dates" requirement and lack of Right of Access framing are missed opportunities to center the patient experience. Overall, this is a competent but generic approach — the form works, but it wasn't designed with the patient requesting their own records as the primary audience.

# Hartford Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hartford Hospital is part of Hartford HealthCare (HHC), a regional nonprofit health system in Connecticut. For medical records requests, the organization uses the system-wide "Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information" form (HH Forms 571559, Rev. 11-2022), a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all 11 HHC facilities. Three PDF documents were retrieved: the system-wide form hosted on two different HHC domains (form-1 and form-3, which are textually identical), and an older Institute of Living–specific variant from 2012 (form-2). The primary form for a patient seeking their own records is form-1.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Route

Hartford Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The system-wide form is a general-purpose authorization designed equally for third-party release (to insurers, attorneys, other providers) and patient self-access. The form's structure — "I authorize _____ to disclose/obtain health information to: ______" — is fundamentally oriented around third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must puzzle over which blank to fill with the hospital's name and which with their own.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient" as one checkbox alongside "Medical," "Legal," "Disability," and "Insurance," correctly marked as "(Optional)." But the form offers no simplified pathway, no separate section, and no explanatory text for patients exercising their Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524. The patient must navigate the same form and fields designed for attorneys and insurance companies.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The parent system's medical records page at `hartfordhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/patients/medical-records` is well-organized and links directly to the authorization form. However, a patient starting at `hartfordhospital.org` must navigate to the parent system's site. A previously indexed URL for the form now returns a 404 error, meaning patients following older search results or bookmarks encounter a dead link. The current URL uses an opaque numeric filename (`571559.pdf`) that gives no indication of the document's contents.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised in November 2022, every field is rendered as static underscored blank lines. A patient must print the form and complete it by hand — or use a PDF annotation tool as a workaround. For a major regional health system, the absence of any interactive form fields is a significant missed opportunity.

The layout is dense but logically organized: patient identification → source/destination → delivery method → record types → purpose → rights/signature. However, the form opens with staff-facing administrative fields (MR#, Date Completed, Pages Copied, Initials) that have no relevance to patients and may cause confusion. The record type section offers 19 checkbox options — useful granularity for specificity but potentially overwhelming for patients who simply want "my records." Sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse, reproductive health) are appropriately broken out with corresponding legal notices on page 2.

The language is moderately legalistic. The opening sentence is a dense multi-clause construction that packs in references to mental illness, substance abuse, HIV, and reproductive services. Page 2's legal notices contain typographical errors ("If the event" instead of "In the event") and inconsistent capitalization.

## Submission Methods and Barriers

The form lists fax numbers and mailing addresses for all 11 HHC facilities, making submission by fax or mail straightforward. There is no email address, web portal, or online submission option. Fax qualifies as an adequate electronic pathway per our scoring baseline.

**No notarization or witness is required.** No fees are mentioned on the form. The form correctly states that treatment is not conditioned on signing the authorization, and that the patient may inspect or copy their information. The purpose field is correctly marked optional.

## Bright Spots

- **Comprehensive facility directory**: All 11 HHC facilities listed with addresses and fax numbers as checkboxes, eliminating the common pain point of not knowing where to send the form.
- **Connecticut-specific protections**: Detailed legal notice blocks for HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, and reproductive health records, citing applicable state and federal law.
- **Purpose marked optional**: Correctly implements the HIPAA principle that patients need not justify access requests.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Separate checkboxes for specially protected categories give patients granular control.

## Red Flags

- **Stale URL returning 404**: Older links to the form lead to a dead end.
- **Confusing dual-purpose "disclose/obtain" structure**: Patients must determine which direction of information flow applies to them.
- **"Electronic" delivery undefined**: Listed as an option with no explanation of what it means in practice.
- **Typographical errors**: Multiple instances of "If the event" instead of "In the event" on page 2.

## Overall Assessment

Hartford Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request experience. The system-wide form covers the basics and includes appropriate compliance language, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and generic third-party authorization structure all represent missed opportunities to serve patients well. The form is a C-grade experience: a patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them in mind.

# Hendrick Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hendrick Health, a nonprofit regional hospital system based in Abilene, TX, provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records requests — one for the hospital arm (Hendrick Medical Center, including South and Brownwood campuses) and one for the outpatient clinic arm (Hendrick Clinic). Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information, not dedicated patient self-access request forms. No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Hendrick Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting disclosure. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information (PHI)" and frame the transaction as a release between two named parties. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name in the "authorize" blank and again in the "who can receive" section — a workflow designed for attorneys, insurers, and other requestors, not for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The forms do include "Personal Use" as one of seven disclosure reasons, which accommodates patient self-access, but it is not highlighted or explained. There is no mention of the patient's Right of Access, no fee limitation language, and no stated response timeline.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Standard web searches immediately surfaced the Medical Records page (hendrickhealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/), which links directly to both PDFs with clear descriptions. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, login wall, or browser automation was required. The URLs are descriptive and stable. This is a findability bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1 (hospital)** is the stronger of the two forms and represents the best available pathway. It is a single-page flat PDF (zero fillable fields) with a text layer — digitally created from a Word document but exported without interactive form fields. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit via fax (325-670-6538), mail, email, or in-person pickup. The Hendrick Service Center address and contact information are pre-populated, reducing patient guesswork.

The form is organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → sensitive record initials → reason for disclosure → legal text → party identification → signatures. Record type granularity is a strength, with 16+ specific checkboxes plus an "all health information" option. However, the legal text in the lower third is dense, small-font legalese citing Texas Health & Safety Code § 181.154(c) and 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(1). No plain-language summary of patient rights is provided.

**Form-2 (clinic)** is structurally identical but notably weaker: it omits the email delivery option, lacks pre-filled contact information (leaving patients unsure where to submit), and omits a dates-of-service field. Patients who received care at both hospital and clinic entities would need to complete two separate forms with no cross-referencing guidance.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization, witness, or in-person submission is required — these are positive absences. Fees are not mentioned at all (neither disclosed nor waived). The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is unnecessary for HIPAA-compliant record identification but is a minor rather than severe barrier.

Both forms misspell "HIPAA" as "HIPPA" — a factual error that appears in the opening paragraph and undermines credibility. Form-2's PDF metadata exposes internal document management details ("Page 2__05.2022 MASTER-Authorization to Obtain or Release PHI- - Copy.docx"), suggesting careless export. The title of form-1 ("Authorization to Release Health Information") contradicts its subtitle ("Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information"), creating directional confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery** on the hospital form is uncommon and provides a digital delivery pathway
- **Pre-populated facility contact information** on form-1 reduces patient burden
- **Granular record selection** gives patients meaningful control over what is released
- **Single-page format** keeps the form manageable despite dense content

## Overall Assessment

Hendrick Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find and free of major barriers, but the organization channels all requestors — patients, attorneys, insurers — through the same generic authorization form without acknowledging that patient self-access is a distinct right with different rules. The flat, non-fillable PDFs represent a missed opportunity for digital-first design, and the split between hospital and clinic forms adds unnecessary complexity. A patient can get their records here without undue hardship, but the process was clearly not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Labette Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Labette Health is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Parsons, Kansas. It takes a notably digital-first approach to medical records requests: rather than offering a downloadable PDF authorization form, it routes patients to an **online Formstack form** accessible directly from the main website navigation. This places Labette Health ahead of many peers who still rely on print-and-mail PDF workflows.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents were downloaded during the search, but **neither is Labette Health's actual ROI form**:

- **form-1.pdf** — A generic one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" template from PatientPop, hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It does not mention Labette Health anywhere and surfaced only as a misleading search result. It has no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and is missing core HIPAA authorization elements.
- **form-2.pdf** — Labette Health's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), effective November 2021. This is an informational compliance document, not a request mechanism. It does reference the right to inspect and copy records and the right to an electronic copy, but does not link to the actual request form.

The **primary and only pathway** for requesting records is the Formstack online form at `https://labetteheatlh.formstack.com/forms/medical_records_request` (note: the subdomain contains a typo — "labetteheatlh" instead of "labettehealth"). The Contact Us page also mentions visiting the office in person as an alternative.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Labette Health's Formstack form **does differentiate** between patient self-access and third-party release. It includes a "Release direction" field with "to Patient/Self" as an explicit option alongside "Other," and a "Relationship to patient" field that includes "Patient/Self" as the first choice. While it is a single form serving multiple purposes rather than a dedicated patient-only form, the self-access pathway is clearly accommodated — a patient does not need to guess which parts apply to them.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating the website directly; standard web searches returned only the irrelevant PatientPop template. The website blocks simple HTTP fetches (returns 403), necessitating browser-based navigation. However, once on the site, the form is **easy to find**: the main navigation under "Patients & visitors" contains a direct "Medical records request form" link. The Contact Us page also links to it. Overall retrieval difficulty is **moderate** — the form is well-placed on the website but invisible to search engines and requires browser access.

## Form Document Quality

The Formstack form is a strong digital-first implementation:

- **Fully interactive**: All fields are fillable online with no printing required
- **Electronic signature**: Includes a signature pad for digital signing
- **Comprehensive record types**: 15+ specific checkboxes (COVID-19, Abstract, Clinic Note, Discharge Summary, EKG/Stress Test, ER Record, H&P, Lab Results, Operative Report, Radiology CD/Report, Sleep Study, Vaccination History, etc.)
- **Date range**: Includes date(s) of service field
- **Email delivery**: Offers an email delivery option for receiving records
- **Photo ID upload**: Built-in identity verification via file upload
- **Sensitive information**: Explicit exclusion options for mental health, communicable diseases, and drug/alcohol records
- **HIPAA language**: Standard authorization language including 1-year expiration, right to revoke, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warning

The layout is structured with clear sections and the field count (~15-20 fields) is reasonable for a comprehensive records request.

## Barriers and Compliance

No unnecessary barriers were identified. There is no notarization requirement, no witness requirement, and no mandatory in-person submission. The form submits electronically upon completion. The NPP mentions that copies may incur a "reasonable fee" but provides no specific amounts — this is standard HIPAA language but leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **Digital-first, no-paper workflow**: Among the most modern approaches observed for a community hospital of this size
- **Patient self-access clearly supported**: "Patient/Self" is an explicit option, not an afterthought
- **Comprehensive NPP**: Includes an unusually detailed Kansas HIT/HIO section and complete Privacy Officer contact information (name, address, phone, email)
- **Email delivery option**: Patients can request records via email, going beyond the typical CD or paper delivery

## Weaknesses and Concerns

- **URL typo**: The Formstack subdomain "labetteheatlh" (missing an "h") is fragile — if corrected upstream, existing links would break
- **No PDF alternative**: Patients without reliable internet access have no downloadable form option (only in-person office visit)
- **NPP doesn't link to the form**: The NPP tells patients to "complete a specific form" to exercise access rights but never identifies which form or where to find it
- **Website blocks automated access**: 403 errors on HTTP fetches could impact accessibility tools or screen readers that rely on direct URL access

## Overall Assessment

Labette Health provides a genuinely patient-centered, digital-first records request experience that stands out for an independent community hospital. The Formstack form is well-designed, comprehensive, and clearly accommodates patient self-access. The main gaps are the lack of a PDF fallback, the URL typo, and the disconnect between the NPP and the actual request mechanism. Overall, this organization earns a **B grade** — above average in technical accessibility and patient-centeredness, with minor findability and disclosure gaps preventing a top score.

# Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital is part of Samaritan Health Services (SHS), a nonprofit regional health system in Oregon's Willamette Valley. All records request forms and processes operate at the system level — there are no facility-specific forms for the Lebanon campus. Five documents were retrieved: a standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information in English (form-4) and Spanish (form-5), a specialized Computer Readable EHI Export Request in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3).

## Pathways Available

SHS offers three distinct pathways for patients requesting their own records:

1. **MRO Express Online Portal** — The primary pathway the website directs patients toward. This is an outsourced third-party portal (MRO Corp.) for submitting records requests online. No downloadable PDF is produced; the request is web-based.

2. **Standard Authorization Form (form-4/form-5)** — A general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" PDF covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Submittable by mail, fax, or email. Available in English and Spanish.

3. **EHI Computer Readable Export Form (form-1/form-2)** — A specialized form for requesting health information in machine-readable format. Also available in English and Spanish. This is a notably rare offering.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The standard form (form-4) is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it handles the distinction reasonably well: Section 3 includes a "Personal" checkbox for purpose, and Section 7 splits into "released to myself" (with multiple delivery options) versus "OR release my records to" a third party. This is a combined form, not a dedicated patient access pathway, but the dual structure is functional and the patient self-access route is clearly accommodated.

The EHI export form (form-1) is genuinely patient-centric — its purpose field comes pre-checked as "Patient Request - Electronic" and the entire form is designed around patient self-access. However, this serves only the niche use case of computer-readable data export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the downloadable forms was **difficult**. The medical records request page primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal. The PDF form download links are hidden inside a collapsed accordion section titled "Sending a Request by Mail or Fax" that required browser DevTools (JavaScript link extraction) to discover. Web searches returned confusable results from unrelated organizations with similar names. A patient who prefers a traditional form rather than the online portal would struggle to find the PDF.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-4) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean text and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete it by hand despite the form being digital in origin. The form uses numbered sections (1–9) with clear headers and a matching instruction page. The language mixes functional plain language with legal boilerplate; the rights section is dense but the instructions on page 2 are more accessible. Record type granularity is strong, with 11 specific checkboxes plus an "Other" field.

Format and delivery options are a genuine bright spot: patients can choose from MyChart, email, paper, CD, fax, or write in an alternative. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery, which is uncommon among ROI forms.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees**: The fee disclosure is exemplary. Form-4 explicitly states "Initial Patient Request: No Charge" and "Continuing Care: No Charge," with fees only for third-party requests. However, the EHI export form (form-1) lacks this "no charge" language, stating only that "reasonable cost-based fees apply" — an inconsistency that could deter patients seeking computer-readable data.

**Processing time**: Stated as "up to 30 days," within HIPAA's permitted window.

**No notarization** required. No in-person-only submission requirement — mail, fax, and email are all accepted.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by mail, fax (541-768-9363), or email (SHSHIMROI@samhealth.org). The email option is notable — it allows fully electronic submission even without the MRO portal, though the non-fillable PDF creates an awkward print-fill-scan-email workflow.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: All forms (standard ROI and EHI export) are available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Dedicated EHI export form**: Offering a separate form specifically for computer-readable health information export is exceptionally rare and demonstrates genuine Cures Act awareness.
- **Fee transparency**: The three-tier fee structure with "No Charge" for patient requests is clear and patient-friendly.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Six format options including two electronic channels (MyChart and email).
- **Email submission channel**: Accepting form submission via email lowers barriers significantly.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDFs**: All forms have zero interactive fields despite being digitally authored — a clear missed opportunity.
- **Hidden download links**: The downloadable forms are buried in collapsed accordion sections, requiring technical effort to discover.
- **No dedicated patient access form**: The standard form serves both patient self-access and third-party release, requiring patients to navigate which sections apply.
- **EHI export fee ambiguity**: The EHI form does not match the standard form's "no charge" commitment for patient requests.

## Overall Assessment

Samaritan Health Services provides a solid, above-average experience for patients requesting their own records. The combination of an online portal as the primary pathway, a well-structured authorization form with multiple delivery options, bilingual availability, transparent fee disclosures, and a rare dedicated EHI export form puts this organization ahead of most peers. The main gaps are the non-fillable PDF forms and the poor discoverability of the downloadable form option. The organization clearly takes patient access seriously, even if the form design hasn't been fully modernized for digital-first completion.

# Desert Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Regional Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Palm Springs, CA, operated by Desert Care Network, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare. Two forms were found: an English-language ROI authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are 2-page digitally created PDFs available from a dedicated medical records page on the Desert Care Network website.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

Desert Regional does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization for the Release of Health Information" and are structured as third-party disclosure authorizations — the patient authorizes Desert Regional to release records *to* a named recipient. A patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient, an awkward workaround that conflates the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) with the authorization framework of § 164.508. There is no separate form, section, or instructions addressing patient self-access as a distinct use case.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient/patient representative" as one option, but "Continuation of Care" appears as the default/first option, further underscoring the form's third-party orientation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A direct `filetype:pdf` search yielded nothing, but a site-specific search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/patients/request-medical-records`. That page is well-organized, with per-hospital download links in both English and Spanish. Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic downloads, requiring browser-based workarounds — though a patient using a standard browser would not encounter this. Overall, the form is roughly 2–3 clicks from the homepage via a logical navigation path.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is digitally authored with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite. This is a significant missed opportunity given the digital-native construction. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, recipient info, 12 record-type checkboxes, date range, purpose, and delivery method. The layout is logical and readable, following a clear top-to-bottom sequence. Language tilts toward legal/administrative but is not impenetrably dense; the rights section uses standard HIPAA authorization language with four-exception conditional clauses that could benefit from plain-language explanation.

Delivery method options include patient pickup, mail, fax, and email — the inclusion of email is a positive differentiator. The form header provides phone, fax, and email contact for the HIM department, giving patients multiple submission channels.

## Spanish Translation Quality

The Spanish form (form-2.pdf) mirrors the English version in structure and content, but suffers from **pervasive typographical errors** — at least 9 distinct misspellings including "APCIENTE" (PACIENTE), "cofidencialidad" (confidencialidad), and "DIVILGACIÓN" (DIVULGACIÓN). More consequentially, the Spanish form **omits the delivery method section** entirely, meaning Spanish-speaking patients cannot indicate how they want to receive their records. The fax number in the Spanish header also appears truncated. These errors suggest the translation was not professionally reviewed and create a meaningful disparity in service quality for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no mandatory in-person submission, and no explicit fee requirements. Revocation rights and authorization expiration are clearly stated. However, the form says nothing about fees — neither disclosing them nor stating they don't apply for patient access. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, and the rights section covers only authorization-related rights (voluntariness, revocation). There is no mention of electronic health information export or the patient's right to receive records in their requested format.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful for the Coachella Valley's large Spanish-speaking population
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear, per-hospital download links
- **Email as a delivery option** is more progressive than many ROI forms
- **Multiple HIM contact channels** (phone, fax, email) on the form header

## Overall Assessment

Desert Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The primary pathway is a generic third-party release form with no differentiation for patient self-access — a common but patient-unfriendly pattern. The form is reasonably well-organized and findable, but the lack of fillable fields and the poor quality of the Spanish translation diminish the overall experience. A patient can submit via fax or email (adequate electronic pathways), but must first print and handwrite the form. The organization earns credit for bilingual availability and a clear website presence, but falls short on patient-centeredness and digital accessibility.

# Community Health Center of Central Missouri — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Community Health Center of Central Missouri (CHCCMO), an independent nonprofit FQHC with four clinic locations across central Missouri, publishes a single general-purpose ROI form — an "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." Two versions were found: a current 2025 update (form-1) and a superseded 2023 version (form-2). Both are hosted as publicly accessible WordPress uploads on chccmo.org. There is no online portal, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no dedicated patient access form. The PDF form, submitted by fax, mail, email, or in-person pickup, is the only pathway.

## Access Pathway: No Individual Access Differentiation

CHCCMO does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party release. Both versions use a generic FROM/TO routing structure designed for provider-to-provider transfers. The 2025 form asks patients to specify "Please send my records FROM" and "Please send my records TO," with checkboxes for CHCCMO or "Other" at each end. A patient wanting their own records must navigate this structure, filling in their personal information in the TO field — a workflow clearly designed for transfers between entities, not for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). Neither form references HIPAA, the Right of Access, or patient access rights beyond a brief acknowledgment section.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **trivially easy**. A standard web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No site navigation, bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The filename (`Release-of-Records-updated-2025.pdf`) is descriptive. However, the older 2023 version remains publicly accessible at a different URL with no indication it is superseded, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The 2025 form (form-1) is the primary document and represents the organization's current offering. It is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite all entries. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → sender/receiver routing → delivery method → record types → date range → purpose → acknowledgment → signature. However, the page is densely packed, and the multi-column layout in the record type and purpose sections may fragment reading order. The acknowledgment section is a single dense paragraph of legal boilerplate rather than numbered, digestible points.

Positive document features include email as a delivery option (alongside fax, mail, and pickup), preset date range options ("Last 12 months" / "Last 24 months"), and a comprehensive list of 10 named record categories. The form is concise at one page. However, it contains a misspelled heading ("AKNOWLEDGEMENT") and inconsistent ZIP codes between the form body and footer (65101 vs. 65110).

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate. This creates a procedural barrier, particularly for patients completing the form at home. The sensitive records clause bundles all sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing) into a single all-or-nothing authorization without granular opt-in/opt-out, which may conflict with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records. The 2025 form does not mention fees, leaving the cost question ambiguous; the older 2023 version references potential copying costs. No notarization is required. Submission can be done via fax or email, so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: Extremely easy findability; concise one-page form; email as a delivery option (uncommon among ROI forms); preset date range options reduce friction; comprehensive record type selection; non-conditioning and revocation language included.

**Weaknesses**: No dedicated patient access pathway — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization form; no fillable PDF fields despite being digitally created; witness requirement adds unnecessary friction; sensitive records bundling; typos and address inconsistencies in the form; no HIPAA Right of Access language; no response time commitment in the 2025 version (the 2023 version mentions 30 days).

## Overall Assessment

CHCCMO makes its ROI form easy to find and keeps it concise, but the form itself reflects a provider-centric rather than patient-centric design philosophy. It treats all records requests — whether from patients, insurers, attorneys, or other providers — identically through a generic authorization form. The lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, and the absence of any Right of Access language mean that a patient requesting their own records faces unnecessary friction and receives no acknowledgment that this is a right, not a favor. The organization earns credit for easy findability and electronic submission options, but falls short on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and compliance hygiene.

# Minnie Hamilton Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Minnie Hamilton Health System (MHHS) is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Grantsville, West Virginia, affiliated with Mon Health. The organization does not publish any downloadable ROI or patient access form on its website. Instead, it directs all medical records requests through ChartRequest, a third-party online portal. Two documents were downloaded during this evaluation: a patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) and a Mon Health Medical Center authorization form (form-2.pdf) from the affiliate system — neither is an MHHS-branded records request form.

## Access Pathway

MHHS routes patients to ChartRequest (https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville) for medical records requests. This is an online portal where the authorization form is embedded in the electronic workflow. While portal-based submission is inherently electronic and potentially convenient, ChartRequest requires account creation before a patient can even see the authorization form or understand the terms of the request. This creates opacity — patients cannot preview the form, understand fee structures, or assess what information they'll need to provide before committing to a third-party account.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ChartRequest portal appears to be a general records release platform, not a pathway specifically designed for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. There is no publicly visible indication that MHHS has a separate, streamlined process for patients requesting their own records.

MHHS also maintains an Athena Health patient portal for clinical messaging, but the only downloaded document about it (form-1.pdf) covers sending documents *to* providers — the opposite direction of a records request. Whether a patient could request records through a portal message is unclear; the website directs records requests exclusively through ChartRequest.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding records request information for MHHS was **hard**. An extensive search process — multiple query variations, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine CDX API queries, and direct website navigation — failed to surface any downloadable ROI form. The MHHS website has no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. The website does link to ChartRequest from the patients page, but there is no standalone form to evaluate. The Mon Health authorization form (form-2.pdf) was located only by broadening the search to the affiliate system and is branded exclusively for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — a separate facility approximately 150 miles away.

## Form Document Quality

Because MHHS does not publish a standalone form, there is no primary form to assess for document quality in the traditional sense. The ChartRequest portal workflow could not be evaluated without creating an account. The Mon Health form (form-2.pdf), while not applicable to MHHS, provides the closest reference point: it is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) with dense content, a 4.1 MB file size (extremely bloated with 40 embedded images and 107 fonts), and no instructions for patients. It is a generic third-party authorization form that includes "Personal Use" as one purpose option but is not designed around patient self-access.

The patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) is well-written with numbered steps and plain language, suggesting MHHS is capable of producing clear patient-facing materials — but this capability was not applied to the records request process.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The primary barrier is **gatekeeping behind account creation**. Patients must create a ChartRequest account before they can access the authorization form or learn anything about the records request process. For patients with limited internet access or digital literacy — a real concern in rural Grantsville, WV — this is a significant obstacle. There is no phone-based or paper-based alternative publicly documented on the website, though the medical records department phone number (304-354-9700, ext. 2521) is listed.

No fee information is publicly available. No response time commitment is published. No patient rights information is accessible before engaging with the ChartRequest platform. The lack of any publicly visible authorization terms means patients cannot make informed decisions about the process before entering it.

## Strengths

- **Electronic submission pathway**: The ChartRequest portal provides a fully digital workflow, eliminating the need for printing, faxing, or mailing paper forms.
- **Digital-first approach**: MHHS has adopted modern platforms (Athena Health portal, ChartRequest) rather than relying solely on paper-based processes.
- **Clear instructional writing**: The patient portal guide demonstrates an ability to produce accessible, well-structured patient materials.

## Overall Assessment

Minnie Hamilton Health System presents a paradox: it has adopted a modern electronic records request platform, but in doing so has made the process less transparent and less accessible than many organizations that simply post a PDF form. The complete absence of a publicly available authorization form, fee schedule, timeline, or patient rights information means that MHHS patients enter the records request process with no visibility into what to expect. The reliance on a third-party platform with mandatory account creation creates an unnecessary gatekeeping barrier, particularly problematic for a rural critical access hospital serving a population that may have limited internet access. While the ChartRequest workflow may be well-designed internally, the opaque exterior facing patients undermines what could otherwise be a modern, patient-friendly approach.

# HopeHealth (Florence, SC) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

HopeHealth is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Florence, South Carolina. The organization has fully outsourced its medical records release process to HealthMark Group, a third-party vendor. No HopeHealth-branded ROI or authorization form exists as a publicly downloadable document. Instead, the organization's medical records page directs patients exclusively to HealthMark's online Request Manager portal.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved during the evaluation:

1. **form-1.pdf** — HopeHealth's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP). This is an informational document, not an authorization or request form. It mentions patients' right to access records but provides no actionable mechanism beyond directing them to the Privacy Officer's contact information.

2. **form-2.pdf** — A generic HealthMark Group Medical Records Release Authorization form. This was found on HealthMark's parent company website (hmutx.com), *not* on HopeHealth's website. It is unbranded and could apply to any HealthMark client facility.

The **primary pathway** for a patient is the HealthMark Request Manager online portal, linked from HopeHealth's medical records page at `https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/`. This portal requires email verification to initiate a request.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

HopeHealth does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The generic HealthMark form lists "Patient Request" as one of six purposes alongside Attorney, Insurance, Disability, and Referring Physician — treating patient access as a flavor of general disclosure rather than a distinct legal right under HIPAA § 164.524. The form cites § 164.508 (authorization for disclosure) throughout, which is the wrong legal framework for individual right-of-access requests. It is unknown whether the HealthMark portal differentiates these pathways internally, as the portal could not be accessed without email verification.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was **hard**. Extensive web searches, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine checks, and HTML source inspection failed to locate any HopeHealth-specific authorization form. Search results were complicated by name confusion with Hope Health Ellis County, TX (a different organization). The HealthMark portal is gated behind email verification, making it impossible to evaluate the actual request workflow or any forms within it. The Wayback Machine confirmed this portal-only approach has been consistent since at least 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The generic HealthMark form (form-2.pdf) is a digitally-created single-page PDF but has **no fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite or use annotation tools. It contains approximately 15 data fields and 11 record-type checkboxes. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (recipient → patient → dates → records → purpose → acknowledgments → signature), but the content is dense, with inline CFR citations and legal language that would challenge many patients. There are no instructions for completion, no statement of patient rights, and no options for how records should be delivered.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are not disclosed anywhere — neither on the form, the NPP, nor the medical records page. The generic form imposes a fixed 180-day expiration on the authorization, which would not apply to a § 164.524 access request. The NPP contains a notable typo: the Privacy Officer's email is listed as `HIPPA@hope-health.org` (misspelling HIPAA), which could undermine patient confidence and cause email delivery issues.

## Strengths

The decision to outsource to an online portal (HealthMark Group) is conceptually a strength — it provides a digital pathway that avoids requiring patients to download, print, and mail forms. The NPP, while dense, includes concrete patient-friendly examples of permitted uses and addresses substance use disorder protections. The generic form offers granular record-type selection with 11 categories.

## Overall Assessment

HopeHealth's approach is a mixed bag. The online portal represents a modern, potentially patient-friendly pathway, but the organization provides no transparency about what that portal experience entails. There is no downloadable form for patients who prefer a traditional approach, no fee disclosure, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The available documentation (NPP and generic form) has quality issues including dense legalese, wrong HIPAA citations, and a notable typo. A patient navigating this system would find their way to the portal with moderate effort but would encounter opacity about the process, fees, and timeline.

# Barnes-Jewish Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJC HealthCare system) provides two distinct PDF forms on its Medical Records Requests page. **Form-1** is a dedicated patient access form titled "REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION BY INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS," designed exclusively for patients requesting their own records. **Form-2** is a general "Authorization For Release Of Information" form for third-party disclosures — attorneys, insurers, other providers. The website clearly separates these use cases, also listing links for next-of-kin requests, amendment requests, and Care Everywhere revocation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

This is where Barnes-Jewish stands out. Having a **dedicated patient self-access form** distinct from the third-party authorization is a genuine best practice that few organizations implement. The website's Medical Records Requests page explicitly categorizes "Individual requests" separately from "Third-party requests," so a patient arriving at the page sees an unambiguous path to the right form. The patient access form (revised 05/2022) uses right-of-access framing rather than authorization language — the patient is "requesting access" to their PHI, not "authorizing release." This is the correct legal framing under HIPAA § 164.524 and avoids confusing patients with irrelevant third-party authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The official website has a well-organized page at `/Patients-Visitors/Medical-Records-Requests` with direct PDF download links — no login, portal, or intermediary steps required. Standard web searches surfaced the page quickly. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. One potential source of confusion: the page notes that Washington University maintains separate medical records for WashU Clinic patients, which could leave some patients unsure whether they're requesting from the right entity.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF — admirably concise. It follows a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection (20 checkboxes) → date range → delivery preferences → signature → processing information. The "Abstract (includes all * documents)" checkbox is a clever shortcut — patients who want a comprehensive record can check one box instead of thirteen individual starred items. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery via email, a forward-thinking feature for a 2022 revision.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). Patients must print and fill by hand, then submit via fax (314-747-7211) or mail. This is the primary weakness: a form revised in 2022 should have interactive PDF fields as a basic digital accessibility expectation. The form does have a clean text layer, so annotation tools could work as a workaround, but it was not designed for that workflow.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes minimal barriers. No notarization or witness is required — just a patient signature and date. Fees are described in HIPAA-compliant language ("based on the cost of the labor and supplies"), though no specific fee schedule or estimate is provided. The 30-day response time is clearly stated, matching the HIPAA-mandated timeline, with a note about possible extensions.

The main red flag is the **Social Security Number request**. While the form offers "or last 4 digits" as an alternative, placing the full SSN as the primary ask collects more sensitive PII than necessary — a medical record number or date of birth should suffice. This is an unnecessary privacy risk in a patient access context.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party release — a best practice
- **Single-page design** that accomplishes a complete request without overwhelming the patient
- **Electronic delivery option** via email, with a dedicated field
- **"Abstract" checkbox** that bundles comprehensive records into one selection
- **Clear, plain-language** processing instructions with 30-day timeline

## Overall Assessment

Barnes-Jewish Hospital demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its records request process. The decision to create a dedicated patient access form — shorter, simpler, and legally distinct from the third-party authorization — reflects genuine attention to the patient experience. The website organization is exemplary. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a print-and-handwrite workflow despite the form being digitally authored. With interactive fields added, this would be a near-ideal patient access pathway. As it stands, the experience is good but not fully digital-first.

# AdventHealth Central Texas — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Central Texas is a nonprofit community hospital in Killeen, TX, part of the major AdventHealth system. Two ROI forms were found: a system-wide authorization form (form-1, ADV-800003A, rev. 2022) and a facility-specific "Request For Access And Authorization" form (form-2, AHCT 616, rev. 2005). Both were easily discoverable via web search, downloaded directly from the AdventHealth CDN with no barriers.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The facility-specific form (form-2) is the more relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. It explicitly includes a checkbox for "Provide me with access to the protected health information specified below" as its first option — a clear patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party disclosure. The system-wide form (form-1), by contrast, is architecturally a third-party disclosure form that funnels all requests through a "Disclose To" entity-naming structure. While it lists "Personal Use" as a purpose, a patient would need to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient.

The existence of both forms creates a "which form?" problem. Neither form references the other, and no landing page was found that explains when to use which. A patient could reasonably download the system-wide form first and never discover the more patient-friendly facility-specific version. That said, the facility-specific form does meaningfully differentiate patient access from third-party release — it presents four distinct action options (access, copies, disclosure to others, summary) rather than treating everything as a third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search for "AdventHealth Central Texas authorization release health information medical records form PDF" surfaced both PDFs immediately. No bot blocking, login walls, or navigation mazes were encountered. The forms are hosted on AdventHealth's CDN at direct URLs. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — full marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are digitally created PDFs with extractable text — neither is a scan. However, **neither form has any fillable/interactive fields** (both have zero fillable fields per metadata). Every field must be completed by hand after printing. This is a significant gap, especially for the system-wide form revised as recently as 2022. The "Affix Patient Label Here" boxes on form-2 further signal a paper-first, in-facility design never adapted for remote digital use.

Form-2 (the primary patient access form) is 2 pages with approximately 20–25 fields. The first page is reasonably organized: action checkboxes, patient demographics, record type selection (12 categories plus catch-alls), and a disclosure recipient section. The second page is a dense block of legal "I understand..." statements followed by signature blocks. The legal language is moderately formal but comprehensible. However, the lack of bullet points or visual separation in the legal text makes it harder to parse.

The system-wide form (form-1) is more complex, with 12 numbered sections spanning 48+ checkbox options across medical/surgical and behavioral health record types. It is visually overwhelming for a routine records request.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-2 requires a witness signature for all requests — not just behavioral health records. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access, making this an unnecessary barrier for patients completing the form at home.

**Fees**: Form-2 mentions a "reasonable, cost-based fee" but provides no specific amounts or fee schedule. The summary option pre-fills a blank for cost, setting an expectation of charges without transparency.

**90-day authorization cap**: Form-2 limits authorization to a maximum of 90 days, which is restrictive and conflates patient access requests (which don't require authorization under HIPAA) with third-party disclosure authorization.

**Wrong state law**: Form-1 references the "Illinois Mental Health and Development Disabilities Confidentiality Act" despite being served at a Texas facility — a clear legal citation error from a system-wide template not adapted for local jurisdiction.

**No notarization required**: Neither form requires notarization. Submission can be done by fax (254-526-7134) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit patient access pathway**: Form-2's first checkbox is "Provide me with access to the protected health information" — a rarity that centers patient self-access.
- **Broad catch-all category**: Form-2 includes "Any other personally identifiable information used by AdventHealth Central Texas to make medical decisions about me" — an unusually expansive request option.
- **Local contact information**: Form-2 provides facility-specific phone and fax numbers, unlike the generic system form.
- **Secure email delivery option**: Form-1 offers secure email as a delivery method, more progressive than fax-only alternatives.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: Both forms correctly state that refusing to sign will not affect treatment or benefits.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Central Texas offers a mixed experience. On the positive side, the facility-specific form includes genuine patient access language and the forms are trivially easy to find online. On the negative side, neither form is fillable, the facility form is over 20 years old, a witness signature creates unnecessary friction, and the two-form landscape creates confusion about which to use. The organization earns credit for having a patient access pathway at all — many peers offer only generic third-party authorization forms — but the execution falls short of modern standards for digital accessibility and form hygiene.

# Good Samaritan Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Good Samaritan Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in West Palm Beach, FL, operated under the Palm Beach Health Network (PBHN), itself part of Tenet Healthcare. The facility offers two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records release — an older facility-specific version (form-1, dated 2014) and a newer network-wide version (form-2, dated 2020). Records requests are processed through Datavant, a third-party ROI vendor, with email submission available. The parent system's medical records page also offers the form in Spanish and Haitian Creole.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

Good Samaritan does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — standard third-party disclosure authorization forms. A patient requesting their own records must name themselves as the "RECIPIENT" (the field asks for "person(s) to whom [the facility] may disclose my health information") and check "Personal Use" under the PURPOSE section. This is functional but unintuitive; the form was clearly designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties, not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. Neither form references the right of access, offers format options for records delivery, or distinguishes self-access from third-party release in any meaningful way.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately surfaced a direct link to form-1 on the hospital's website, and the parent PBHN medical records page linked to form-2 along with Spanish and Haitian Creole versions. However, Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic download, requiring browser-based workarounds. For a typical patient using a browser, this would not be an issue. One source of confusion: both the older facility form and the newer network form are published simultaneously with no guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2, the 2020 network version) is a 2-page print-and-fill PDF with **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring handwriting. The form follows a logical structure — facility selection, demographics, record type checkboxes (20 categories), recipient, term, purpose, super-confidential categories — but is visually dense with small fonts. Notably, form-2 exposes raw mail-merge placeholders in the sidebar (`«PatientNumber»`, `«PatientName»`, `«BirthDate»`, etc.) that are meaningless to patients and appear unprofessional. The form also references a Privacy Office address "listed below" that does not actually appear anywhere on the document — a broken internal reference that prevents patients from exercising their right to revoke authorization.

The language is moderately legalistic. The legal paragraphs on redisclosure, revocation, and treatment conditioning are standard healthcare boilerplate but lack plain-language explanation. The form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for HIPAA identity verification and creates data security risk on a form transmitted via fax or mail.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit via fax (561-650-6467, listed on form-1), email to Datavant (SM-Tenetgoodsamaritan@Datavant.com, per retrieval notes), mail, or in-person pickup. The availability of fax and email means patients are not forced to physically visit the facility, which meets the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers:** SSN collection is unnecessary and potentially deterrent. No fees are disclosed — patients have no visibility into costs before submitting. The form's lack of fillable fields means the entire completion process is paper-based. Form-2 is missing Privacy Office contact information, and its omission of the remuneration disclosure present in form-1 raises compliance questions given Datavant's involvement.

**Bright spots:** Multilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is a genuine strength for the Palm Beach community. The 20+ record-type checkboxes give patients granular control over what is disclosed. Flexible authorization term options (specific date, until fulfilled, until event, until withdrawn) are well-designed. The super-confidential information section on page 2 properly handles Florida state law and 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for sensitive health information categories.

## Overall Assessment

Good Samaritan Medical Center provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all requestors — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access. The forms lack digital fillability, contain confusing internal system artifacts, and collect unnecessary personal information. While multilingual availability and granular record selection are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects a process designed around institutional workflow rather than patient needs. Grade: **C**.

# Barrett Hospital & HealthCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Barrett Hospital & HealthCare is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Dillon, Montana. The organization offers a single pathway for patients requesting their medical records: a one-page PDF authorization form linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page on its Wix-hosted website. Only one form was found during the retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Barrett Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole form — titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios, including inter-provider transfers, third-party releases, and patient access. The form includes dual "RECEIVE from" / "RELEASE to" fields, a compensation disclosure clause, and language about conditioning treatment on signing — elements that are appropriate for third-party authorizations but inappropriate and potentially confusing when a patient is simply exercising their HIPAA right of access under § 164.524. There is no mention of patient access rights anywhere on the form.

The "Purpose" field does include "Personal Use" as a circled option, which is the closest the form comes to acknowledging patient self-access. However, this is a single option among several on a general-purpose form, not a dedicated pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search quickly identified the "Request Medical Records" page, which features a clearly labeled download link. For a small rural critical access hospital, this level of web accessibility is commendable — many larger organizations make their forms harder to find. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **natively digital PDF but not fillable** — it has zero interactive form fields. Patients must print, handwrite their responses on blank lines, and return the form via fax, mail, or in-person pickup. The "circle one" instructions for format and delivery options confirm the print-and-handwrite design intent.

Despite the non-fillable limitation, the form is well-organized and concise at a single page. It follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → date ranges → format/delivery → legal notices → signature. The record-type section uses an efficient tabular layout with per-category date ranges. The turnaround time ("10 days") is stated prominently at the top — a practice many organizations neglect entirely.

The language is mostly plain, though the legal paragraphs at the bottom are denser. The "Initial" column in the record-type table is ambiguous — patients are apparently expected to initial next to each record type they want, but this is never explained. The abbreviation "Disc" next to imaging options is also cryptic.

The form collects last four digits of SSN, which is unnecessary under HIPAA for identity verification and may deter some patients. Delivery options include pick up, fax, and mail — fax qualifies as an electronic submission pathway per our scoring baseline, so the organization meets the minimum for remote submission.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant compliance issue is the conditioning language: "I understand that I may refuse this authorization and that my refusal to sign may affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment or my eligibility for benefits." Under HIPAA § 164.524, providers cannot condition treatment on a patient's willingness to authorize access to their own records. Because this dual-purpose form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release, this problematic language is presented to all requestors regardless of context.

The compensation disclosure clause ("I understand that _____ will receive compensation for its use/disclosure of the information") is similarly irrelevant for patient access requests and adds confusion. No fee schedule is disclosed on the form or the website's medical records page.

## Strengths

- **Easy findability** with a dedicated medical records page and clear download link

## Overall Assessment

Barrett Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of small independent hospitals. The form is easy to find, reasonably organized, and concise, but it is a generic third-party authorization form repurposed for all disclosure purposes — including patient self-access — without any differentiation. The non-fillable PDF and conditioning language are the most notable shortcomings. For a critical access hospital with limited resources, the web presence and form accessibility are respectable, but the organization misses the mark on patient-centeredness by failing to treat individual access as distinct from third-party release.
