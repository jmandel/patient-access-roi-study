You are analyzing ROI form retrieval results for a study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city). Use this to contextualize your findings by org type.

Your task: identify the most significant barriers patients would face when trying to
request their records from organizations in this batch. Look for:
- Difficulty finding the form
- Burdensome requirements imposed on patients
- Poor technical accessibility
- Anything that would frustrate or discourage a patient

Write your findings to "output.md". For each barrier:
- Name the organization and describe the problem
- Explain the impact on patients
- Note whether this seems like an oversight or a pattern

End with a brief summary of barrier patterns across this batch.
Keep to 500-1000 words.

# Olmsted Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Olmsted Medical Center (OMC) is an independent nonprofit physician practice in Rochester, MN. Two forms were found on the organization's website: a primary "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (form-1) and a companion "Authorization for Allowing Verbal Communication of Protected Health Information" (form-2). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records; form-2 is limited to authorizing verbal discussions with a designated person and explicitly disclaims any written record release.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

OMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. The primary form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, employers, and others. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this generic form: they fill in OMC's address in the "Release Information From" field (pre-populated) and put their own name and address in the "Release Information To" field. The form includes a "Personal" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which at least provides a recognizable option, but there is no guidance text explaining how a patient should complete the form for self-access specifically. The form does not differentiate between individual access rights under § 164.524 and third-party authorization under § 164.508.

That said, the form does reference "CRF 164.524" (a typo for CFR) and includes a strong non-conditioning statement — both patient-protective elements that go beyond what many generic authorization forms include.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. OMC hosts a dedicated "Manage Your Health Information" page accessible through clear website navigation (Patients & Visitors > Your Care & Visit > Manage Your Health Information). Multiple search strategies — filetype:pdf queries, site-scoped searches, and direct navigation — all led to the form quickly. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot blocking, which prevented programmatic downloads via curl but would not affect a patient using a browser. The page also lists Spanish and Somali translations, MyChart proxy access forms, and the verbal communication authorization form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **62 interactive form fields** — a truly digital-first design, not a scan or print-only document. The layout uses a clean left-column label / right-column field structure with clearly delineated sections: patient demographics, release from/to, method of disclosure, date range, record type selection (a granular checkbox grid), reason for release, authorization/expiration, revocation rights, and signature. The language is mostly plain and functional, though the opening line — "This is a legal document" — may intimidate some patients. The authorization section includes standard but dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation.

Delivery options include mail, pick up, fax (marked "Urgent Only — limitations may apply"), and patient portal (also with "limitations may apply"). The inclusion of patient portal delivery is a positive signal, though the unexplained "limitations" qualifiers create uncertainty. Submission methods include any OMC location, postal mail, or fax (507.287.2777), with a phone number for questions. Fax availability means a patient can submit without visiting in person or relying on postal mail.

## Barriers and Compliance

OMC imposes no unusual barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no upfront fee disclosure. The one-year default authorization expiration is standard. Revocation rights are clearly stated and require written notice to the Health Information Department. The form explicitly references the patient's right to inspect or receive copies under CFR 164.524 and states that OMC will not condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility on signing the authorization — a strong compliance posture.

Minor issues include two typos ("CRF" for "CFR" and "provide" for "provided"), an inconsistent mailing address between form-1 and form-2, and the unexplained "limitations may apply" qualifiers on fax and portal delivery. The "File Only — No Records Needed at this time" option in the delivery section is an internal administrative option that may confuse patients.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in English, Spanish, and Somali — the Somali translation is notably community-responsive for Rochester, MN
- **62 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive digital form, uncommon in healthcare ROI
- **Patient portal delivery option** alongside traditional methods
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference** and non-conditioning statement — unusually transparent about patient rights
- **Clean single-page design** that fits comprehensive content without feeling cramped

## Overall Assessment

Olmsted Medical Center delivers a technically strong, well-organized, and accessible ROI form that is easy to find and free of significant barriers. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must use a generic third-party authorization form and figure out how to adapt it for their own purposes. Despite this, the form's quality, fillability, multilingual support, and compliance posture make it a solid option for patients. The organization earns a **B** grade: strong document quality and accessibility, held back by the generic-form-for-all-purposes approach to patient access.

# Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph offers two versions of the same general-purpose ROI authorization form (Form #3014) linked from different pages of its website. Form-1 (dated 03/28/2019) is the current version, found on the Health Information Management page under "Authorizations and Forms." Form-2 (dated 11/24/2015) is an older version linked from the Privacy Policy > HIPAA Authorization Form page. Both are flat (non-fillable) PDFs. A third version in .docx format with entirely outdated "Heartland Health" branding was also discoverable via web search. The organization additionally uses Epic MyChart as a patient portal, though the ROI forms make no mention of it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mosaic Life Care does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both form versions are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request to Another Agency," framing the process as a release of records to a third party. A patient wanting their own records must fill in themselves as both the requesting party and the recipient. While "Personal" appears among 12 purpose options, there is no language, section, or streamlined flow that addresses HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) as a distinct use case. The form does not reference the Right of Access by name, does not explain associated timelines or fee limits, and does not mention the patient portal as an alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were relatively easy to find — 2–3 clicks from the homepage via the HIM page. Site-specific search also surfaced the relevant pages. The main complication is fragmentation: two versions of the same form (same form number) are published simultaneously on different pages with no indication of which supersedes the other. This creates a risk that patients encounter the outdated 2015 version, which still references the organization's former name ("Heartland Regional Medical Center") in its legal disclaimer.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) has a text layer and is not a scan, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore placeholders, requiring the patient to print and handwrite responses. The 2-page form follows a logical flow (demographics → source facility → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature) and uses a two-column layout that makes efficient use of space. The 13-category record type checklist with an "Other" option provides granular control over what is released. However, the language mixes plain and legal styles, with the deceased-patient section and legal disclaimers being notably dense. The form requires a purpose selection ("must select one"), which is not required under HIPAA for patient self-access requests.

## Barriers and Notable Issues

No notarization is required. Forms can be submitted via email (ROI@myMLC.com), fax, or mail — multiple electronic submission channels are available, and in-person delivery is not required. However, form-1 says nothing about fees, while the older form-2 vaguely mentions records "may be subject to copying fees" without specifying amounts or HIPAA fee limits. No response time commitment is stated. The mandatory purpose field is a potential compliance concern for patient self-access requests. An "Identification type / Verified by" line on the form could mislead patients into thinking in-person ID verification is required, though the form can be submitted remotely.

## Strengths

The standout bright spot is the 15-language assistance notice on page 2 of form-1, covering an unusually comprehensive set of languages including Pennsylvania Dutch and Trukese — reflecting attention to local community demographics. The granular record type selection and multiple submission channels (email, fax, mail) are also positive features.

## Overall Assessment

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph provides a reasonably findable but fundamentally paper-oriented ROI process that funnels all requesters — including patients seeking their own records — through a generic third-party release authorization. The form quality is adequate with logical organization and good scope controls, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and missing fee/timeline information limit patient-centeredness. The organization earns a **C grade**, reflecting an acceptable but unremarkable approach to patient record access that meets minimum requirements without demonstrating meaningful investment in the patient self-access experience.

# WakeMed Health & Hospitals — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

WakeMed Health & Hospitals provides a single ROI authorization form ("Authorization to Release Medical Information," N-935, revised 11/25) available in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf, N-935S). These are the same form translated — not separate documents for different purposes. Both are linked from the Health Information Management (HIM) page under Patients and Visitors → Medical Records. There is no online portal, no web-based request wizard, and no dedicated patient-access form. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it by hand, and submitting via email (HIMROI@Wakemed.org), fax (919-350-1720), or mail.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

WakeMed does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization that covers both releasing and obtaining PHI. A patient requesting their own records selects "Personal" from a list of five purposes (Billing/Insurance, Patient Care, Personal, Legal, Other) and must fill in a "Recipient" field — a concept that doesn't map cleanly when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form asks for the name of the "Person, Organization, or Facility you want us to release your PHI to," which creates an awkward fit for a simple "send me my records" request. This is a generic_hipaa_auth pathway, not a patient-centric design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A web search for WakeMed's ROI authorization immediately surfaced the correct page. The only friction was that an older URL (/assets/documents/...) was stale and returned HTML, requiring navigation to the HIM page to locate the current PDF links under /sites/default/files/pdf/. Once there, both language versions are clearly labeled and downloadable without bot blocking or access restrictions. Difficulty: moderate — easy via search, but required one redirect.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. Checkboxes are rendered as the letter "o" in text, and blanks are underscores — a purely print-and-handwrite design. The form has a text layer (not an image scan), so the content is readable on screen, but a patient cannot complete it digitally without third-party annotation tools.

Layout and organization are strong points. The 2-page form flows logically: patient/recipient information → record types and date ranges → format and delivery preferences (page 1), then understanding/consent → authorization/signature → revocation → contact information (page 2). Section headers are bold and uppercase. Record type selection is granular, with specific options for office visits, hospital admissions, ED visits, imaging studies, and sub-components like discharge summaries and lab reports. The date-of-visit field is flexibly worded ("Specify the date, date range, or other specific description of your visit").

Language is reasonably plain, though the UNDERSTANDING section on page 2 leans toward legal formality with a series of "I understand..." statements. These are necessary disclosures (re-disclosure risk, revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment) but add density.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No unnecessary barriers**: No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission. Multiple electronic submission channels (email and fax). Identity verification is mentioned but framed permissively ("proof of my identity... may be requested").

**Fee disclosure is vague**: The form warns that "any and/or all" requests and large-volume requests are processed by WakeMed's copy service and "a fee will be charged," but provides no schedule, estimate, or reference to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based standard. A patient cannot predict costs before submitting.

**Notable bright spots**: (1) A Spanish-language version exists — uncommon in this study — though it has translation gaps, with key field labels ("Address where you want your PHI sent to," "Email address") remaining in English. (2) Six delivery methods are offered: mail, fax, pick up, onsite review, MyChart (for records after 2/1/2015), and email with encrypted delivery as the default. (3) Email submission of the form itself removes a significant access barrier. (4) The form was recently revised (11/25), suggesting active maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

WakeMed provides a competent, well-organized ROI form with multiple submission and delivery channels, a Spanish translation, and no major procedural barriers. Its primary weakness is the lack of a patient-centric access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization form designed for all disclosure purposes, and the non-fillable PDF format forces a print-and-handwrite workflow. The form is adequate for its purpose but falls short of best practice in digital accessibility and patient-centeredness. Grade: **B** (3.50).

# Flowers Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Flowers Hospital in Dothan, Alabama, is a 235-bed for-profit community hospital owned by Triad of Alabama LLC and operating within the Community Health Systems (CHS) network. Three documents were retrieved: the hospital's official "Patient Request for Health Information" form (HIM-1406) in both English (form-2.pdf) and Spanish (form-3.pdf), plus an incidental release form from Wiregrass Surgical Associates, an affiliated practice housed at the hospital's Doctor's Center (form-1.pdf). The primary form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, the English HIM-1406.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated and Patient-Centered

Flowers Hospital provides a genuinely patient-centered access pathway. The official form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" — not "Authorization for Release" or "HIPAA Disclosure Form" — framing the interaction around the patient's own right of access. The form's recipient section lists "Myself" as the first option, with "Personal Representative" and "Other Third Party" as secondary choices. This clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release within a single, well-structured document.

Beyond the PDF, the hospital's medical records page offers an online request portal via Swellbox, providing a fully digital submission alternative. Between the fillable PDF (submittable via fax or mail) and the Swellbox portal, patients have multiple electronic submission options — no in-person visit or postal mail is required.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's website has a "Request Medical Records" page accessible from the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation. That page links directly to both the English and Spanish PDF forms and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative searching was needed. This is a model of how a hospital should surface its records request process.

## Form Document Quality

The HIM-1406 form is a single-page, digitally-designed PDF created in Adobe InDesign with 66 fillable AcroForm fields — an impressive level of interactivity for a one-page form. Every text input, checkbox, and selection area is digitally fillable, allowing patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing.

The form follows a logical seven-section flow: patient demographics, facility identification, record type selection (13 checkboxes including "Entire Record"), sensitive information opt-in (5 categories covering substance abuse, HIV, genetics, and psychiatric records), delivery method, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and accessible throughout. Five delivery methods are offered: paper, email (with appropriate risk disclosure), removable media (with password-protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media option with a password-protection toggle is an unusually thoughtful feature.

The Spanish version (HIM-1406S) is a complete, professional translation with identical structure and field count, linked co-equally alongside the English form — not a machine-generated afterthought.

## Barriers and Concerns

No significant barriers exist. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, and no excessive fee schedule. The form does include a witness signature field whose status as required or optional is ambiguous — this could deter patients completing the form at home. The fee disclosure is vague ("There may be charges associated with processing a request"), giving patients no way to estimate costs upfront. While not affirmatively problematic, greater fee transparency would better serve patients.

The form begins with an unexplained "*ROI*" header (internal jargon for "Release of Information") and the fillable fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader accessibility. The footer on the Spanish form remains in English — a minor inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

Flowers Hospital represents a strong example of patient-centered records access. The dedicated patient access form with "Myself" as the primary option, the comprehensive fillable PDF, the co-equal Spanish translation, the Swellbox portal alternative, and the easy findability from the main website all demonstrate genuine attention to the patient experience. The minor issues — ambiguous witness field, vague fee language, accessibility gaps — prevent a perfect score but do not materially impede a patient requesting their own records. This organization earns a grade of **A**.

# Bath Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Bath Community Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Hot Springs, Virginia. The organization offers a single ROI form for medical records requests, hosted on its website. No patient portal, online request wizard, or alternative digital pathway was identified.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a one-page "Request of Information" PDF (`form-1.pdf`) branded under **Bath Community Physicians Group** rather than Bath Community Hospital itself. This branding mismatch is common among small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative infrastructure. The form is hosted on the hospital's website at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf` and linked from the Patient Resources → Forms page.

The form is a generic release-of-information authorization — it uses a "Send / Receive" and "To / From" structure designed primarily for inter-provider record transfers, not for patient self-access. A patient wanting their own records would need to adapt the form by marking "Send" and writing in their own name and address as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA individual access rights, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. A targeted web search surfaced the PDF directly, and the hospital's website links to it from a clearly labeled "Medical Records Request" section under Patient Resources. The URL path is descriptive. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. For a small critical access hospital, the form is reasonably discoverable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **scanned paper document** with an OCR text layer — not a digitally-created or fillable PDF. Despite metadata suggesting 21 fillable fields, the field names are empty and the form functions as a flat scan that must be printed and completed by hand. The OCR layer contains numerous errors ("ERNOTE," "LABffEST RESULTS," "IMAGINE REPORTS," "DISHCHARGE SUMMARY"), rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers and text-based search tools.

At one page with approximately 15 patient-completed fields, the form is appropriately brief. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → authorization direction → destination → reason → record type selection → signature block. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records consent paragraph is somewhat dense. No instructions are provided for how to complete or submit the form.

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access requests. This creates a real barrier — a patient must find someone to witness their signature before submitting. The form also requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, raising privacy concerns for a document that may be faxed.

No fees are mentioned. No response time commitment is stated. Submission instructions are absent; the header includes a fax number (540-962-7881), suggesting fax is an available submission method, but this is not explicitly stated. No in-person-only requirement is stated, so fax submission appears available.

## Notable Strengths

The form correctly separates consent for alcohol/drug abuse and psychiatric records into a dedicated checkbox — proper 42 CFR Part 2 practice that many organizations neglect. It also includes a checkbox for patients to request a copy of their signed authorization, a HIPAA requirement that many forms omit.

## Overall Assessment

Bath Community Hospital provides a minimally functional pathway for patients to request their records, but the experience is not patient-centered. The form was designed for provider-to-provider transfers and requires patients to adapt it for self-access. The scanned-image quality, OCR errors, witness requirement, and lack of submission instructions all create friction. While the form is findable and brief, it reflects an older, paper-first approach to health information management typical of small independent facilities. A patient could complete the process, but would receive little guidance and face an unnecessary witness barrier along the way.

# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore is part of the Hillcrest HealthCare System (Ardent Health Services), and all medical records requests are handled through the parent system's centralized infrastructure. Two PDFs were downloaded during research, but only one is relevant: **form-2.pdf** is the system-wide "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (HMC1072, Rev. 08/18), which lists Hillcrest Hospital Claremore among nine facilities via checkboxes. Form-1.pdf belongs to an entirely unrelated practice — Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego, CA — and was a false-positive search result retained per study protocol.

Beyond the paper form, the system's Medical Records Request page advertises two digital pathways: **MyChart** (patient portal) and a **Swellbox** online request wizard (hosted at swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html). The paper form is thus the weakest of three available channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** clearly differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The paper form is a generic HIPAA authorization covering both disclosure *to* and receipt *from* third parties in a single document. It includes "At the request of the patient or patient's representative" as one purpose checkbox among Insurance, Continued treatment, Legal, and Other — framing patient access as merely one use case rather than a distinct right. The form makes no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

However, the availability of the Swellbox online wizard suggests the system may have a more patient-centric digital pathway. The paper form alone is clearly designed for the traditional release-of-information workflow, not individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search led directly to the system-wide Medical Records Request page at hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/, reachable in 2–3 clicks from the main website. The page clearly presents multiple pathways (MyChart, Swellbox, paper form). One minor friction point: direct searches for "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" specifically did not surface the form — a patient must navigate through or discover the parent system's centralized page.

## Form Document Quality

The paper form (form-2.pdf) is a **digitally created PDF with zero fillable fields**, forcing patients to print and handwrite all entries. This is a missed opportunity — the form was created digitally but not made interactive. The document is effectively one page of content duplicated as a carbon-copy format (page 1 for the facility, page 2 for the patient), a vestige of physical paper workflows.

The layout follows a logical flow: facility selection → patient identification → authorization body → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. However, the "I understand" section is a dense block of legalistic text with minimal visual separation. Record type options are clinically specific (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, etc.) with no "all records" or "entire medical record" checkbox. The checkbox characters extract as Khmer script (U+17A2), indicating a font-mapping issue that breaks assistive technology.

The language is **moderately legalistic**, particularly the sensitive-information acknowledgment paragraph, which is a single run-on sentence listing communicable diseases.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release the entities listed above, their agents and employees from any liability" as a condition of authorizing disclosure — not required by HIPAA and a red flag.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Normal applicable fees, such as copy fees, may apply" with no schedule or estimate.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no mailing address, fax number, or other submission method — patients must figure out delivery independently.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Patients cannot authorize general records release while excluding mental health, HIV, or substance abuse information.
- **No notarization** or witness requirement — a positive.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple request pathways**: The system offers MyChart, Swellbox online wizard, and a paper form — patients have choices.
- **System-wide form clarity**: The facility checkbox design clearly identifies which entities are covered, preventing confusion about facility-specific forms.
- **Easy findability**: The centralized Medical Records Request page is well-organized and accessible.

## Overall Assessment

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore benefits from its parent system's multi-channel approach to records requests, with digital options (MyChart and Swellbox) supplementing the paper form. However, the paper form itself — the only downloadable document — is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, legalistic language, and a problematic liability waiver. The organization earns credit for pathway availability and findability, but the form document quality and lack of patient access differentiation hold it back. A patient who only finds the paper form faces a distinctly paper-era experience; a patient who discovers the online pathways has a better route. Overall: **adequate infrastructure, mediocre form document, no patient-access differentiation**.

# Phelps Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Memorial Health Center is a small independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Holdrege, Nebraska. The organization offers a single ROI form — a one-page "Request for Release of Information" — that serves as the sole documented pathway for patients requesting their medical records. No patient portal–based request option, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway

Phelps Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization used for all purposes — releasing records to another provider, to a third party, or to the patient themselves. "Patient" appears as one of three checkbox options under "Release Records To" (alongside "Provider/Hospital" and "Other Person"), and an in-person inspection option is included, but there is no dedicated workflow or separate form for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as an attorney or insurer, selecting the applicable checkboxes and ignoring fields meant for third-party recipients.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was **easy to find via web search** — a basic query for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned a direct link to the PDF. However, the form is **not linked from the organization's patient forms page**, which only lists a Patient History Form and New Patient Form. A patient browsing the website through normal navigation would not discover the ROI form. The PDF is hosted at a raw Drupal file path with no landing page or contextual instructions.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but with zero interactive form fields. All blanks are underscored lines intended for handwriting. The form must be printed, filled out by hand, and returned via fax (two fax numbers are listed in the footer) or in person. No electronic fill-and-submit workflow exists.

**Layout and organization** are logical — the form flows top-to-bottom from patient identification through record source, recipient, purpose, record type selection, legal language, and signature. However, the single page is moderately cramped, and administrative fields ("Release completed by:", "MR #:") appear prominently at the top, potentially confusing patients who may think they need to fill them in.

**Language** is mixed: the top half uses plain, accessible phrasing with straightforward checkboxes, while the bottom half presents dense legal paragraphs covering HIPAA rights, revocation, treatment conditioning, and sensitive information disclosures. The legal text includes a factual error — citing "Health Information Portability and Accountability Act" instead of the correct "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no unreasonable barriers**: no notarization or witness required, no in-person-only submission (fax is available), and appropriate anti-conditioning language is included with a specific HIPAA citation (§ 164.508). Fee disclosure is transparent and reasonable — first 10 pages are free, $0.25/page thereafter, $10 for CD — which is more generous than many providers. The form also includes a "COMPLETE HEALTH RECORD" checkbox, simplifying requests for patients who want everything.

Concerns include the **calendar-year expiration** ("Release effective until the end of this year"), which creates an inconsistent authorization window depending on when the patient signs. The form is dated August 2017 and has not been updated in over eight years, raising questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **First 10 pages free**: Reduces cost burden for routine patient access requests.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Accomplishes a complete ROI authorization concisely.
- **"Complete Health Record" option**: Lets patients request everything without needing to select individual categories.
- **Anti-conditioning language**: Explicitly states treatment cannot be conditioned on signing.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields**: Entirely print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Not linked from website navigation**: Findable only via search engine.
- **Generic form for all purposes**: No differentiation for patient self-access.
- **HIPAA name error and outdated form**: Suggests lack of recent legal review.
- **Staff fields on patient-facing form**: "Release completed by" and "MR #" may confuse patients.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Memorial Health Center provides a functional but basic records request process. The single-page form is efficient and the fee structure is patient-friendly, but the lack of fillable fields, absence from website navigation, and failure to distinguish patient access from third-party release place this organization squarely in the middle tier. The form gets the job done but reflects a paper-era workflow that has not been updated to serve the modern patient experience. **Grade: C.**

# DHR Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

DHR Health (formerly Doctors Hospital at Renaissance) in Edinburg, TX offers a single pathway for patients requesting their medical records: a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (DSR-GEN-71, dated August 2015), available in both English and Spanish from the Medical Records page. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no online portal, and no digital submission option beyond fax. The form is over a decade old, still carries the organization's former branding, and was designed for third-party release rather than individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents are available on the DHR Health website:

1. **form-1.pdf (English)** — A 2-page authorization form with a text layer and 37 unnamed fillable fields. This is the primary form for any records request.
2. **form-2.pdf (Spanish)** — An image-only scan of the same form, produced on a Konica Minolta copier. No text layer, no functional fillable fields, and several spelling/grammar errors in the Spanish text.

Both serve identical purposes: a bidirectional authorization that can route records either from or to the hospital. The form directs patients to choose between these two directions via an "OR" structure, with no guidance on which section applies to a patient requesting their own records. Submission is by fax or mail to the Health Information Management department; no online portal, email submission, or patient portal pathway was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DHR Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same form is used whether a patient wants copies of their own chart or an attorney is requesting records. There is no streamlined pathway, no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their own records. The form asks patients to state a "purpose" for the request — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access — without clarifying that this field is optional for patients requesting their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is **2 clicks from the homepage** (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and the download links are clearly labeled in English and Spanish. However, legacy URLs from a CMS migration return empty files, meaning patients following older search engine links will get broken downloads. The current URLs use CMS hash paths but have descriptive filenames.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) has a text layer and 37 fillable field annotations, but the fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader and auto-fill functionality. The form is not truly digital-first — it appears to be a designed layout with graphical elements, subsequently exported to PDF with fields added as an afterthought. The Spanish version is materially worse: a flat image-only scan with no text layer, no searchable text, and no assistive technology support, creating a two-tier accessibility gap.

The layout uses a cramped, checkbox-heavy design with multiple columns and 16 embedded images across 2 pages. The language is legalistic but not impenetrable, though the psychiatric/substance abuse/HIV consent section is a particularly dense compound sentence that would confuse most patients. The Do/Do Not consent mechanism via initials is ambiguous in its construction.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Social Security Number required** — The form requests a full SSN with no indication it is optional, creating identity theft risk for a document submitted by fax or mail.
- **Purpose field without exemption** — Patients are asked to justify their request, which HIPAA does not require for individual access.
- **Witness signature line** on the Spanish form adds an unnecessary step.
- **Liability waiver bundled** into the authorization on the Spanish form, asking patients to release the hospital from "all legal liability and any harm" from disclosure.
- **No fee disclosure** — The form says nothing about costs for copies.
- **No expiration clause** on the English form (the Spanish version defaults to 180 days).
- **No patient rights statement** — No reference to the right to access, right to revoke, or right to electronic format.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful in the Rio Grande Valley, where ~90% of the population is Hispanic/Latino. Offering a Spanish form, despite its quality issues, is a genuine accommodation.
- **Granular record type selection** — The ~20-item checkbox list gives patients meaningful control over what they're requesting.
- **Easy website navigation** — The form is prominently placed and easy to find via the main site navigation.

## Overall Assessment

DHR Health provides the bare minimum for patient records access: a downloadable PDF authorization form that is easy to find but poorly designed for patient self-access. The form is a decade-old generic release authorization that does not acknowledge individual access rights, requires unnecessary personal information (SSN), and bundles concerning liability language. The Spanish version's image-only format creates an equity gap. The organization would benefit from a modernized, patient-centered access form — or ideally an online request portal — that separates individual access from third-party release and removes unnecessary barriers.

# Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Chandler, AZ, with eight office locations across the Phoenix metro area. Three documents were retrieved: an incoming records request form (form-1), the primary outbound ROI authorization form (form-2), and a new patient forms packet from a sister site (form-3). Only form-2 serves a patient requesting their own records from Ironwood.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Ironwood does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-2, a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" designed to serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party release, legal, insurance, and disability. The form uses a "To" and "From" field structure oriented toward third-party transfers, which can confuse patients seeking their own records. However, "Personal Use" is explicitly listed as the first purpose option, which partially signals awareness of patient self-access as a legitimate use case.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or use individual-access-specific language. A patient must navigate a form designed around third-party release and determine which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the ROI form required **moderate-to-significant effort**. The patient forms page at ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/ existed but did not expose downloadable links — possibly due to JavaScript rendering requirements or link removal. The primary ROI form (form-2) was only discoverable via site-specific search engine queries. Its URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/`) suggests it dates from March 2019 and may be effectively orphaned. Ironically, the incoming records form (form-1) was updated more recently (November 2023) and is fillable, suggesting the organization invested in making it easy for other providers to send records to Ironwood while neglecting the patient-facing release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable/interactive fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a notable gap, especially given that form-1 (the incoming records form) has 22 fillable fields. The asymmetry suggests intentional or negligent underinvestment in the patient-facing document.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → record types → date range → purpose → delivery method → legal disclosures → signatures. Seven record type categories (physician's notes, lab reports, radiology reports, biopsy reports, prescriptions, radiology imaging, plus "Other") provide reasonable granularity for a cancer center. Five delivery methods are offered: fax, secure email, mail, pick up, and patient portal — a strong set of options including two electronic channels beyond fax.

The form lacks any introductory instructions or plain-language guidance. Legal disclosures are presented in dense paragraph format on page 2, though "I UNDERSTAND THAT" headers provide some scannability. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions available.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fee disclosure is vague: "A fee may be charged for providing the protected health information" — no amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees. This ambiguity could discourage patients.

No notarization or witness signature is required. The non-conditioning statement is present and appropriate. Revocation rights are clearly stated. The authorization expires after one year, which is standard.

A notable red flag on form-1 (though not the primary patient form): the STD definition section cites Washington state law (RCW 70.24) despite Ironwood being an Arizona practice — a template-copy error that raises questions about form review diligence.

## Strengths

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: Offering secure email and patient portal alongside fax, mail, and pickup gives patients meaningful choice — better than many comparable practices.
- **"Personal Use" as an explicit purpose**: Listing this as the first purpose option is a small but meaningful signal of patient access awareness.
- **Reasonable record type granularity**: The checkbox categories are well-suited to oncology records.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable patient form vs. fillable provider form**: The clearest indicator of misaligned priorities.
- **Orphaned form**: Not linked from any active webpage; discoverable only via search engines.
- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Generic authorization for all release types.
- **Vague fee language**: Could deter patients from exercising their access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers provides a **minimally adequate** but clearly deprioritized pathway for patient self-access to records. The generic authorization form technically works for patient self-access, and the inclusion of electronic delivery options (secure email, patient portal) is a genuine strength. However, the non-fillable form, orphaned web presence, vague fee language, and lack of any patient-access-specific design collectively signal that individual record access is not a priority for this organization. A patient can get their records, but only after navigating search engines to find a form that wasn't designed for them.

# Cordova Community Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cordova Community Medical Center (CCMC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Cordova, Alaska. It offers a single Release of Information form for all medical records requests — a one-page, general-purpose HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

CCMC provides one pathway for records requests: a downloadable PDF authorization form linked from the Medical Records page at `https://www.cdvcmc.com/for-patients/medical-records/`. The form can be printed, completed by hand, and faxed to Medical Records at (907) 424-8406 or the Clinic Nurse at (907) 424-8202. No online submission portal, email submission option, or patient portal alternative exists. The website's Medical Records page reportedly discusses format options for receiving records (paper, email, CD, or fax), but the form itself does not capture a delivery format preference.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

CCMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured around "Release my information to [NAME]" — a third-party release frame. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in the recipient field and select "Personal reasons" as the purpose, which is unintuitive. The purpose checkboxes ("Continuation of care," "Insurance purposes," "Employer requirement," "Legal review") are overwhelmingly third-party scenarios. While technically usable for patient self-access, the form was clearly designed around the third-party authorization model, not individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The Medical Records page is intuitively located under "For Patients" and links directly to the form download. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, authentication, or portal login was encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a flat (non-fillable) PDF — digitally authored with a proper text layer, but with zero interactive fields. Patients must print and handwrite all entries. At one page and approximately 15 fields (patient name, DOB, MR#, recipient name/address/phone, purpose checkboxes, record type checkboxes, date range, sensitive information initial, signature, and date), the scope is reasonable. The layout uses a numbered section structure (1–7) that flows logically from authorization through scope, limitations, revocation, rights, and signature. However, the dense legal text in sections 3–7 and the redisclosure notice create a visually cramped single page. Three fonts provide some typographic hierarchy. The language shifts from accessible in the early sections to regulatory legalese in the later sections, particularly around revocation and redisclosure.

Section 2 offers excellent record-type granularity — twelve specific categories plus "Other" and date-range fields — giving patients meaningful control over what is released. Section 7's acceptance of photocopies as originals is a practical accommodation.

## Barriers

No notarization is required. Photo ID "may be required" — stated as a possibility, not an absolute mandate. No fees are mentioned on the form. The form expires three months from signature, which is short but sufficient for a single access request. There is no stated turnaround time on the form itself.

A notable concern is Section 3's all-or-nothing handling of sensitive information: alcohol/drug abuse, HIV-AIDS, mental health, and psychiatric treatment are bundled into a single initial, with an undefined "qualify above" alternative. This is problematic given the form's own citation of 42 CFR Part 2 protections for substance abuse records, which require specific consent for each disclosure.

The form's 45 CFR 164.524 citation is misapplied — used in the redisclosure context rather than to inform patients of their access rights. The form was last updated in 2016, making it nearly a decade old.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:** Excellent findability; compact single-page design; comprehensive record-type selection; photocopies accepted; fax submission available (adequate electronic pathway).

**Weaknesses:** Not fillable; does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release; sensitive information bundling; stale document (2016); delivery format not captured on form; legal language in later sections.

## Overall Assessment

CCMC provides a functional but dated records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it was designed for third-party release rather than patient self-access. The non-fillable format and print-fax workflow reflect a paper-first mindset. For a small, remote critical access hospital, the form is adequate but falls short of patient-centered design. A patient can navigate the process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary user.

# MountainView Hospital (Las Vegas, NV) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MountainView Hospital is part of HCA Healthcare's Sunrise Health network in Las Vegas. The facility's own domain (`mountainview-hospital.com`) redirects to the Sunrise Health system website at `sunrisehealthinfo.com`, where all medical records information is centralized. Two PDF forms were found—an English and Spanish version of the same standardized HCA Healthcare authorization form—alongside references to two additional digital pathways: an online Swellbox records request portal and the MyHealthONE patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The medical records page at sunrisehealthinfo.com offers three pathways for patients requesting records: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (in English and Spanish), (2) an online request wizard via Swellbox, and (3) the MyHealthONE patient portal. The primary downloadable form (form-1.pdf, HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21) is a system-wide HCA Healthcare standardized authorization used across all HCA facilities, not specific to MountainView Hospital. The Swellbox portal represents the most streamlined digital option, though the PDF form remains the most prominently linked resource.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MountainView Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves both patient self-requests and third-party release, with a radio-button choice between "At the request of the individual" and "Other 3rd party recipient." While a patient *can* use this form to request their own records, the form's framing—with prominent "Recipient" fields, fax-to-provider-only restrictions, and third-party disclosure language—is clearly oriented toward release-of-information scenarios rather than individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. The form makes no distinction between Right of Access fee limits/timelines and general authorization practices.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was relatively easy. The medical records page is accessible via the main navigation ("For Patients → Medical Records"), and the authorization forms are directly linked with clear labels. The one complication was bot protection: curl requests to the initial download URL returned HTML rather than a PDF, requiring discovery of the actual CDN URL at `hcadam.com`. This is a minor technical obstacle that wouldn't affect a patient using a browser.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a single-page, fully interactive PDF with 52 fillable fields—patients can complete it digitally without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (patient/recipient info, marketing/PHI sale, signatures), with 16 specific record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. Four delivery format options are offered: paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure). The form also includes a rare USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release option, a forward-looking feature for structured data export.

However, the single-page constraint makes the layout quite dense, and some terminology (USCDI, Direct Address, NPI) is jargon that would be opaque to most patients. The language is a mix of plain language and legalese—the six "I understand that..." statements are reasonably clear, but the overall form assumes familiarity with medical records processes.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked optional but unnecessary for records authorization and a data minimization concern.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form states patients may obtain copies "for a reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts, and this language appears in a rights statement that could normalize fee collection even for Right of Access requests.
- **Fax restriction**: "(FAX only to Physician Office / Medical facility)" limits fax delivery destinations and may restrict patient choice.
- **No notarization or witness required**—a positive.
- **No in-person requirement**: Mail, fax, and online portal options are all available.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual**: Full Spanish translation (form-2.pdf) available alongside the English version—meaningful for Las Vegas's significant Spanish-speaking population, though the surrounding web pages remain English-only and some form footer elements were left untranslated.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare and forward-looking inclusion of interoperability standards on an ROI form.
- **Multiple electronic delivery choices**: Four format options with honest risk disclosures.
- **Alternative digital pathways**: Swellbox portal and MyHealthONE patient portal provide additional request channels beyond the PDF.
- **52 fillable fields**: Fully digital-first form design.

## Overall Assessment

MountainView Hospital, through HCA Healthcare's standardized forms and Sunrise Health's website, provides a reasonably accessible records request experience. The form is easy to find, technically well-built, and offers meaningful delivery format choices. The main weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway—patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization form that doesn't distinguish Right of Access rights, fee limits, or timelines. The availability of the Swellbox online portal and MyHealthONE partially compensates for this gap by offering alternative digital pathways. The form earns credit for its fillable design, Spanish availability, and USCDI awareness, but loses points for its generic framing, fee ambiguity, and unnecessary SSN collection.

# UAB Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UAB Hospital (UAB Medicine), a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, provides one of the clearer patient record request experiences encountered in this study. The organization maintains a dedicated medical records request page that explicitly separates patient self-access from third-party release, offering distinct downloadable PDF forms for each pathway. Three forms were retrieved: a patient self-access form (form-1), a Callahan Eye Hospital variant (form-2), and a third-party authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

UAB Medicine stands out by offering a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-1, "Patient Request for Own Medical Records") that is clearly differentiated from its third-party authorization form (form-3). The patient access form opens with an explicit rights-affirming statement: *"UAB Medicine recognizes a patient's right to access their own protected health information."* The medical records request page at `uabmedicine.org/pay-your-bill/medical-records-request/` routes patients to the correct form based on their need — self-access versus third-party disclosure — with separate download links. This is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the UAB Medicine website clearly organizes its medical records page. The patient access form has a descriptive URL and filename (`Patient-Request-own-medical-records.pdf`), making it identifiable even in search results. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Quality: The Primary Patient Access Form (Form-1)

Form-1 is a 2-page fillable PDF with **51 interactive form fields**, clean text extraction, and a logical layout. The form is structured into clear sections: patient demographics, recipient designation, sensitive records opt-in, date range, record package selection, delivery method, and signature. The language is generally plain and direct, though the tiered package system requires some cognitive effort to parse.

A standout feature is the **five-tier record package system**, offering graduated levels of detail from key clinical notes through the entire medical record. This gives patients meaningful control over scope rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice. Additionally, nine individual record-type checkboxes allow specific requests (operative reports, billing records, medication list, radiology images, etc.).

**Delivery options** are comprehensive: paper mail, in-person pickup, fax, CD, and email. Electronic delivery includes a clear notice about encryption and privacy. For form submission, patients can return the completed form by mail or **fax (205-930-6721)**, providing an adequate electronic submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no notarization or witness requirements. No in-person submission is required. There are no excessive procedural hurdles — a patient signs once and does not need to initial multiple clauses (unlike form-2's three-initial requirement). However, **fees are not mentioned at all** — neither confirming free patient access nor disclosing a fee schedule. This silence creates ambiguity for patients who may reasonably want to know costs upfront. Similarly, **no turnaround time** is stated.

One ambiguity warrants mention: the form asks patients whether to include psychiatric/substance use records (opt-in checkbox on page 1) but then includes blanket authorization language covering those same records in the signature block on page 2, creating a potential contradiction.

## Contextual Notes on Other Forms

Form-2 (Callahan Eye Hospital variant) serves the same self-access function but is notably inferior: it has **zero fillable fields**, requires print-and-handwrite completion, and is 3 pages despite offering less content (2 record packages versus 5). Its title conflates "Patient Access" with "Authorization for Use or Disclosure," and it omits the rights-affirming opening statement present in form-1. It also contains a pagination error ("Page 3/2"). However, the high-watermark principle means UAB is assessed based on form-1, not this weaker variant.

Form-3 is correctly scoped as a third-party authorization and is appropriately separate from the patient access pathway. Its text layer is completely garbled due to CID font encoding issues, creating accessibility barriers, but this does not affect the patient self-access assessment.

## Overall Assessment

UAB Hospital delivers an above-average patient record request experience. The dedicated patient self-access form with rights-affirming language, fillable fields, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options — combined with a well-organized website that clearly separates patient access from third-party release — places this organization among the better performers. The primary gaps are the absence of fee disclosure and turnaround time information. The form is not cutting-edge (no online portal or digital submission), but the fillable PDF with fax submission represents a solid, accessible workflow.

# Community Health Center, Inc. — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Middletown, Connecticut. Three PDF forms were retrieved: a standard English ROI authorization (form-2, Rev. 6/2019), a Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 7/2019), and a site-specific variant pre-filled for the Birth to Three early intervention program (form-1). The standard English form (form-2) is the most relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway and Patient Self-Access

CHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All three PDFs are variants of a single generic "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information" — a dual-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for both releasing records to third parties and obtaining records from other providers. However, the form does include an explicit self-request section: "If to ME, my records should be released via: Mail / Fax / Pick-Up / E-Mail." This accommodates patient self-access but does not distinguish it as a separate regulatory pathway (§164.524 Right of Access vs. §164.508 third-party authorization).

The patient forms page on chc1.com has transitioned from direct PDF links to Luma Health online portals for ROI requests. Two Luma Health links are now offered ("CHC to release health information to another agency" and "CHC to obtain health information from another agency"), suggesting the organization is modernizing its workflow. The site also references a myCHC patient portal for online record access. The legacy PDFs remain hosted in the WordPress uploads directory but are no longer linked from the patient-facing navigation.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability was **moderate**. The patient forms page is navigable, but the PDF forms themselves are legacy documents — discoverable only via web search or URL pattern guessing. The current site directs patients to Luma Health portals. No bot blocking or download difficulties were encountered; all PDFs downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-2) is a well-organized **single-page** document with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of disclosure → self-request delivery options → record type checkboxes → date range → sensitive information opt-ins → reason → expiration → legal notices → signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and a side-by-side column design for the "Release TO" vs. "Obtain FROM" paths.

The form is **not fillable** — zero interactive PDF fields despite being a digitally authored document. All blanks are underscored lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. Submission is via fax (860-343-7379) or mail (575 Main Street, Middletown, CT 06457). A patient would need to print the form, fill it by hand, and fax or mail it in.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though the legal disclosure paragraph at the bottom is dense. The form provides approximately 20 fields for a self-request (patient demographics, delivery method, record types, date range, reason, signature block). Record type options are granular (9 categories plus "Other"), and patients can specify date ranges and selectively exclude sensitive information.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fax submission is available, so physical delivery is not the only option. No fees are mentioned. The form states a 30-day fulfillment window, consistent with HIPAA requirements.

Two minor compliance concerns: (1) the form asks for a reason for the request (Legal, Transferring Care, etc.), which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA; and (2) the default scope is the last 3 years unless a broader range is specified — this could inadvertently limit patients who don't realize they must explicitly request their full record.

A typo persists in the legal text ("in response to his authorization" instead of "this authorization") across both English forms.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version** available — important for an FQHC serving a diverse Connecticut population
- **Email delivery** offered as a self-request option, which is uncommon and reduces barriers
- **Granular exclusion controls** for drug/alcohol information (patients can specify what to exclude, not just all-or-nothing)
- **Transition to Luma Health portal** suggests active modernization of the records request process
- **Single-page design** keeps the form concise and manageable

## Overall Assessment

CHC provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient self-access. The generic authorization form accommodates self-requests via a dedicated delivery section, and the availability of a Spanish translation and email delivery are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of fillable fields, the conflation of patient access with third-party release, the legacy status of the PDF forms, and minor compliance gaps (reason field, default 3-year scope) prevent the organization from scoring higher. The transition to Luma Health portals is promising but could not be fully evaluated. **Grade: C** — adequate with notable room for improvement.

# Owensboro Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Owensboro Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Owensboro, Kentucky, operating three hospitals (Regional Hospital, Muhlenberg Community Hospital, and Twin Lakes Medical Center) plus a medical group. The organization provides a single, system-wide "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Health Information" form (form-1) accompanied by a dedicated plain-language instruction sheet (form-2). Both documents are easily accessible online.

## Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved, both directly downloadable PDFs:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary ROI authorization form (2 pages). This is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Patients check "Me" as recipient and "Patient Request" as purpose to request their own records.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A companion instruction document (2 pages) explaining each section of the form in plain language, with submission addresses, fax numbers, and an email address.

Submission options include mail, fax, and email (himroi@owensborohealth.org for the main hospital), providing adequate electronic submission pathways. MyChart is also referenced as both a format and delivery option, indicating a patient portal pathway exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Owensboro Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves all purposes — patient requests, legal/attorney, insurance, and third-party release. However, the form does clearly accommodate patient self-access: "Me" is a prominently positioned recipient checkbox, "Patient Request" is a reason option, and the instruction document is written from the patient's perspective ("If you are wanting to receive your records check the box labeled 'Me'"). The dual-purpose design means patients must navigate fields intended for third-party release (recipient address, legal representative sections) and understand which parts apply to them, but the instruction sheet mitigates this confusion substantially.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. A simple web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's medical records page also surfaces both documents. No login walls, bot blocking, or CAPTCHAs were encountered. This earns a top findability score.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form has a proper text layer but **zero fillable fields** — all data entry areas are underscored blank lines and non-interactive checkboxes. This is a print-and-fill document. A patient must print, handwrite, and then fax, mail, or email a scan. The layout is logically organized across 2 pages with clear section headers and a reasonable field count (~15-18 fields). Language is a mix of plain English and necessary legal terminology; the companion instruction document compensates by restating everything in plain language.

The form offers an unusually comprehensive set of format options (Paper, MyChart, EHI Export, Email, Fax, CD, USB) and delivery methods (Mail, Pickup, Fax, MyChart, encrypted email, unencrypted email with risk warning). The explicit inclusion of **EHI Export** with a detailed explanation — covering all ePHI across the organization and named Community Connect Partners, delivered in TSV format — is rare and exemplary.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Multiple submission channels (mail, fax, email) are available. No fees are mentioned on the form or instructions, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs but not actively deterred. The 120-day authorization expiration is appropriate for third-party releases but is technically unnecessary for patient self-access under HIPAA § 164.524, which grants an ongoing right. The "Your Rights" section covers voluntariness, right to revoke, right to inspect, and re-disclosure risk — a solid rights statement.

## Notable Strengths

- **EHI Export option**: Explicitly offered with named partner organizations and format details — well ahead of industry norms.
- **Companion instruction document**: A dedicated 2-page plain-language guide is an uncommon and patient-friendly practice.
- **Comprehensive delivery options**: Seven format choices and six delivery methods, including encrypted/unencrypted email with clear risk disclosure.
- **Help phone number**: The instruction document closes with a direct number for assistance.

## Weaknesses

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields despite having a digital text layer — a missed opportunity for a fully digital workflow.
- **No pathway differentiation**: Patient self-access is routed through the same authorization form as third-party releases.
- **No fee transparency**: Neither document mentions whether fees apply to patient access requests.
- **120-day expiration**: Applied broadly, including to patient self-access requests where it is legally unnecessary.

## Overall Assessment

Owensboro Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its comprehensive format/delivery options, EHI Export transparency, and companion instruction document. The main limitations are the non-fillable PDF format and the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization. For a community hospital system, this is a well-above-average effort that could reach excellence with fillable form fields and a patient-specific access process.

# CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital is a critical access hospital in Long Prairie, MN, part of the CentraCare regional health system based in St. Cloud. Long Prairie does not maintain its own facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it uses CentraCare's system-wide "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available from a centralized medical records release page at centracare.com. Three documents were found: the main ROI authorization form, a companion instruction sheet, and a separate substance use disorder consent form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

CentraCare does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for all releases of information — to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the "Release Information From" and "Release Information To" fields, placing themselves in the "To" field — an unintuitive workflow for someone who simply wants a copy of their own chart. There is no separate patient access request form, no dedicated section for individual access, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

That said, the form does include a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which normalizes patient self-requests and helps HIM staff route them appropriately. The companion instruction document (form-2) provides clear, section-by-section guidance written in second person, explaining not just *what* to fill in but *why* each field matters — an unusual and helpful touch.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. Web searches converged on CentraCare's centralized patient resources page, which logically organizes the forms. However, a patient searching specifically for "Long Prairie Hospital medical records form" must recognize that Long Prairie uses system-wide CentraCare forms and navigate accordingly. Direct download via automated tools (`curl`) was blocked by bot protection, requiring browser-based retrieval — a concern for assistive technologies and non-standard browsers.

## Form Document Quality

The main authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, despite its digital origins, it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand, or use third-party PDF annotation tools. This is a significant gap for a regional health system. The form has approximately 15–20 fields across patient demographics, release from/to addresses, record type checkboxes, delivery method, reason for release, and signature/date.

The layout is clean and logically structured: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Information to be Released → Special Disclosure → Preferred Method → Reason → Authorization → Revocation. Page 2 provides a comprehensive directory of all CentraCare HIM offices organized by region with fax numbers, phone, mail addresses, and a shared email. The language is mostly accessible, though the revocation paragraph contains dense legalese that may confuse patients.

## Submission and Delivery

CentraCare offers strong submission and delivery options. Completed forms can be submitted by **email** (CCHROI@CentraCare.com), **fax**, or **mail** — email submission is prominently featured and works for all locations. Records can be delivered via paper, CD, encrypted email, or MyChart portal. This is a genuinely patient-friendly set of options, particularly the encrypted email and MyChart delivery channels.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person submission requirement. No fee information is disclosed on either the form or the instructions, though the instructions reference "who may be responsible for the cost of records" without specifying amounts. No response time commitment is stated. The anti-re-release clause ("I do not authorize re-release of this information to anyone") is embedded as non-optional boilerplate rather than a patient choice. The form-3 SUD consent is an image-only scan with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers — but this is a supplementary document, not the primary pathway.

## Overall Assessment

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital provides a **functional but not patient-centered** records request process. The strong points are the multiple electronic submission channels (especially email), diverse delivery options (MyChart, encrypted email), the "Personal Use" reason checkbox, and the unusually helpful instruction document. The weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable form requiring print-and-handwrite, the absence of fee disclosure, and the lack of any patient rights information. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was designed for third-party release and the patient must adapt to it. Grade: **B**.

# Bayshore Medical Center — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Bayshore Medical Center, part of the Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) system, routes patients through the system-wide infrastructure for medical records requests. Six documents were retrieved during the search process, but only two are directly relevant for a Bayshore patient requesting their own records: the **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary English pathway) and the **CMR-003 authorization form** (form-6, a 2-page PDF covering all 11 HMH hospitals). A Spanish companion form (CMR-003S, form-3) mirrors the English PDF. Additional documents include an older Medical Group outpatient release form (form-1, dated 2018), two forms from sister facility Pascack Valley (forms 2 and 5), and a records amendment form (form-4).

The primary pathway for English-speaking patients is the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, linked from the HMH system-wide Medical Records page under "Request Records." Spanish-speaking patients are directed to the CMR-003S PDF download. Notably, the English PDF version of CMR-003 is **not linked** from the Medical Records page — it was found only through web search under an inconsistent URL path (medical-group/patient-forms rather than patients-visitors).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Bayshore does not offer a dedicated patient self-access PDF form. The CMR-003 PDF is a generic HIPAA authorization framed around third-party disclosure: "I authorize Hackensack Meridian Health to release information to: Organization/Recipient." A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name as the "recipient" and select "Personal use" from five purpose options — an awkward workaround. The online portal (Swellbox/Datavant) likely provides a more patient-centric experience as the primary pathway, but the PDF form does not distinguish between individual access and third-party release.

Interestingly, Pascack Valley Medical Center (an HMH sister facility) offers a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-5) with patient-first language and a "Myself" default recipient option. This demonstrates that the HMH system has the concept of a dedicated patient-access form but has not standardized it across all facilities.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the relevant forms required significant effort. The search involved web searches, site-specific navigation, URL pattern guessing, and cross-facility comparison. The Bayshore Medical Center sub-page links to the HMH Medical Records page (2–3 clicks), which prominently features the Swellbox portal but buries the PDF forms. The English CMR-003 was located via web search under the Medical Group directory — a misleading location for a hospital-level form. Retrieval difficulty: **hard**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary PDF form (CMR-003, form-6) is a born-digital 2-page document with a clean text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print and hand-write all entries. This is particularly notable given that HMH's own amendment form (form-4) has 54 fillable fields — proving the organization has the capability but did not apply it to the ROI form. The layout is logically structured with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient info → recipient → location → records → purpose → sensitive-record consent → signature → delivery format. Record type granularity is good (11 categories) and delivery format options are comprehensive (paper, encrypted USB/CD, fax, secured email).

Language is a mix of plain and legal. Core instructions are clear, but the minor consent section and legal disclosures use dense, nested phrasing. The form lacks explicit submission instructions — while the contact directory on page 2 lists HIM phone and fax numbers for each campus, the form never tells patients *how* to submit the completed authorization. The fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee… Please ask."

## Barriers and Bright Spots

No notarization, in-person submission, or witness requirements exist. Fax submission is available (Bayshore HIM fax: 732-888-7332), providing an adequate electronic pathway. The vague fee disclosure and absent submission instructions are minor barriers.

The standout bright spot is the **EHI Export option** — an explicit offer to provide records in a machine-readable format uploadable to another EHR. This is exceptionally rare on ROI forms and directly supports 21st Century Cures Act interoperability goals (despite the typo "Electric" instead of "Electronic" Health Record). The Spanish companion form, comprehensive contact directory, and granular sensitive-record consent are additional strengths.

## Overall Assessment

Bayshore Medical Center, via HMH, provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox/Datavant portal offers a digital-first primary pathway, and the PDF form — while non-fillable and oriented toward third-party release — includes progressive features like EHI Export and multilingual availability. The main weaknesses are the difficult findability of the English PDF, the generic authorization framing that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, and the lack of fillable fields on a form that could easily support them. Grade: **B**.

# SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison, a community hospital in Wisconsin's capital and part of the SSM Health system, provides three overlapping PDF authorization forms for medical records requests. None of the three forms are specifically designed for patient self-access; all are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" forms that a patient must adapt for their own use. The most relevant form for a patient at this facility is form-3, a location-specific version pre-filled with the Madison PO Box address and fax numbers for Dean Medical Group and SSM Health Hospitals.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found online:

1. **Form-1** (AH-FRM-11595, revised 8/2024): A Wisconsin-wide SSM Health authorization form covering all Wisconsin ministries. Two pages. Most recently updated but not facility-specific.
2. **Form-2** (DPM-2065-035, dated 1/2019): A system-wide SSMHC "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure" form. One page. The only form whose title explicitly includes "Request for Access to" and offers patient access as a named purpose with sub-options (Copy, Inspection, Summary). However, it is outdated (7+ years old), uses the former "SSMHC" branding, and lacks submission instructions entirely.
3. **Form-3** (A9008836, dated 5/2019): A Madison-area-specific authorization form listing St. Mary's Hospital – Madison and five neighboring SSM Health facilities. Two pages. Pre-filled with the Madison PO Box and fax numbers, making it the most actionable form for this facility.

The primary submission pathways are fax (608-294-6294 for Dean Medical Group, 608-270-6815 for SSM Health Hospitals) and postal mail (PO Box 259840, Madison, WI 53725-9840). Phone numbers are provided for inquiries. No online submission portal exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway at this facility. All three forms are structured as general HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. The best patient-access accommodation is found in form-3's "Personal Use" checkbox (Section 4) and the instruction "(If Release is to Self, State Self)" in Section 3. Form-2 goes further with explicit "For personal access" options and "Type of access requested" (Inspection / Hard Copy / Electronic Copy), but it is outdated and lacks facility-specific submission details. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, selecting the correct options to indicate self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was rated **easy**. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without bot blocking or JavaScript barriers. The SSM Health website has a "Get My Medical Records" page, and the location-specific form (form-3) has a well-structured URL path (`.../patients-and-visitors/get-medical-records/wisconsin/st-marys-madison-medical-records-request-form.pdf`). However, the existence of three overlapping forms — with different dates, scopes, and content — creates potential confusion. No guidance is provided about which form to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the most facility-relevant document, is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores and all checkboxes appear as "q" characters, indicating a print-oriented design. A patient must print the form, complete it by hand, and fax or mail it. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence (patient info → recipient → purpose → records scope → format → expiration → signature), and the back page provides thorough patient rights information in an organized bullet-point format. Language is formal but not excessively legalistic. Section 6 offers notably strong delivery format options: MyChart, DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, Fax, and Email — the inclusion of MyChart portal delivery is a genuine bright spot.

Estimated field count for a self-access request is approximately 15 fields (patient demographics, "self" as recipient, purpose selection, record type checkboxes, date range, format, expiration, and signature), which is reasonable.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees for "viewing"**: The back page states SSM Health "may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records." HIPAA does not permit charging patients for inspecting their own records, making the "viewing" language a compliance concern.
- **No 30-day timeline commitment** on form-3 (only form-2 mentions a 30-day response time).
- **Sensitive categories default to inclusion**: Section 5a defaults to disclosing mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and developmental disability records unless the patient explicitly excludes them — a design choice that could lead to unintended disclosure.
- **Outdated forms**: Form-3 dates to 2019, while form-1 was revised in 2024, raising questions about whether form-3 is still current.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart delivery option**: Offering patient portal delivery on the authorization form is uncommon and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **Multiple electronic delivery formats**: Email and fax are also available as delivery options.
- **Comprehensive patient rights information**: The back page covers right to refuse, inspect, copy, revoke, and includes detailed Wisconsin-specific minor consent rules.
- **Photocopy validity clause**: "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" removes a friction point.

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital – Madison earns a **C grade**. The organization makes forms easy to find and provides reasonable delivery format options including MyChart. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the complete absence of fillable form fields, the "viewing" fee language that may overreach HIPAA limits, and the use of a generic third-party authorization form for patient self-access all reflect a process that was not designed with the patient requester in mind. The form is usable but not patient-centered.

# Southeast Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Southeast Medical Group (SEMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Alpharetta, Georgia. SEMG does not publish its own standalone Release of Information form. Instead, it outsources the entire records-request process to **MediCopy**, a third-party health information management vendor. Four documents were retrieved during the evaluation: two versions of MediCopy's generic ROI authorization form (2023 and 2020), an SEMG patient portal proxy authorization form, and SEMG's multi-page patient registration packet. Only the MediCopy authorization forms are relevant to a patient requesting their own records.

## Pathways Available

The patient journey for requesting records begins at SEMG's website. The Resources section includes a "Medical Records" area with a "Request Records" link, which redirects through `semg.link/med-records` to **medicopy.net/patients** — a third-party site with no SEMG branding. From there, patients can either download a PDF authorization form or use MediCopy's HelloSign-based online authorization wizard. SEMG's FAQ also provides an email address (medicalrecords@southeastmedicalgroup.com) as a contact point for records requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SEMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The MediCopy authorization form is a generic instrument that treats every request identically — whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney is requesting them. "Personal Use" is listed among five purpose-of-disclosure options, but there is no separate pathway, form, or instructions for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The form asks patients to fill in both a source facility and a recipient, requiring a self-requesting patient to effectively provide their own contact information twice. No mention is made of patient-specific rights, fee limits, or the distinct legal framework that applies to individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. Direct searches for SEMG-specific ROI forms on the SEMG website and via Google yielded nothing — the forms page lists 10 patient forms but no ROI authorization. The FAQ answer for "How can I get a copy of my medical record?" is helpful, providing a direct link to MediCopy and an email address. However, a patient who bypasses the FAQ and navigates to the forms page would find no relevant document. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during retrieval. The redirect chain to a third-party site introduces an element of confusion — a patient clicking "Request Records" lands on a MediCopy page with no mention of SEMG.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (MediCopy 2023 authorization, form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. Despite being digitally authored, it has **zero fillable form fields** — patients must print and handwrite all information. The layout is well-organized, following a logical top-down flow: source facility → patient demographics → recipient → record types → purpose → delivery method → signature. Section headers use plain, conversational language ("Tell us about the patient," "How would you like the records sent?"), which is notably more approachable than typical ROI forms. The authorization paragraph is a single block of standard legal text covering validity, revocation, re-disclosure, and no-conditioning — dense but not unreasonably so.

The form offers good granularity for record-type selection (11 options including date ranges and "Other") and an opt-out exclusion model for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/STDs, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postal mail.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and creates unnecessary identity theft risk. **No submission instructions**: The form itself contains no address, fax number, email, or portal link for returning the completed authorization — a patient who downloads the PDF in isolation has no way to know where to send it. **Fee opacity**: The form notes "additional fee applies" for postal delivery but provides no dollar amounts for any delivery method. More concerning, SEMG's registration packet (form-4) discloses an Administrative Service Fee structure of $10–$150 per form, with "immunization records" listed as an example — this broad language could encompass patient access requests and would likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based fee limits.

## Notable Strengths

The plain-language section headers and sensitive-record exclusion options are genuine bright spots in form design. MediCopy's availability of an online HelloSign authorization provides a fully digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF. The FAQ's direct answer about records requests, including both a link and an email address, is more helpful than many practices' web presences. SEMG's registration form also includes modern patient-centered fields for preferred language and pronouns.

## Overall Assessment

SEMG provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records requests. The outsourcing to MediCopy means patients interact with a generic vendor form that was not designed around patient self-access. The form's content design is above average thanks to plain language and logical organization, but technical limitations (non-fillable PDF, missing submission instructions) and compliance gaps (SSN collection, fee ambiguity) weigh it down. The organization earns a middling assessment: records are obtainable, but the process was clearly not designed with the individual patient in mind.

# Proliance Surgeons — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Proliance Surgeons is a large, independent, for-profit physician practice group based in Seattle, WA, comprising multiple member practices (ProOrtho, Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, Northwest Physicians Specialists/MRI, Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons, and others). Four documents were retrieved: two nearly identical outgoing ROI authorization forms (form-2 from the main site, form-4 from ProOrtho), an image-only scan of a similar form (form-1 from NPS/MRI), and an incoming records transfer form (form-3 from Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons). The main medical records page also references Datavant as an online ROI partner, though the portal was not evaluated directly.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Proliance Surgeons does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. All outgoing ROI forms (form-1, form-2, form-4) use the same generic HIPAA authorization template ("Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information"), which is designed for third-party disclosure under § 164.508. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address as the "recipient" — an awkward workflow that conflates patient access rights (§ 164.524) with third-party authorization. The form does include an "at my request" reason checkbox, but the structure assumes disclosure to an external party. There is no mention of HIPAA Right of Access, no format/delivery preference field, and no reference to timelines or fee limitations specific to individual access.

The mention of Datavant on the medical records page suggests an online portal option exists, which would provide a more streamlined pathway, but the PDF forms themselves are the only downloadable option found.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A basic web search immediately surfaced multiple PDFs, and the main Proliance medical records page (proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links directly to the primary form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The main challenge is fragmentation: different member practices host their own versions of the same template, and a patient arriving at a subsidiary site (npsmri.com, proortho.com) may find a different version than the canonical one on the main site, with no cross-referencing between versions.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf** (ProOrtho), which is textually identical to form-2 but was noted to have interactive checkboxes (though metadata reports 0 AcroForm fields, suggesting non-standard implementation). Both are single-page, cleanly structured documents with two clear sections: "I. My Authorization" and "II. My Rights." The language is relatively plain, written in first person ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), and the layout is logical. Scope options are well-granulated (all records, condition-specific, date-specific, plus sensitive categories requiring explicit opt-in per Washington State law). However, neither form has true fillable text fields — patients must print and handwrite all entries. Form-2 includes a practice-specific fax number (425.820.8975) for submission; form-4 lacks any submission instructions entirely.

Form-1 is an image-only scan at 150 DPI with no text layer — completely inaccessible to screen readers and unsearchable. It represents the worst-case scenario a patient might encounter if they land on the NPS/MRI subsidiary site.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness requirement** — a positive.
- **No fees disclosed** — neutral; avoids deterrence but leaves patients uninformed.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax submission is available via form-2.
- **No electronic signature option** — requires printing and wet signature.
- **No response time stated** — patients have no expectation for turnaround.
- **Practice-specific contact info** baked into one form variant, creating confusion for patients at other Proliance locations.

## Notable Strengths

- **Concise one-page format** that covers all essential authorization elements without clutter.
- **Sensitive information categories** properly separated with individual opt-in checkboxes (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), compliant with Washington State RCW 70.02.
- **First-person rights language** in the "My Rights" section, which is more patient-friendly than typical third-person legal boilerplate.
- **Clear revocation instructions** with two specific methods (revocation form or letter).
- **Datavant portal mentioned** on the medical records page as an online alternative.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **Generic authorization form conflated with patient access** — no dedicated Right of Access pathway.
- **No fillable text fields** — print-and-handwrite workflow despite being a digitally-created document.
- **Fragmentation across subsidiaries** — multiple versions with inconsistent quality and no cross-referencing.
- **Form-1 is an image-only scan** — a digital accessibility failure.
- **Form-3 cites wrong state law** (California CMIA instead of Washington RCW 70.02) and wrong HIPAA year (2003 vs. 1996).

## Overall Assessment

Proliance Surgeons provides a readily findable, concise authorization form with reasonable content design and no major procedural barriers. However, the organization falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all record requests through a generic third-party authorization form with no differentiation for individual access. The print-and-handwrite workflow and subsidiary fragmentation further diminish the experience. The mention of Datavant as an online option is promising but not reflected in the downloadable forms themselves. Overall grade: **C** — adequate but not designed around patient self-access.

# East Georgia Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

East Georgia Healthcare Center (EGHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Swainsboro, Georgia. Three documents were found on its website: an English-language Medical Records Release form (form-1), a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The critical finding is that **none of these documents serve a patient requesting their own records from EGHC**. Both release forms are designed exclusively for incoming records — authorizing other providers to send records *to* EGHC — with EGHC's own address hardcoded as the destination.

## Access Pathway: The Wrong Form Problem

EGHC exemplifies the "wrong form" problem identified in this study. The Medical Records Release form's key language reads: *"I hereby request copies of all records pertaining to my health history and medical care released to: EAST GEORGIA HEALTHCARE CENTER, 215 NORTH COLEMAN STREET, SWAINSBORO, GA 30401."* The "Requesting medical records from" field is where the patient fills in their *previous* provider. A patient trying to exercise their HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) to obtain records *from* EGHC would find no applicable form anywhere on the website.

The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — it simply does not address patient self-access at all. The Notice of Privacy Practices mentions the right to "inspect and copy medical information" but provides no actionable instructions, no form reference, and no guidance on how to actually submit a request. A patient would likely need to call the Privacy Officer or visit in person, with no written process to guide them.

## Retrieval Experience

The forms page at https://eghc.org/forms/ is findable within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via site navigation. However, the forms are hosted on RightSignature, a third-party e-signature platform, which requires entering a name and email before viewing the form content. Old direct PDF links (from 2019) now return 404 errors but still appear in search engine results, creating confusing dead ends. The retrieval required moderate effort: the forms page was located without difficulty, but extracting the actual form content from RightSignature required technical workarounds (extracting the S3-hosted PNG image and converting to PDF).

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page document with clean layout and clear visual hierarchy: letterhead at top, patient identification fields, destination address, source provider field, a granular 17-option record type checklist, release duration options, legal disclaimer, and signature block. Via the RightSignature platform, the form is interactive with fillable fields and e-signature capability — a meaningful step toward digital-first form handling. However, the standalone captured PDF is image-only with no text layer, no fillable fields, and is completely inaccessible to screen readers.

The language is moderately accessible — the legal disclaimer covers standard HIPAA authorization elements (revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, non-conditioning) without being impenetrably dense. The form collects approximately 10 fields, which is reasonable in scope. However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, which creates unnecessary data exposure risk given that name, date of birth, and address are already collected.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No patient access form**: The most significant barrier — a patient has no written pathway to request their own records.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers on a form designed for fax/mail transmission is an unnecessary privacy risk.
- **Missing authorization expiration**: The form lacks an explicit expiration date, a required element under 45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(v).
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees for record copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form text gives no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **RightSignature viewing barrier**: Patients must provide name and email before even viewing the form content.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Both English and Spanish versions of the release form are offered — appropriate for an FQHC serving a diverse community in south-central Georgia.
- **RightSignature e-signature**: Electronic completion and submission capability is a genuine digital-first investment, even if applied to the wrong form.
- **Granular record type selection**: The 17-category checklist with an "Other" option gives patients meaningful control over what information is released.
- **Title X confidentiality**: The NPP includes thoughtful language about Title X Family Planning Program confidentiality.

## Overall Assessment

EGHC has invested in some positive infrastructure — bilingual forms, an e-signature platform, and a navigable forms page — but these investments are undermined by a fundamental gap: the organization provides no form or pathway for patients to request their own records. The only ROI-related forms are designed for incoming records from other providers. A patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access would find their rights acknowledged in the NPP but no actionable way to exercise them online. This represents a significant patient-centeredness failure that overshadows the form's otherwise reasonable document quality.

# Broward Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Broward Health, a government-owned regional health system in Fort Lauderdale, FL, offers a single general-purpose ROI authorization form ("Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Information") in four languages: English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese. The organization also provides an online records request wizard via Swellbox, a third-party vendor. The system operates multiple facilities (Medical Center, North, Coral Springs, Imperial Point, East Imaging Center, Weston), all sharing the same form and process.

## Access Pathway

Broward Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ROI form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both purposes, with a "MYSELF" checkbox alongside an "OTHER" option for third-party recipients. While this checkbox makes it possible for patients to request their own records, the form was not designed around the patient access use case — it requires a purpose statement (not required under HIPAA § 164.524 for patient access), applies minimum necessary language to all requests (which should not apply to individual access under 45 CFR § 164.502(b)(2)(v)), and includes a witness signature line that creates unnecessary procedural friction.

The Swellbox online wizard at `swellbox.com/broward-health-wizard.html` offers a potentially better digital pathway, though the PDF form appears to be the primary resource offered on the Medical Records Request page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The Medical Records Request page is reachable in approximately 3 clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Information Request → Medical Records Request) and is well-organized, listing all four language versions with direct download links plus the Swellbox option. However, **Cloudflare bot protection** blocked all direct `curl` download attempts, requiring browser-based retrieval. The English form URL was also case-sensitive, with the lowercase variant linked on the page failing — a subtle but real broken link.

## Form Document Quality

The form quality is a mixed picture. On the positive side, the form is a concise single page with a logical section flow: sensitive record classification, patient demographics, authorization and recipient designation, delivery method, purpose, date range, detailed record type checklist (~15 categories with date ranges for lab and radiology), patient rights disclosures, and signatures.

On the negative side, the **English version (form-1.pdf) is an image-only scan** — a grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no screen reader accessibility. This is the primary language version yet the worst quality artifact. The Spanish, Creole, and Portuguese versions are digitally created PDFs with text layers, but they too have **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The Spanish and Portuguese versions also have garbled text from font encoding errors in their expiration clauses. The form's footer references "ADDRESSOGRAPH" and carbon-copy routing ("WHITE - MEDICAL RECORD / CANARY - PATIENTS"), confirming its origin as a physical paper form from 2014 that has never been modernized.

Delivery options are limited to paper or **encrypted CD** — an anachronistic option in 2026 with no email, portal, or electronic transfer available through the form itself.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form includes a **witness signature line**, which is not required by HIPAA for patient access requests and could prevent patients from completing the form at home. A Broward Health authorized signature line is also present, suggesting the form may have been designed for in-person processing. No notarization is required. Fees are referenced vaguely ("reasonable charge" per CFR 164.524) without specific amounts. The website notes approximately 3 business days for processing. Fax submission is available at facility-specific numbers, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Exceptional multilingual support**: Offering the ROI form in four languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese) reflects genuine attention to South Florida's linguistic diversity and is rare among U.S. healthcare organizations.
- **Swellbox online portal**: Provides a fully digital alternative pathway for patients who cannot or prefer not to use the PDF.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 citation**: References the HIPAA Right of Access regulation directly in patient rights disclosures.
- **Granular record type selection**: The detailed checklist with date-range filtering gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.

## Overall Assessment

Broward Health demonstrates genuine effort in accessibility through multilingual forms and an online portal alternative, but the underlying form infrastructure is outdated and not patient-access-oriented. The 2014-era generic ROI authorization, image-only English scan, lack of fillable fields, witness requirement, and inappropriate application of minimum necessary language to patient requests all reflect an organization that has not modernized its records request process to match the spirit of HIPAA's individual access rights. The Swellbox portal partially redeems the experience, but the PDF pathway — which remains prominently offered — falls short of modern standards. **Grade: C.**

# A.O. Fox Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

A.O. Fox Hospital is a community hospital in Oneonta, NY, part of the Bassett Healthcare Network. It does not maintain its own medical records request form; instead, patients are directed to a single, network-wide "Authorization for Medical Record Release" (form H-6653) shared across all five Bassett facilities. This is the sole form available and serves as the primary pathway for any patient — whether requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Access Pathway

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of medical record release, not a dedicated patient access request form. However, it does meaningfully accommodate patient self-access: Section 2 includes a "Self, address listed above" checkbox, Section 7 offers "Patient Request" as a purpose option, and Section 4 defaults to electronic delivery via the MyBassett Portal when no format is specified. These features ensure a patient can navigate the form for self-access without excessive confusion, but the form's framing as an "Authorization for Medical Record Release" — rooted in 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization concepts rather than § 164.524 Right of Access — means patients are signing an authorization they don't technically need, and must navigate sections (verbal communication authorization, expiration dates, redisclosure warnings) that are largely irrelevant to self-access.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the pathway level. There is no separate patient access form, no distinct web page for individual record requests, and no portal-based request wizard. The single PDF form serves all purposes.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**, though not via A.O. Fox Hospital directly. A search for Fox-specific forms returned nothing; searching for the parent system — Bassett Healthcare Network — immediately surfaced a direct PDF link on bassett.org. A patient who knows Fox is part of Bassett would locate this quickly. One who searches only for "A.O. Fox Hospital medical records" might need an extra step. No bot blocking, broken links, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-constructed, digital-first fillable PDF** — one of the strongest technical implementations in the study. Key characteristics:

- **Fillable fields**: 83 AcroForm interactive fields across just 2 pages, covering every checkbox, text input, and signature area. This is unusually thorough.
- **Layout**: 10 clearly numbered sections with bold headings provide logical flow and easy scanning.
- **Delivery options**: Seven methods offered (MyBassett Portal, USB, CD, Fax, US Mail, in-person pickup at two locations, Email with encrypted/unencrypted options). The portal-first default is a progressive design choice.
- **Record type selection**: 13 categories plus "Entire Medical Record" and an open-ended "Other" field, with date range controls.
- **Sensitive records**: An opt-out model (Section 6) lets patients exclude categories they don't want disclosed, rather than requiring explicit opt-in for each — a patient-protective default.

**Weaknesses** are minor but notable: two typos ("Frist" for "First", "DISCLOUSRE" for "DISCLOSURE"), internal Windows file paths exposed in the revision line (`d:\forms\hosp\.ofm`), and dense legalese in the rights section — particularly the HIV/AIDS redisclosure paragraph, which is a single four-line sentence. The form does not mention fees or response times.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. The form requires only a patient signature — no notarization, no witness, no in-person submission requirement. The no-conditioning statement is clearly articulated. The one-year date range default ("If left blank, information from the past (1) year will be provided") could inadvertently limit scope for patients seeking older records, but this is a scope default rather than a true barrier.

## Bright Spots

- **Portal-first default delivery** is rare and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **83 fillable fields** on a 2-page form represents exceptional digital-first design.
- **Seven delivery format options** including encrypted email with explicit risk acknowledgment.
- **Opt-out model for sensitive records** defaults toward completeness.
- **No-conditioning language** explicitly protects patient rights.

## Overall Assessment

A.O. Fox Hospital, through its parent Bassett Healthcare Network, provides a technically excellent form that is easy to find and free of major barriers. The form's primary limitation is structural: it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual right of access — through a generic authorization framework designed for third-party release. While the form accommodates patient self-access well, it does not center it. A dedicated patient access pathway or a clearly separated section for self-access requests would elevate this from a good form to an exemplary one. Grade: **B**.

# Prevea Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Prevea Health is an independent nonprofit physician practice based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It offers a single authorization form — an "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (PRV_839, rev. 0118) — as its primary mechanism for patients to request their own medical records. The same form is available in four languages: English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. No separate patient access–specific form or online portal was identified.

## Access Pathway

Prevea Health uses a **generic HIPAA authorization form** rather than a dedicated patient access form. However, the form explicitly accommodates patient self-requests: Section 3 ("To Disclose To") includes a "Self" checkbox with delivery options (pick up, mail, on-site viewing, electronic format, and email with encrypted/unencrypted options). Section 7 ("Purpose") includes "Patient Request" as a named checkbox option. While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, the form clearly signals that patients can use it for their own records — placing it above average among generic authorization forms.

The form does not differentiate the legal basis for patient self-access (HIPAA § 164.524) from third-party release (§ 164.508), but the practical workflow is reasonably clear for a patient who wants their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and the form is directly linked from the Patient Forms and Documents > Medical Records page at prevea.com. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was encountered. The URL is descriptive. This is a model for how organizations should make forms accessible.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally-created PDF** — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. A patient must print and hand-fill the form (or annotate it in a PDF viewer). This is the form's most significant technical limitation. The layout is logically organized into nine numbered sections with clear headings, and the single-page format keeps things concise. However, the density required to fit everything onto one page makes the rights section (Section 8) extremely cramped and difficult to read.

Section 8 is the form's weakest content area: a ~200-word paragraph of dense legalese with complex nested clauses that would challenge most patients. The rest of the form uses reasonably plain language with clearly labeled fields and checkbox options.

The form provides granular record-type selection (12 categories plus a free-text field) and includes opt-out checkboxes for sensitive information (alcohol/drug abuse, HIV results, mental health) consistent with Wisconsin law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Barriers

- **No notarization required.** Witness signature is needed only for AODA/Mental Health disclosures, consistent with legal requirements.
- **Fees:** The form states "copy fees may apply" but does not disclose specific amounts — neutral but not fully transparent.
- **Date range default:** If left blank, only records from the past two years are disclosed. This restrictive default is a notable red flag — patients seeking complete records must affirmatively specify a date range, which is unintuitive.
- **Submission instructions absent:** The form provides no guidance on where or how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, mailing address, or email for the HIM department. A patient who downloads and completes the form has no clear next step.
- **Minor errors:** "42 CRF" (should be CFR) and "e-email" (doubled prefix) suggest limited quality review.
- **HSHS references:** The form references "HSHS" (Hospital Sisters Health System) without explanation, which may confuse patients who know only Prevea Health.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — rare among physician practices and reflective of local demographics.
- **Five delivery options** including electronic format and email with encrypted/unencrypted distinction — well above average.
- **Explicit self-request pathway** via the "Self" checkbox and "Patient Request" purpose option.

## Overall Assessment

Prevea Health provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience with genuine accessibility strengths (multilingual forms, electronic delivery options, easy findability). The primary weaknesses are the non-fillable PDF format, missing submission instructions, a restrictive date range default, and dense legalese in the rights section. The form serves patients adequately but falls short of best-in-class due to its paper-oriented workflow and the absence of submission guidance.

# CrescentCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CrescentCare is an independent nonprofit FQHC in New Orleans, Louisiana. The organization provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms — one in English (form-1.pdf) and one in Spanish (form-2.pdf) — for patients to request release of their medical information. Both are prominently linked from the Patient Resources and Downloads page. Notably, CrescentCare also maintains a dedicated "Request your medical records" page at `/records-request-form/` with an online submission option, providing a digital-first alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Assessment

CrescentCare uses a single generic HIPAA authorization form for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form is designed with patient self-access as a first-class use case: the "Myself via" option appears first in the recipient section, before the "Or to:" third-party option. This is a meaningful design choice that signals patient access is not an afterthought. The form offers three delivery methods for self-requests — Patient Portal, Encrypted Email, and Pick Up — with two of the three being electronic.

The organization goes further by offering a separate online records request page, giving patients who prefer a fully digital workflow an alternative to printing and mailing a PDF. This dual-pathway approach (PDF form plus online portal) is commendable for an FQHC.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding CrescentCare's forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's Patient Resources page prominently lists both language versions. No bot blocking, browser fallbacks, or creative search strategies were needed. The filenames are descriptive and language-tagged (`_en.pdf`, `_es.pdf`). Retrieval difficulty: Easy.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer. It follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient Information → Recipient → Information to Be Disclosed → Special Authorization for Sensitive Records → Purpose → Expiration → Patient Rights → Signature. The language is plain and accessible throughout; the patient rights section uses clear bullet points rather than dense legalese.

The form provides meaningful granularity with six record-type checkboxes plus an "Other" option, and appropriately gates sensitive records (behavioral health, substance use, HIV/AIDS) behind separate patient initials, consistent with Louisiana law and 42 CFR Part 2.

The primary weakness is that the PDF has zero fillable form fields despite being digitally authored. Patients must print, handwrite, and return the form — a notable gap for a document distributed online. Additionally, the form lacks submission instructions: no mailing address, fax number, or email address appears on the form itself, leaving patients uncertain how to return it.

## Barriers and Compliance

CrescentCare's form imposes no unnecessary barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement. The no-conditioning statement is explicit ("my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on my signing this authorization"). Revocation rights are clearly stated, though requiring a "signed letter" is a slightly higher bar than simply accepting any written request. No fees are mentioned on the form — this neither discourages patients nor sets expectations. No response timeframe is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Providing fully translated English and Spanish forms with identical structure is especially appropriate for New Orleans' diverse patient population.
- **Electronic delivery options**: Offering Patient Portal and Encrypted Email for self-requests is progressive — many organizations only offer mail or pickup.
- **Online records request page**: The dedicated `/records-request-form/` page provides a digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF workflow.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Fitting all necessary authorization elements on one well-organized page respects patient time.
- **Self-access prioritized**: Placing the "Myself via" option before third-party release on the form signals that patient access is a primary use case.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive form fields despite digital authoring — a missed opportunity for a form designed for online distribution.
- **No submission instructions**: The form gives patients no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **No fee or timeline disclosure**: Patients have no expectations about cost or turnaround time.

## Overall Assessment

CrescentCare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an FQHC. The combination of a well-designed bilingual authorization form, explicit patient self-access options, electronic delivery methods, and a separate online records request portal places it ahead of most peers. The main gaps — a non-fillable PDF and missing submission instructions — are common across the industry and prevent an excellent rating. Overall grade: B.

# Springhill Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms & Pathways

Springhill Medical Center provides two downloadable documents from its Medical Records page: a single-page "Request for Release of Health Information" authorization form (form-1.pdf) and a generic ONC patient rights infographic (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is an actionable authorization form. The organization's Medical Records page also links to a **Zoho-based online ROI request portal** operated by MedRecs Management, and mentions a patient portal. The HIM department accepts fax submissions at 251.410.4014.

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

Springhill does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole authorization form uses a generic structure — "I hereby authorize ___ to release the following information to ___" — designed for third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in the hospital as the source and themselves as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that individual access requests have different legal requirements than third-party authorizations. The Zoho portal may offer a more tailored digital workflow, but the downloadable form funnels all requesters through a single generic pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A simple web search returned the PDF directly, and the organization's Medical Records page clearly links to both the form and the Zoho portal. No bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. However, the form URL embeds "2011-Version-1" in the filename, raising immediate questions about currency.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** — no interactive fields, no clickable checkboxes, just underscore blanks and bracket-style checkboxes requiring print-and-handwrite completion. At one page, the length is reasonable, and the logical flow (demographics → authorization → record types → delivery method → legal language → signature) is sound. However, the form is visually dated and dense, cramming all content onto a single page with small text. The language is a mix of functional and legal — mostly accessible but with a dense legal block at the bottom covering revocability, sensitive information categories, and redisclosure warnings.

The form requests approximately 20–25 fields including patient demographics, record type selections, delivery method details, and signatures. Notably, it asks for the patient's **Social Security Number**, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates a significant privacy risk.

## Barriers & Concerns

Several barriers stand out:

- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers for a medical records request creates unnecessary privacy risk, especially for forms submitted via fax or email.
- **Witness signature line**: The form includes a "Signature of Witness" field, implying a witness may be required — an unnecessary barrier with no HIPAA basis for patient-initiated requests.
- **Sensitive information bundling**: Substance abuse, psychiatric, STD, and HIV/AIDS records are bundled into the general authorization without separate opt-in, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2.
- **Outdated references**: The form still uses the legacy name "Springhill Memorial Hospital" and references "UB-92" (replaced by UB-04 in 2007), signaling a form that has not been updated in over a decade.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods**: The 2011-era form offers five delivery options — pick-up, mail, fax, patient portal, and email — which was forward-looking for its time.
- **Online portal availability**: The Zoho-based electronic request portal provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.
- **Patient rights education**: Hosting the ONC patient rights infographic shows awareness of patient access rights, even if the resource is generic.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: The form explicitly states that treatment and payment cannot be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Springhill Medical Center provides a functional but dated pathway for records access. The form is easy to find and offers multiple submission methods including fax and email, but the authorization form itself is a 15-year-old, non-fillable generic release form that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party disclosure. The SSN requirement and witness signature line create unnecessary barriers. The existence of a Zoho-based online portal is a meaningful positive, offering patients a digital alternative — though the downloadable form itself reflects a process that has not been meaningfully updated since 2011. A patient can get their records through this organization, but the experience requires navigating a form not designed for them.

# ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

ENT & Allergy Associates is a large for-profit physician practice with 80+ offices across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Despite its size, the organization provides one of the poorest records-request experiences in this study. The sole ROI form is a 17-year-old Microsoft Word document buried on the website with no visible link, no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no pathway designed for patients requesting their own records.

## Forms & Pathways

Two documents were retrieved:

1. **form-1.pdf** (the ROI form): "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA" — a 2-page generic third-party release authorization. Originally a `.doc` file created in 2009, converted to PDF for this study. This is the only records-release mechanism available.
2. **form-2.pdf** (not an ROI form): "Patient Acknowledgment Form – Allergy Form Completion Fee" — a $25 fee acknowledgment for physician form completion (school/activity clearance). Found in the footer under the misleading label "Allergy Authorization Form."

There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The only pathway is downloading a Word document and figuring out independently how to submit it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for releasing records to a named third party. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in Item 8 ("Name and address of person(s) or category of person to whom this information will be sent"), which is unintuitive and not explained anywhere. The form contains no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights statement specific to individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient may simply want to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was exceptionally difficult. The website has no "Patient Forms," "Medical Records," or "Request Your Records" section. The FAQ mentions medical records only in the context of retention policies. The footer link labeled "Allergy Authorization Form" leads to the fee acknowledgment (form-2), not the ROI form. The actual ROI form exists at an orphaned URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) not linked from any navigable page — it was only discoverable through a targeted `filetype:doc` web search. A patient browsing the website would have no path to this form.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a Word `.doc` file with zero fillable fields, requiring patients to either print and handwrite or type into the Word template. The layout uses a numbered list but lacks visual hierarchy — no section headers, minimal bold, and no section dividers. Language is moderately dense legalese with constructions like "except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization." Item 6 is entirely in ALL-CAPS and contains a typo ("THEN" instead of "THE"). The form collects approximately 12–15 pieces of information, including the patient's Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection point that creates a privacy risk.

## Barriers & Red Flags

- **No submission instructions whatsoever.** The form provides no address, fax number, email, or portal link. A patient who manages to find and complete it has no guidance on how to return it.
- **SSN requested.** Unnecessary for identity verification in records requests and a data security risk.
- **Severely outdated.** Last modified January 2009 — predates the HITECH Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the ONC Information Blocking Rule.
- **Confusing Item 6.** The ALL-CAPS restriction on discussing health information could be read to limit the provider's ability to discuss records even with the patient themselves.

## Bright Spots

- **Proper handling of sensitive categories.** The form correctly requires separate initialing for HIV, substance abuse, and mental health records, with anti-redisclosure language and civil rights contact information per NY/NJ state law.
- **Anti-conditioning statement.** Item 4 clearly states treatment and benefits will not be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

ENT & Allergy Associates presents a deeply patient-unfriendly records request experience. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, an outdated Word document format, zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no patient-access-specific pathway means that a patient attempting to request their records online would face barriers at every step. For a practice of this size and market presence, this represents a significant gap in patient-centered service. **Grade: D.**

# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Medical Center (CMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Toms River, NJ, part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also offers a Ciox/Swellbox online records request portal as the primary pathway for patients.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF documents were downloaded:

- **form-1.pdf** — A CMC-specific one-page "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility" (2017, image-only scan, no fillable fields). This is the legacy facility-level outbound release form.
- **form-2.pdf** — A one-page "Request for Release of Health Information *to* CMC" (2015/2021, image-only scan). This is an inbound records transfer form and is **not relevant** for a patient requesting their own records.
- **form-3.pdf** — The system-wide RWJBH "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (3 pages, Nov 2025, has text layer but no fillable fields). This is the most current and comprehensive form, covering all RWJBH locations. It is the best available PDF for patient self-access.

Beyond PDF forms, the medical records page prominently features a **Ciox/Swellbox online portal** for electronic records requests. Fax (732-557-2209) and email (cmcroimedicalrecords@rwjbh.org) submission options are also available.

## Patient Access Pathway

CMC does not offer a dedicated form specifically designed for patient self-access. Both the legacy CMC form (form-1) and the system-wide form (form-3) are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient access, third-party requests, insurance, legal, and continuing care. On form-3, "Personal" appears as a purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care/Treatment," "Insurance," and "Legal," but the patient must name themselves as the recipient in a field clearly designed for third-party organizations. The Swellbox online portal, however, may provide a more patient-centric experience as a purpose-built records request tool, and the organization directs patients toward it as the primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was straightforward. A direct web search for CMC medical records authorization returned the facility's medical records page immediately. The page links to the CMC-specific forms and references the online portal. The system-wide form (form-3) required a separate search at the RWJBH system level. No bot blocking or authentication barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing form-3 (the best available PDF): the document has a text layer and clean digital rendering (created in Word, not scanned), but **lacks fillable fields** — a patient must print it and complete it by hand. The layout is well-organized with a logical flow: patient demographics → facility selection → recipient → delivery method → record types → purpose → legal terms → signature. Record type selection is granular (15+ checkboxes including behavioral health, pathology, and imaging). Page 3 provides a helpful contact directory for all RWJBH facility HIM departments. Legal text on page 2 is dense but not impenetrably so. The facility checkbox grid on page 1 is visually crowded but functional. The older CMC-specific forms (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans with zero accessibility — no text layer, no fillable fields, no screen reader support.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-3 includes anti-conditioning language ("my refusal will not affect the start, continuation or quality of my medical treatment") and clear revocation rights. No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is **vague**: records are free when sent to another provider for care, but "there may be a fee" for other requests with no schedule or amounts provided. HIPAA cost-based fee limits for patient access are not mentioned. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The 180-day authorization expiration is reasonable.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods** on form-3: paper pickup, US Mail, encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format" — far better than most ROI forms.
- **Online portal** (Swellbox) provides a fully digital pathway alongside PDF forms.
- **Comprehensive contact directory** (page 3) with phone and fax for every RWJBH HIM department.
- **Multiple submission channels**: fax, email, online portal, and mail.

## Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any PDF form despite digital creation.
- **Generic authorization form** — no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow.
- **Opaque fee disclosure** — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.
- **Legacy CMC forms** (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans that remain linked on the website alongside the modern system-wide form, creating potential confusion.

## Overall Assessment

Community Medical Center earns a **B** overall. The organization benefits significantly from the Swellbox online portal and strong delivery method options on the system-wide form. The retrieval experience is easy and multiple submission channels exist. However, the PDF forms are non-fillable and generic, the fee disclosure is vague, and there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow. The coexistence of legacy image-only scans alongside a modern system-wide form reflects incomplete digital modernization.

# Synthesis: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital

## Overview

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital in Murfreesboro, TN is part of Ascension, the largest nonprofit Catholic health system in the U.S. For medical records requests, the hospital relies on two pathways: a **Swellbox-based online request wizard** (the primary pathway linked from the patient portal page) and a **downloadable PDF authorization form** (STHS490) shared across the entire Ascension Saint Thomas system in Tennessee. Only the PDF form was available for detailed evaluation. No dedicated patient access request form was found — the single PDF serves both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information at the form level. The PDF form (STHS490) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Disclosure of PHI" that handles both use cases through a single "and/or" construction: patients can check "Use my health information" and/or "Disclose my health information to the following individual or organization." A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same form — including specifying themselves as the recipient — as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), the 30-day response obligation, or patient-specific fee limits.

However, the existence of the **Swellbox online wizard** as the primary pathway is significant. Though we could not evaluate the wizard's internal design, the fact that patients are directed to an online request tool — rather than solely to a downloadable PDF — suggests a more modern and potentially more patient-friendly experience as the default path. This partially mitigates the generic nature of the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form was **easy**. A targeted Google search on the second attempt returned a direct link. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or browser fallback was needed. The form is hosted on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure (the URL path includes "legacy"), suggesting it predates the current website architecture and is discoverable primarily via search engines rather than site navigation. The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, is linked from the patient portal page via normal site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF form (STHS490) is a **single page** — concise and complete. It uses a numbered structure (items 1–7) with a logical flow from patient identification through record type selection, rights notice, and signature. The record type checklist (ten options plus "Other") gives patients meaningful control over scope. Contact phone numbers for all eight Saint Thomas facilities are listed, which is helpful.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. The layout is dense, with small fonts (likely 8–9pt in places) cramming all content onto one page. Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese, particularly in the revocation clause (item 5). There are no separate instructions, no multilingual versions, and no plain-language summary of patient rights.

The form offers **mail and email delivery** checkboxes (item 7), which is better than forms limited to mail or in-person pickup. Combined with the Swellbox wizard for online submission, a patient has viable electronic pathways available.

## Barriers

The most notable barrier is the **SSN field combined with "ALL BLANKS MUST BE COMPLETED"** — implying SSN is mandatory. HIPAA does not require SSN for a records authorization, and requiring it creates both a privacy risk and a potential deterrent. The form also uses stale branding ("Saint Thomas Health" in body text vs. "Ascension Saint Thomas" in footer) and has a filename/form number mismatch (sths409 vs. STHS490), which are minor but erode trust in document currency.

No notarization or witness is required. No fees are mentioned on the form. The six-month default expiration is reasonable.

## Strengths

- **Online alternative (Swellbox wizard)** as the primary pathway
- **Email delivery option** on the PDF form
- **Granular record type checklist** with helpful descriptions
- **HIM contact numbers** for all facilities listed directly on the form
- **Easy findability** — no search difficulties

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox online wizard as the primary pathway is a meaningful strength that elevates the organization above those relying solely on PDF forms. However, the PDF form itself — the only document available for detailed evaluation — is a generic third-party authorization form with no fillable fields, an implied SSN requirement, and no acknowledgment of patient self-access as a distinct right. The organization earns credit for offering electronic pathways but falls short on patient-centeredness and form document quality.

# Heartland Community Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Heartland Community Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Lawrence, Kansas, serving patients across three locations. The organization provides a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" — for all records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party release.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page PDF titled "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" (form-1.pdf), hosted in the organization's WordPress uploads directory. This form serves all release purposes — patient access, provider-to-provider transfers, insurance disputes, and referrals. A "Patient's Request" checkbox appears among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Records From" and "Records To" fields) is oriented around third-party transfer rather than individual access. A patient requesting records for personal use would find it unclear how to complete the "Records To" section.

Submission options are reasonable: email (medrecords@heartlandhealth.org), fax (785-856-0375), and mail. A phone line for questions (785-842-4477, Option 5) is also provided. These multiple channels meet the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was not discoverable through generic web searches but was found via a site-scoped search (`site:heartlandhealth.org`). The URL is descriptive and the download was straightforward once located. The form is not prominently linked from obvious patient-facing pages — it lives in a WordPress uploads directory, suggesting it may be embedded on an interior page but is not surfaced in primary navigation or a patient resources section.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally-created, single-page PDF with a full text layer — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it functions as a print-and-handwrite document. The layout is logically ordered (demographics → record types → delivery method → from/to → purpose → legal disclosures → signature → return instructions) and fits everything onto a single page, though the density is high with 16 fonts and tight spacing.

The form uses approximately 20+ data entry points (name, DOB, address, phones, date ranges, multiple checkbox groups, records from/to blocks, signature lines). The opening line — "To treat you effectively, your provider needs to review your past medical records" — is patient-friendly, though it subtly frames the form around incoming records transfer rather than patient-initiated access.

One notable design feature is the pre-bundled "Record Set" option, which offers a thoughtfully curated default bundle (last 3 visit notes, recent labs, medication list, immunization records, screening reports, and specialist list). This reduces decision burden for patients who want comprehensive records.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Witness requirement**: A "Witness" signature line is present but never explicitly stated as required. Its inclusion may deter patients or create confusion about whether a witness is actually needed.

**Mental health records**: These require a completely separate form and cannot be combined with other record types on the same submission, creating an additional barrier for patients seeking comprehensive records.

**Email liability disclaimers**: Two separate liability waivers for email delivery appear on the form, which may discourage patients from choosing this convenient option.

**Fees**: No fees are mentioned anywhere on the form — neither disclosed nor waived.

**Compliance language**: The form properly addresses revocation rights, 12-month expiration, treatment non-conditioning, and re-disclosure warnings. However, it does not reference the patient's Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Overall Assessment

Heartland Community Health Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The form is accessible online (with some searching), offers multiple submission channels, and includes some patient-friendly elements like the pre-bundled record set and plain-language opening. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party release framing, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of any dedicated patient access pathway all work against patient-centeredness. The form is adequate for its purpose but was not designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. For an FQHC serving a population that may face literacy or technology barriers, the non-fillable format and dense layout represent meaningful obstacles.

# Northwest Colorado Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Northwest Colorado Health is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms on its website: one for behavioral health records (form-1) and one for medical/dental records (form-2). Both are single-page PDFs available from a dedicated patient forms page. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient-access form — both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any release of information, whether to the patient themselves or to a third party.

## Access Pathway

Northwest Colorado Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Request Information FROM" / "Release Information TO" structure, treating a patient requesting their own records identically to someone authorizing release to an insurer, attorney, or another provider. The "Release Information TO" section does list "Self / Legal Guardian" as a pre-printed option, which at least acknowledges that patients may be the intended recipient, but the form's structure, legal language, and scope options are all oriented toward the general authorization use case.

Patients who received both medical and behavioral health services at this facility would need to complete **two separate forms** — a meaningful friction point not faced by those seeking release to a single third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped web search located the patient forms page at a logical URL path (`/what_you_can_do/patient-resources/patient-forms/english.html`). Both forms were publicly linked, downloadable without authentication, and no bot-blocking or CAPTCHA was encountered. The download URLs are GUID-based and not human-readable, but this is a minor cosmetic issue.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form for patient self-access is form-2 (Medical and/or Dental), as it covers the broadest category of records most patients would seek. Key observations:

- **Fillability:** Despite metadata reporting 43 field annotations, the form is functionally a flat PDF — not practically fillable. Patients must print and complete by hand.
- **Length:** A single page, which is commendably concise. However, this compresses a substantial amount of content into a tight layout.
- **Language:** The introductory paragraph is notably patient-friendly: "We value your privacy at Northwest Colorado Health. Legally, we cannot release your written health record to anyone (including you) without your specific consent." The tone shifts to denser legal language in the six numbered disclaimers but remains reasonably readable.
- **Layout:** Logically organized with clear sections — patient info, FROM/TO entities, record types, purpose, sensitive-information authorization, signature, and legal paragraphs. Checkbox-driven options for record types and disclosure purposes reduce writing burden.
- **Instructions:** The form provides adequate contextual guidance but lacks explicit step-by-step instructions. Critically, it provides **no submission instructions** — a patient who downloads and completes the form has no guidance on where or how to send it (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link for submission).

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection:** Both forms request the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for identity verification under HIPAA and creates a data security risk.
- **No submission method stated:** The absence of submission instructions is a significant barrier. The Privacy Officer's mailing address appears only in the revocation clause, not as a submission destination.
- **No fee disclosure:** The forms neither mention fees nor state that patient access is free, leaving cost ambiguity.
- **Legacy organization name:** The revocation section refers to "Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association," the organization's former name, which could confuse patients despite the form's 04/2020 revision date.

## Bright Spots

- **Fast processing commitment:** "Up to 48 business hours" (~6 business days) is well within HIPAA's 30-day window and more specific and faster than most organizations promise.
- **Plain-language introduction:** The opening paragraph is warm, clear, and patient-friendly — significantly better than the legalistic openings common on ROI forms.
- **Photocopy validity:** The form states that photocopies are as valid as originals, reducing barriers for patients.
- **Non-retaliation statement:** Clearly states that care and payment will not be affected by declining to sign.
- **Easy findability:** Forms are publicly accessible without login or barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Northwest Colorado Health provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find, concise, and written with an unusually patient-friendly tone. However, the organization funnels all requests through a generic authorization form with no differentiation for patient self-access, collects unnecessary SSNs, provides no submission instructions, and offers only a print-and-handwrite workflow. The split into two separate forms by record category adds friction for patients. This is a typical small independent FQHC approach — adequate but not designed with the patient's individual access rights as a first-class concern.

# Natividad Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Natividad Medical Center, a government-owned community hospital in Salinas, CA, hosts two ROI authorization forms on its medical records page at `https://www.natividad.com/medical-records/`:

- **Form 1** (2019): A 1-page "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — an image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields. Despite being the newer version, it is a grayscale scan at 200 DPI that cannot be read by screen readers or completed digitally.
- **Form 2** (2007): A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" created from Microsoft Word. It has a text layer but is copy-protected (RC4 encryption) and also lacks fillable fields. It requests Social Security Number and contains a garbled legal citation.

Both forms serve the same general purpose — authorizing release of health information — and both remain linked from the website with no guidance on which is current or preferred.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. However, Form 1 does include explicit patient access language: "If you are the patient requesting your own records, you may choose between printed copies or CD." It also includes a "Patient" checkbox among requester roles. Form 2 has a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose but is structurally oriented toward third-party release, requiring the patient to name a "release to" recipient — awkward when requesting one's own records.

The organization does not differentiate individual access from third-party authorization through separate forms, sections, or pathways. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. A general web search for medical records release forms surfaced both PDFs, and a site-specific search confirmed the medical records page. The presence of two overlapping forms with unclear currency creates confusion — a patient finding both would not know which to use. The filename "Auth_ROI_e.pdf" for Form 2 is cryptic and unhelpful. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form is fillable — both require printing and completion by hand. Form 1's image-only format makes it completely inaccessible to assistive technology, likely violating Section 508 and WCAG standards for a government facility. Form 2's text layer is an improvement but copy-protection prevents text selection. Both forms use underscore-line blanks for data entry.

Form 1 packs substantial content onto a single page with cramped layout. Section headings exist but are not strongly differentiated from body text in the scanned format. Form 2 is better organized with clear section headers (USE AND DISCLOSURE, PURPOSE, EXPIRATION, MY RIGHTS, SIGNATURE) and logical flow across two pages, though footnotes descend into dense legal prose.

Language is generally plain in both forms, though both include legal phrasing that may challenge patients with limited health literacy. Neither form provides clear instructions for completion.

## Barriers

- **No electronic submission pathway documented**: Neither form specifies how to submit — no fax number, email address, or portal is mentioned. The forms only address what information to release, not how to submit the request.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate charges.
- **Outdated delivery options**: Form 1 states "Natividad policy is to provide all electronic records on a CD" — CDs are increasingly obsolete, and this may functionally limit patients' right to receive records electronically.
- **SSN collection** (Form 2): Requesting Social Security Number is unnecessary for HIPAA requests and creates identity-theft risk.
- **Blank revocation address** (Form 2): The form instructs patients to submit revocations "to the following address" but leaves the address blank.

## Bright Spots

- Form 1 explicitly addresses patients requesting their own records and offers format choices.
- Form 1's opt-out exclusion model (defaulting to full disclosure with options to exclude HIV, substance abuse, mental health records) is patient-friendly.
- Form 1 dropped the SSN requirement present in Form 2, showing incremental improvement.
- Both forms include patient rights language covering refusal, no-retaliation, revocation, and right to a copy.

## Overall Assessment

Natividad Medical Center provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly maintained patient access experience. The organization relies on generic third-party authorization forms rather than a dedicated patient access pathway. The newer form (2019) is paradoxically less accessible than the older one (2007) due to its image-only scan format — a regression in digital accessibility. Neither form is fillable, no electronic submission method is documented, and the dual-form situation with no guidance creates unnecessary confusion. For a government-owned facility, the accessibility failures are particularly concerning. The org earns a **C grade**, reflecting a process that technically exists but was not designed with patient self-access in mind.

# Copley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Copley Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Morrisville, Vermont. The hospital offers a single Release of Information form — titled "Patient Request for Health Information Authorization Form" (Form 1085, dated 07-21) — that serves as the primary pathway for patients seeking their own health records. No patient portal–based request option or online submission wizard was identified; the form is a downloadable PDF linked from the hospital's Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Copley's form is a **dual-purpose authorization** that handles both patient self-access and third-party release on a single page. The form includes a clear checkbox for "Provide a copy of my records to: Me," which meaningfully distinguishes the patient self-access use case — but it does not separate this pathway from third-party release. A patient requesting their own records encounters fields irrelevant to their situation, such as "Release my Records TO:" (with recipient name, address, fax, and phone fields) and "Purpose of Release." Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not state a purpose for requesting their own records, so the presence of this field — without clarification that it's optional for self-requests — could confuse or deter patients.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the phrase "Right of Access." While the authorization language (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure warning) is well-written, the form frames the interaction as an *authorization* rather than an *access right*, which is a conceptual distinction that matters for patient-centeredness.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Copley Hospital's release of information form immediately surfaced a direct link to the PDF. The form is also prominently linked from the Medical Records page under "For Patients + Visitors" in the main site navigation. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was required. The hospital's Medical Records page also links to three related HIPAA forms (amendment request, alternate communication, PHI restrictions), which shows a thoughtful information architecture even if the ROI form itself is the only one relevant to record requests.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page PDF** — impressively compact — with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → delivery/format options → authorization scope → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. The language is largely plain and accessible, with standout phrasing like "My treatment will not be impacted, no matter if I sign this Authorization or not."

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). This means patients must print and hand-fill the form, then fax or mail it back. The delivery and format options are notably strong — in-person pickup, mail, fax, and patient portal for delivery, plus paper copy or electronic copy (email, USB, CD, portal) for format — and the form helpfully notes that "Many documents that you may be requesting are available to you in your patient portal." But the submission process itself requires either fax (802-888-8361) or mail to the HIM department.

## Barriers & Compliance

**No notarization or witness** is required. Representative signers must attach proof of authority, which is a reasonable requirement. The authorization is valid for one year with clear revocation instructions including both mailing and fax addresses.

**Fees are not mentioned** anywhere on the form, leaving patients unable to anticipate costs. This is a notable gap — HIPAA requires transparency about fees for patient access requests.

The form is dated July 2021 and predates the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective April 2023), suggesting it may not reflect current requirements around electronic health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- **Comprehensive delivery and format options** — email, USB, CD, patient portal, fax, mail, and in-person pickup
- **Single-page efficiency** — all necessary content on one page
- **Clear voluntariness statement** in plain language
- **Easy findability** — prominent placement and search-engine accessible

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** — forces a paper workflow despite digital authorship
- **No fee disclosure** — patients cannot anticipate costs
- **"Purpose of Release" field** not flagged as optional for self-requests
- **No explicit Right of Access framing** — treated as authorization rather than access right
- **Form staleness** — over 4 years old, predating information blocking rules

## Overall Assessment

Copley Hospital provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience anchored by easy findability, a compact single-page form, plain language, and strong delivery/format options. The dual-purpose design accommodates patient self-access but doesn't optimize for it. The primary weaknesses — lack of fillable fields and absence of fee disclosure — represent missed opportunities rather than active barriers. Fax submission is available, providing an adequate electronic pathway. For a small critical access hospital, this is a competent if imperfect effort that would benefit from modernization: adding fillable fields, separating or clearly labeling the self-access pathway, and disclosing fee information.

# Columbus Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbus Community Hospital is an independent nonprofit community hospital in Columbus, Nebraska. A single ROI form was found: a one-page "Authorization to Release Medical Records" (form MR-1, dated December 2014). The hospital does not offer a patient portal-based records request, an online request wizard, or any dedicated patient self-access form. The sole pathway is this generic third-party authorization form, with email submission available via `release@columbusch.com`.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

The most significant finding is that Columbus Community Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form is structured entirely as a release authorization: "I authorize Columbus Community Hospital to release the following information on [patient] to: [Name and Address]." A patient requesting their own records must write their own name and address in the "to:" field — an unintuitive workaround with no guidance that this is a valid or expected use of the form. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that patients have a right to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The hospital operates two domains: `columbusch.com` (the primary patient-facing site) and `columbushosp.org` (a legacy domain hosting the PDF). The patient forms page on the newer site mentions the Release of Information form and provides an email address for submission, but does not include a direct download link. A web search was needed to surface the PDF URL on the legacy domain. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during download.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks are represented as printed underscores requiring handwritten completion. Despite having a text layer (not a scan), the document offers no digital interaction — patients must print, handwrite, and then scan or photograph it to submit via email.

At one page, the form is concise. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, recipient identification, treatment dates, record type checkboxes (nine options plus "Complete Record"), purpose checkboxes (six options), sensitive-information authorization, patient acknowledgments, and signature blocks. However, the single-page density leaves little whitespace, and internal filing codes appear in the footer ("Found in Policy Manager/Consent Forms," "c: HIPAA Manual," page "42") — artifacts of internal document management that were never removed for patient-facing use.

Language is generally understandable but includes unexplained jargon ("H & P") and legalistic constructions in the acknowledgment section. The form includes no instructions or guidance text explaining how to complete it.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form avoids several common barriers: no fees are mentioned, no notarization is required, and no in-person submission is mandated. The revocation rights are clearly stated, and a built-in "Notice of Revocation" section allows patients to revoke authorization without finding a separate form — a genuine bright spot. The non-retaliation statement and 12-month authorization expiration are appropriate.

However, the witness signature line is ambiguous — it is unclear whether a witness is required or optional, which could deter patients completing the form at home. The form's age (dated 2014, over 11 years old at evaluation) raises questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Built-in revocation section; granular record-type selection (nine categories); email submission channel available; concise single-page format.

**Red flags:** No patient self-access pathway; form structured exclusively for third-party release; no mention of patient rights; non-fillable PDF requiring print and handwrite; internal filing codes visible on patient-facing document; disconnected web presence with form hosted on legacy domain without links from the main site.

## Overall Assessment

Columbus Community Hospital provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly patient-centered records request process. The form works — a determined patient can download it, fill it out by hand, and email it in — but the experience reflects a pre-digital, compliance-oriented approach rather than a patient-access-oriented one. The absence of any dedicated patient self-access pathway, combined with a non-fillable form from 2014 and a fragmented web presence, places this organization below average for patient-centeredness. **Grade: C**
