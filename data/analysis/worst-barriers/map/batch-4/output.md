# Batch 4: Worst Barriers Analysis

## 1. Effectively Unfindable Forms

**ENT & Allergy Associates (D, independent for-profit practice, Northeast)** presents the single worst findability failure in this batch. Its ROI form is an orphaned 2009-era Word document at a URL linked from no website page. The practice has no "Patient Forms," "Medical Records," or "Request Records" section. Only a targeted `filetype:doc` search — a technique no typical patient would attempt — surfaces it. For a practice with 80+ offices across four states, this is a striking gap.

**University of Mississippi Medical Center (C, government teaching hospital, South)** compounds a findability problem with a broken link: the English-language form returns a 404 error. The only retrievable copy came from a third-party cache site after five different search strategies. A Spanish version exists on the Wayback Machine, but most English-speaking patients simply cannot obtain the form from UMMC's own website.

These are not oversights at small rural clinics — they are large organizations where patients have essentially no self-service path to begin a records request online.

## 2. Witness Signature Requirements

Three organizations impose witness signatures that HIPAA does not require:

- **DHR Health (C, for-profit regional hospital, South)** requires a witness on its Spanish form, alongside SSN collection, a liability waiver, and a form dated 2015. The cumulative effect is a form that discourages rather than enables access.
- **MUSC Health (B, nonprofit teaching hospital, South)** includes a witness line with no explanation of when it applies. Combined with a blanket ID requirement and prepayment language in its MyChart guide, the barriers add up.
- **Millinocket Regional Hospital (D, nonprofit CAH, Northeast)** pairs a witness line with an "ALL spaces MUST be completed" mandate, effectively making the witness mandatory. For a patient at home trying to request records, finding a witness is a real logistical barrier.

This pattern appears more commonly at smaller and Southern facilities, but MUSC shows it crosses into major academic centers too.

## 3. Missing Submission Instructions

A startling number of forms tell patients *what* to fill out but not *where to send it*:

- **ENT & Allergy Associates**: No address, fax, email, or portal on the form.
- **Arizona Community Physicians**: Primary ROI form contains zero submission instructions.
- **Colquitt Regional Medical Center (C, government community hospital, South)**: Single form with no fax, address, or email listed.
- **Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital (B, nonprofit major system, Midwest)**: Dedicated patient access form — one of the better-designed forms in this batch — yet omits all return instructions.
- **UMC of Southern Nevada (C, government community hospital, West)**: ROI form not even linked from the Medical Records page; the form itself has no submission guidance.

This is the most pervasive pattern in the batch. A patient who downloads, prints, and completes a form is then stranded with no next step. It appears across all organization types and seems driven by institutional indifference rather than intent.

## 4. No Patient Self-Access Form at All

**East Georgia Healthcare Center (C, nonprofit FQHC, South)** is the most extreme case: its only ROI form is designed for *incoming* records from other providers, with EGHC's address hardcoded as the destination. A patient wanting records *from* EGHC has literally no applicable form. The Notice of Privacy Practices acknowledges the right to access but provides no mechanism.

This goes beyond using a generic form — it is the complete absence of a pathway for the most basic patient right under HIPAA.

## 5. Excessive or Opaque Fee Structures

- **Lincoln Hospital (C, government CAH, West)** cites a Washington state fee schedule of $26 base + $1.17/page, likely exceeding HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access. The schedule references dates from 2017–2019 — expired but still printed on the form.
- **MUSC Health** mentions "search and duplication" fees for patient requests in its MyChart guide. HIPAA does not permit search fees for patient access. Prepayment is also required.
- **Lexington Clinic (C, for-profit practice, South)** charges $1.00/page for additional copies and imposes a $5.00 late fee — financial friction that goes beyond HIPAA's reasonable cost-based standard.

Fee barriers are particularly insidious because they discourage patients before they even submit a request.

## 6. SSN Collection and Outdated Forms

Multiple organizations request Social Security Numbers without justification: **DHR Health** (full SSN), **ENT & Allergy Associates** (full SSN on a 2009 form), **Piedmont Medical Center** (SSN on a form dating to pre-2010), and **UMMC** (full SSN). For forms submitted by fax or mail, this creates meaningful identity theft risk.

**Piedmont Medical Center's** forms date to 2013 and earlier, with unprocessed template merge fields visible. **ENT & Allergy Associates'** form predates the HITECH Act entirely. These are not just cosmetic issues — outdated forms may not reflect current regulatory requirements around information blocking and electronic access.

## Summary of Patterns

The most significant barriers in this batch cluster into three categories:

1. **Invisible process**: Forms that patients cannot find (ENT & Allergy, UMMC, UMC Southern Nevada) or that don't exist for the right purpose (East Georgia). This is the highest-severity barrier — it prevents the process from starting at all.

2. **Unnecessary procedural friction**: Witness requirements (DHR, MUSC, Millinocket), SSN collection, and excessive fees impose burdens HIPAA does not authorize. These appear more often at smaller and Southern facilities but are not exclusive to them.

3. **Missing last mile**: Forms that are findable and completable but provide no submission instructions. This is the most widespread pattern, appearing at organizations of every type and size, suggesting a systemic blind spot in form design rather than deliberate obstruction.

Across this batch of ~45 organizations, the dominant theme is **indifference rather than intent**. Most barriers stem from forms that were designed for internal HIM workflows and published online without considering the patient's end-to-end experience. The few organizations with dedicated patient access forms (Barnes-Jewish, Advocate Good Samaritan, UTMB, Flowers Hospital) consistently deliver better experiences — suggesting that the single most impactful improvement would be creating a purpose-built patient self-access pathway rather than repurposing third-party authorization forms.
