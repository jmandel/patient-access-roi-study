# Surprising Findings — Batch 23

## For-Profit Hospitals Outperform Expectations

The batch's only A grade belongs to Flowers Hospital (Dothan, AL) — a for-profit, CHS-affiliated community hospital. Its "Patient Request for Health Information" form titles "Myself" as the primary recipient option, offers 66 fillable AcroForm fields on a single page, includes a co-equal Spanish translation, and provides an online Swellbox portal as a digital alternative. For-profit Merit Health Central (Jackson, MS) also scores 4.15 with a dedicated patient access form and fillable fields. Meanwhile, major nonprofit teaching hospitals like UPMC Presbyterian (2.9) and University of Mississippi Medical Center (2.85) lag behind with non-fillable generic authorization forms. The narrative that for-profit hospitals prioritize revenue over patient experience doesn't hold here — at least for records access, for-profits in this batch sometimes outperform their nonprofit peers.

## Government Safety-Net Hospitals: A Split Personality

Government-owned hospitals show the widest quality range of any ownership type. JPS Health Network (Fort Worth, TX) — a major system hospital — earns just 2.45, with its core ROI form being a seven-year-old image-only scan, while its 2025 HIE forms are modern fillable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The synthesis narrative calls this "a choice rather than a limitation." At the opposite extreme, Valleywise Health (Phoenix, AZ) — also government-owned and independent — scores 4.0 with a dedicated bilingual patient access form and granular record-type selection. Neshoba General Hospital (Philadelphia, MS), another government facility, scores 1.2 with no online records pathway whatsoever, despite its employer authorization form demonstrating the technical capacity to produce fillable PDFs. Government ownership neither predicts excellence nor failure.

## The SSN Collection Problem Is Widespread

Nearly a quarter of organizations (47/190, 25%) collect Social Security Numbers on their ROI forms, despite HIPAA not requiring SSN for patient identification. This cuts across every facility type: major teaching hospitals (Barnes-Jewish requests full SSN; Duke, UMMC collect partial), small critical access hospitals (Lane County, Nemaha Valley), FQHCs (Addabbo, East Georgia, Anchorage Neighborhood), and physician practices (Baton Rouge Clinic requires full SSN as mandatory). Several organizations collect SSN on forms explicitly designed to be faxed or emailed — creating identity theft risk on inherently insecure transmission channels. The persistence of this practice suggests institutional inertia rather than any regulatory or operational need.

## FQHCs: Extreme Variance Despite Shared Mission

Federally Qualified Health Centers show the widest score range of any facility type (1.2 to 4.15). CrescentCare (New Orleans) earns 4.15 with bilingual forms, an online records request page, and "Myself via" as the lead recipient option. Philadelphia FIGHT scores 4.0 with separate patient access and third-party forms — a structural best practice. Yet Aaron E. Henry CHC (Clarksdale, MS) and Peoples Health Centers (St. Louis, MO) both score below 1.4 with no online records pathway at all. La Clínica de la Raza (Oakland, CA) — a major urban FQHC — has no ROI form online; the only documented pathway is mailing a letter to a P.O. Box. These are organizations sharing the same federal funding model and community health mission, yet their patient access infrastructure ranges from exemplary to effectively nonexistent.

## Samaritan Health's Rare EHI Export Form

Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital (OR) offers something almost no other organization in this batch does: a dedicated "Computer Readable EHI Export Request" form for machine-readable health data, available in English and Spanish. This directly implements the 21st Century Cures Act's information blocking provisions at the form level — a forward-looking practice that distinguishes Samaritan Health Services from peers who treat electronic records access as an afterthought. However, the form's own fine print notes it may charge fees, while the standard ROI form explicitly states "no charge" — an internal inconsistency that could confuse patients.

## Portal Gatekeeping as a New Barrier

Minnie Hamilton Health System (Grantsville, WV) — a rural critical access hospital — routes all records requests through ChartRequest, requiring account creation before patients can even see the authorization form. This creates a paradox: a modern digital platform that is less transparent than a downloadable PDF. Patients in rural West Virginia must create a third-party account with no visibility into fees, terms, or process before they can begin requesting their records. The synthesis calls this "a paradox: it has adopted a modern electronic records request platform, but in doing so has made the process less transparent and less accessible."

## The 73% Non-Fillable Problem

Across 190 organizations, 140 (73%) publish forms with zero fillable fields — even when the PDFs are born-digital. UPMC Presbyterian has 22 embedded fonts but exactly 1 interactive field. Advocate Good Samaritan and Aurora Medical Center (both Advocate Health system) publish dedicated patient access forms with clean vector graphics and 8+ fonts, yet zero fillable fields. The technical barrier to adding form fields is trivial; this is a design choice that forces a print-handwrite-scan workflow on patients who downloaded the form digitally in the first place. The gap between document creation capability and interactive form implementation is the single most widespread technical failure in this batch.
