# Surprising Findings — Batch 15

## A Community Health Center That Gets Pathway Differentiation Right

Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers — an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Philadelphia historically focused on HIV/AIDS care — demonstrates a level of HIPAA Right of Access sophistication that many large teaching hospitals and health systems fail to achieve. The organization maintains **separate, clearly labeled forms** for patient self-access ("Patient Request for Access to Information," citing § 164.524) and third-party release ("Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Information," a standard § 164.508 form). This structural separation is the single most patient-centered design decision an organization can make, and it's surprising to find it executed so cleanly at a small community health center rather than a major academic medical center.

What makes this doubly noteworthy is the **population-specific design intelligence** visible in the third-party form: granular opt-out categories for HIV status, mental health, and substance abuse information — categories of acute sensitivity for FIGHT's historically HIV-focused patient population. This isn't a generic form template; someone thought carefully about who would be using it and what could go wrong. The adolescent self-access provision (age 13+, reflecting Pennsylvania minor consent law) shows similar legal attentiveness.

Yet there's a puzzling gap: despite this thoughtfulness, the patient access form has **zero fillable PDF fields**. The document was clearly authored digitally (7 fonts, embedded logo, clean text layer), meaning adding form fields would have been trivial. The organization offers email submission — an unusually low-barrier digital channel — but the form itself still requires print-and-handwrite. This juxtaposition of process sophistication and document-level neglect is a pattern worth watching: organizations can get the *conceptual* design right while missing basic *technical* accessibility.

## A Rural Mississippi Hospital That Eliminated Paper Entirely

King's Daughters Medical Center (KDMC) in Brookhaven, Mississippi — a 122-bed independent community hospital — presents perhaps the most structurally unusual case in this batch. The organization has **no downloadable ROI form anywhere on its website**. In fact, the entire domain (kdmc.org) hosts only six PDFs total. Instead, KDMC has fully outsourced medical records requests to Datavant (formerly Swellbox), a third-party vendor platform.

For a small independent community hospital in rural southwest Mississippi, going fully digital for records requests is unexpected. This is the type of organization you'd expect to have a photocopied form behind the registration desk, not a professional SaaS-based request wizard. The approach represents a genuine leap — skipping the entire PDF-form era to land directly on an online workflow.

But this leap creates its own problems. The Datavant wizard uses a **per-page fee model** ($6.50 flat + $0.12/page) that HHS Office for Civil Rights has specifically criticized in Right of Access enforcement actions. The platform doesn't differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release, meaning patients exercising their HIPAA rights may be charged fees structured for insurer and attorney requests. The organization's Notice of Privacy Practices tells patients they can request their records but only says "Ask us how to do this" — offering no link to the online wizard, no phone number, and no concrete steps.

There's an ironic quality mismatch: KDMC's Notice of Privacy Practices is **one of the better-crafted NPPs** encountered — a single page, plain language, clear bullet points and section headers with patient-friendly examples. The organization demonstrably *can* produce accessible patient-facing documents. It simply hasn't produced the one document that matters most for patient access.

## Cross-Cutting Observation: Name Confusion as an Access Barrier

KDMC's retrieval was rated "hard" partly because of name confusion with an entirely separate King's Daughters Health System in Ashland, Kentucky. This is a subtle but real barrier: patients searching for "King's Daughters Medical Center medical records" may land on the wrong organization's forms. This name-collision problem likely affects other organizations with common names (e.g., "Memorial Hospital," "Community Medical Center") and represents an under-recognized findability barrier that has nothing to do with the organization's own website design.

## What Defied Expectations

Both organizations are independent nonprofits, but they defied category expectations in opposite directions. Philadelphia FIGHT, a small FQHC, showed the kind of regulatory sophistication (pathway differentiation, population-specific protections, state law compliance) typically associated with large health systems with dedicated compliance departments. KDMC, a rural community hospital, adopted cutting-edge vendor technology but stumbled on the fundamental compliance question of fee structures for patient access. The lesson: technological adoption and regulatory sophistication are independent axes, and organizations can be advanced on one while lagging on the other.
