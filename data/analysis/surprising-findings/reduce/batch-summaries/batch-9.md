# Surprising Findings — Batch 9

## The Remote Alaska Paradox: Perfect Findability, Contradictory Compliance

**Cordova Community Medical Center** (CCMC) — a 13-bed, government-owned critical access hospital in remote coastal Alaska — delivers the easiest form retrieval experience in this batch: a single web search, one click, direct PDF download (findability score: 5/5). For a tiny facility serving a remote coastal community with no IT department to speak of, this is remarkable. Many large urban systems with dedicated web teams can't match it. The lesson: simplicity scales down. A straightforward WordPress site with a clearly labeled "Medical Records" page under "For Patients" outperforms elaborate health system portals that bury the same information behind navigation mazes.

Yet the same form contains a striking internal contradiction. Section 3 bundles alcohol/drug abuse, HIV-AIDS, mental health, and psychiatric treatment into a single all-or-nothing initial — while the form itself cites **42 CFR Part 2**, the very federal regulation that requires *separate, specific* consent for substance abuse records. The form simultaneously acknowledges and violates the principle it references. This suggests the form was drafted by someone who knew the relevant regulations existed but either misunderstood them or copied boilerplate without adapting it. Similarly, the form cites **45 CFR 164.524** (the HIPAA right-of-access provision) — but only in the redisclosure warning, never to inform patients they *have* a right of access. The regulation that should empower patients is instead used only to limit what recipients can do with records.

The form's URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/`) and its own footer date (2016) suggest this document has been untouched for nearly a decade. For a critical access hospital with minimal administrative bandwidth, this is understandable — but it means the form predates significant HIPAA enforcement guidance on patient access rights issued in 2019.

## The Cross-State Records Office: Geographic Dislocation at Guthrie Corning

**Guthrie Corning Hospital** in Corning, NY, is part of the Guthrie Clinic regional system spanning Pennsylvania and New York. The most surprising finding here is geographic: patients at Corning Hospital who need help with medical records are told there is **no onsite medical records support**. Instead, they must contact Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA — a facility in a different state, roughly 30 miles away. Mail submissions go to "One Guthrie Square, Sayre PA 18840." For a patient in Corning who walks into their local hospital expecting to request their own records, being redirected across state lines is disorienting. This is a side effect of system centralization that the "system vs. facility" analysis framework might miss — the form is technically "available," but the human support infrastructure has been relocated.

## The Opt-Out Default for Sensitive Records

Both organizations handle sensitive health information in ways that default toward disclosure rather than protection. Guthrie's form is particularly notable: drug/alcohol records, HIV status, and mental health records are **released by default** unless the patient affirmatively checks boxes to exclude them. Genetic information is listed on the form with **no opt-out mechanism at all**. This opt-out framing puts the burden on the patient to know which categories are sensitive and to actively restrict them — the opposite of what privacy-protective design would suggest. Given that patients requesting their own records may not carefully parse every section before signing, the default-release approach means sensitive information could be disclosed in ways the patient didn't intend, particularly if the form is being used for third-party release rather than self-access.

## The Portal That Doesn't Help

Guthrie's instruction sheet mentions that "Continuation of care requests may also be completed thru your individual eGuthrie/MyChart account." This is a tantalizing hint of a digital pathway — but it explicitly limits the portal to continuation-of-care requests, excluding general patient access. A patient who discovers MyChart and assumes they can request their complete records through it will hit a dead end. The portal exists but is scoped too narrowly to serve the most common patient use case. This pattern — where a health system has invested in portal infrastructure but hasn't extended it to cover patient access rights — suggests that portal adoption and patient access are not the same thing.

## The $6.50 Bright Spot

Guthrie's companion instruction sheet discloses a **$6.50 flat rate** for personal-use electronic records, with no charge for provider-to-provider transfers. This is unusually transparent and clearly HIPAA-compliant. Most organizations in this study either don't mention fees at all or use opaque per-page pricing. The flat-rate electronic pricing model is exactly what the 2016 HIPAA fee guidance intended — but it lives in a separate instruction document rather than on the form itself, meaning a patient who only sees the authorization form won't know fees are this reasonable.

## Cross-Cutting Observation

Both organizations — despite vast differences in size (13 beds vs. 65), ownership (government vs. nonprofit), geography (remote Alaska vs. upstate New York), and system affiliation (independent vs. regional system) — share the same fundamental design flaw: their forms were built for third-party release, not patient self-access. Neither differentiates the two use cases. Neither references the patient's right of access under HIPAA. In both cases, a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly use a form designed for someone else to request records *about* them. This convergence across such different organizations suggests the "wrong form" problem is deeply embedded in healthcare culture, not a function of resources, geography, or organizational structure.
