# Surprising Findings — Batch 6

## The "Capable But Unwilling" Pattern: Organizations That Can Build Good Forms But Don't — For Patients

The most striking finding in this batch is a recurring pattern where organizations demonstrate clear technical capability to produce high-quality digital forms, then withhold that capability from the patient access pathway. **Mercy General Hospital** (nonprofit, major system, Sacramento CA) has a third-party authorization form with 42 fillable fields — but both of its patient access forms have zero fillable fields. The organization literally invested more design effort into forms that send records to *other people* than into the forms patients use to access their *own* records. **Neshoba General Hospital** (government, independent, Philadelphia MS) publishes a beautifully designed employer authorization form with 54 interactive fields on a clean single-page layout — yet publishes no patient-facing ROI form at all. The hospital has the infrastructure; it simply hasn't applied it to patient access.

This isn't random neglect. It suggests that patient self-access is systematically deprioritized relative to institutional workflows (employer authorizations, inter-provider transfers) that generate revenue or serve operational needs.

## A For-Profit System Hospital Outperforms Prestigious Nonprofits

**Flowers Hospital** (for-profit, Community Health Systems, Dothan AL) scores a 4.65/5 overall — a genuine A grade — with a dedicated patient access form titled "Patient Request for Health Information," "Myself" as the first recipient option, 66 fillable PDF fields, a co-equal Spanish translation, and an online portal via Swellbox. Meanwhile, **Michigan Medicine** (government teaching hospital, Ann Arbor MI, 1043 beds) — one of the nation's top academic medical centers — has zero fillable fields, an outdated 2011 form still publicly indexed, and ambiguous prepayment language. A 235-bed for-profit hospital in rural Alabama provides a demonstrably better patient experience than a billion-dollar academic medical center. This challenges the assumption that resource-rich, mission-driven institutions automatically produce better patient-facing tools.

## Physician Gatekeeping of Patient Access: An Active Barrier at a Major System

**Mercy General Hospital** builds physician veto mechanisms directly into its patient access workflow. Form-3 includes a "NOTIFICATION TO DOCTOR" section that solicits physician objections to releasing records, without informing the patient of any appeal rights. Both patient access forms require physician or caregiver approval before releasing HIV test results or psychiatric records *to the patient themselves* — a requirement that likely conflicts with HIPAA's right of access, which generally does not condition patient self-access on provider approval. This isn't a passive oversight; it's an active institutional choice to route patient access through a gatekeeper. This is particularly surprising at a CommonSpirit Health facility — one of the largest nonprofit Catholic health systems in the country.

## The Ghost Form Problem: System Templates That Don't Reach Local Hospitals

**Desert Valley Hospital** (for-profit, Prime Healthcare, Victorville CA) has no downloadable patient form on its own website. The only usable form was found on a *sister* Prime Healthcare hospital's website (Chino Valley Medical Center). A patient at Desert Valley would need to somehow discover the parent system, identify a sibling facility, and find that facility's form — or call the hospital and ask for a paper form. The underlying Prime Healthcare template is actually decent (47 fillable fields, clear rights section), but the local deployment failure renders it invisible. This "ghost form" pattern — where a system has standardized good forms but individual facilities fail to publish them — may be more common than it appears.

## An FQHC Designs for Its Population in Ways Others Don't

**Fenway Health** (FQHC, nonprofit, Boston MA) stands out for thoughtful population-specific design choices rarely seen elsewhere: a "Name used (if different)" field that accommodates patients whose current name differs from their legal name, reproductive health and gender-affirming care shield-law protections, and 10-category granular sensitive information controls. Most remarkably, Fenway publishes a separate 3-page FAQ guide that walks patients through every section of the ROI form in plain language — something no other organization in this batch does. However, even Fenway routes all requests through a generic third-party authorization form rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway, showing that good intent doesn't always translate into structural differentiation.

## Conditioning Language Leaking Across Form Types

**Barrett Hospital** (critical access, independent, Dillon MT) includes language warning patients that "refusal to sign may affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment" — conditioning language appropriate for certain third-party authorizations but legally problematic when applied to patient self-access requests. Because the hospital uses one generic form for all disclosure purposes, this coercive language is shown to every requestor. **Duly Health and Care** (physician practice, for-profit, Downers Grove IL) categorically rejects "all records" requests, which may improperly limit patient access under HIPAA's right to request one's entire designated record set. These aren't minor drafting oversights — they reflect a systematic failure to treat patient access as legally distinct from third-party release.
