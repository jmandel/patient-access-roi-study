# Batch 25 — Surprising Findings

## The Rural Underdog Outperforms the System Hospital

The most striking finding in this batch is the contrast between Pocahontas Memorial Hospital (PMH) — a 25-bed independent critical access hospital in Buckeye, West Virginia — and Anaheim Global Medical Center (AGMC), a 189-bed for-profit community hospital in Southern California backed by KPC Health's six-hospital system. Conventional expectations would predict that the system-affiliated, urban, better-resourced hospital would deliver a smoother patient access experience. The opposite is true.

PMH publishes a downloadable authorization form, offers five submission methods (in-person, mail, fax, email, phone), and explicitly lists electronic delivery formats including USB drive, CD, and portal — a remarkably forward-thinking set of options for a tiny rural facility. It includes a non-conditioning statement ("may not condition its providing of health care on whether copies… are released"), which is unusual for any provider but especially rare at small critical access hospitals. It also clearly states a 30-day response time.

AGMC, by contrast, publishes **zero** downloadable forms. Not a generic authorization, not a patient access form — nothing. The only document available is a 2016 Notice of Privacy Practices, which is not a request form at all. Patients who want their records must create an account with ChartRequest, a third-party commercial vendor, before they can even see what information is needed. The 189-bed system hospital scores a D (2.45); the 25-bed rural hospital scores a C (3.0).

## A Hospital That Has No Form At All

AGMC's complete absence of any downloadable ROI form is itself a surprising finding. Across this study, even poorly performing organizations typically publish *something* — a generic HIPAA authorization, a scanned legacy form, a fee schedule with instructions. AGMC's NPP references five internal forms ("record request form," "complaint form," etc.) that are apparently available only by visiting the Privacy Office in person, but none appear online. This creates an information asymmetry where the hospital knows what forms exist but the patient cannot access them remotely. For a facility in a multi-hospital system with shared IT infrastructure, this gap is hard to explain as mere oversight.

## Accidental Quality Signals in Unexpected Places

Both organizations exhibit a curious pattern: pockets of surprising quality embedded in otherwise mediocre documents.

**PMH's non-conditioning statement** stands out because it reflects awareness of a nuanced HIPAA provision (§ 164.508(b)(4)) that many larger, better-resourced hospitals ignore entirely. Someone at this rural West Virginia hospital either had strong compliance training or borrowed from a well-drafted template. Yet the same form has a systematic text encoding defect — the "ti" ligature is dropped throughout, rendering "Patient" as "Pa ent" and "authorization" as "authoriza on" — which would break screen readers and make the form inaccessible to visually impaired users. Compliance sophistication and technical quality are completely decoupled.

**AGMC's breach notification commitment** of 5 business days is dramatically faster than HIPAA's 60-day requirement, buried in an otherwise outdated NPP that predates the 21st Century Cures Act. This suggests the NPP was drafted by capable counsel at some point, but has been left to stagnate while the operational side of patient access deteriorated.

## The "Snowshoe Mountain Clinic" Mystery

PMH's form lists selectable record types including the expected clinical categories (History & Physical, Labs, Radiology, etc.) alongside "Snowshoe Mountain Clinic" — a facility name mixed in with content types. This likely reflects that PMH operates a satellite clinic at the Snowshoe Mountain ski resort, and the form was adapted to serve both locations. It reveals how small rural hospitals repurpose a single form across multiple sites, creating confusion for patients who may not know what "Snowshoe Mountain Clinic" means in the context of selecting medical record types.

## Defying Category Expectations

These two organizations challenge the assumption that system affiliation and resources predict access quality. PMH demonstrates that an independent, resource-constrained rural hospital can deliver a more patient-accessible experience than a system hospital — not through technology or design sophistication, but through basic availability: a downloadable form, multiple submission options, and clear response timelines. AGMC demonstrates that system infrastructure (shared portals, vendor relationships) can actually create new barriers when implemented without attention to the patient experience. The ChartRequest portal gates access behind registration, and the absence of any downloadable alternative means a patient without internet confidence or willingness to create a third-party account has no self-service option at all.
