# Batch 13 — Surprising Findings

## 1. A 17-Bed Rural Hospital Out-Innovates on Digital Access

The most striking finding in this batch is **Rio Grande Hospital** (Del Norte, CO) — a 17-bed independent critical access hospital serving a remote San Luis Valley community — offering embedded JotForm-based online record request submission on both its hospital and clinic pages. Critical access hospitals are typically resource-constrained facilities in rural areas, often the last to adopt digital workflows. Yet Rio Grande has invested in a dual-portal approach (separate JotForms for hospital and clinic patients), giving patients a fully digital alternative to its print-only PDF form. This defies the expected pattern where small rural facilities lag behind larger urban systems in digital infrastructure. For context, The Valley Hospital (Paramus, NJ) — a 370-bed community hospital that recently moved into an $868M facility and is named among Healthgrades' 100 Best Hospitals — has *also* transitioned to an online portal, but that is far less surprising for an institution of its scale and resources. The fact that a tiny rural hospital in Colorado's Rio Grande County arrived at a similar digital solution using an inexpensive third-party tool (JotForm) is genuinely noteworthy.

## 2. The SSN Collection Anomaly at a Small Nonprofit

Rio Grande Hospital's PDF form requests patients' Social Security Numbers as a standard identifier field alongside name and date of birth. For a records release form, SSN is unnecessary and creates identity theft risk — particularly concerning for a form that also provides **no submission instructions**, meaning a completed form with a patient's SSN could be mailed, faxed, or emailed to an unknown destination. This combination — SSN collection plus no submission guidance — represents an unusually poor risk posture. What makes it surprising is that this comes from a small independent nonprofit, not from a large bureaucratic system where such artifacts might persist through institutional inertia. The form was created in Word in 2018 and has apparently never been updated, suggesting a "set and forget" approach where the initial form design was never revisited.

## 3. The "Entire Record" Checkbox Trap

The Valley Hospital's VMG authorization form includes an "Entire medical record" checkbox that **silently excludes** Behavioral Health Specialist and Substance Use Specialist records unless those categories are also separately checked. This is a particularly deceptive barrier: a patient who checks "entire record" would reasonably expect completeness. The form doesn't warn that behavioral health records are excluded from "entire" — the patient would need to independently know to also check separate boxes. This may reflect New Jersey's heightened protections for behavioral health information, but the form design effectively makes completeness opt-in rather than default, while presenting an option that implies completeness. For a hospital of Valley's caliber (recently recognized as a top-100 hospital), this kind of misleading checkbox is unexpected.

## 4. The Orphaned Form Phenomenon

The Valley Hospital has effectively abandoned its PDF forms without formally retiring them. The hospital's medical records page now directs patients exclusively to an online request tool, but four PDF forms remain hosted at their original URLs — findable via search engines but no longer linked from the website. This creates a split experience: a patient who navigates the website gets the modern portal, while one who Googles "Valley Hospital medical records form" might find an orphaned PDF with no submission instructions and a potentially outdated fee structure ($1/page from a 2011 form). Notably, one of these orphaned forms is hosted on the MRO Corp vendor website (mrocorp.com), not even on Valley's own domain — meaning the hospital may not even control its removal. This raises an under-explored question for the study: how many organizations have outdated forms persisting on third-party vendor sites beyond their control?

## 5. Cross-Batch Pattern: The Generic Authorization Problem Spans All Sizes

Both organizations in this batch — despite vast differences in size (17 beds vs. 370 beds), geography (rural Colorado vs. suburban New Jersey), and resources — share the same fundamental flaw: neither has a dedicated patient access request form. Both use generic third-party authorization forms that require patients to designate themselves as both sender and recipient. Valley's form instructs patients to "just write SELF" as a workaround; Rio Grande's offers a "Personal Use" checkbox. These are band-aids on a form designed for a different purpose. The consistency of this pattern across such different organizations suggests it may be nearly universal, driven not by organizational characteristics but by the dominance of third-party authorization form templates across the healthcare industry.
