# Surprising Findings — Batch 11

## 1. The Only "A" Is a For-Profit Hospital in Rural Alabama

The single highest-scoring organization across all 190 isn't a prestigious teaching hospital or a well-resourced major system — it's **Flowers Hospital** (Dothan, AL), a 235-bed for-profit community hospital owned by Community Health Systems. It earned a 4.65/5 with a dedicated patient access form titled "Patient Request for Health Information" (not generic authorization language), 66 fillable fields on a single page, a co-equal Spanish translation, and a Swellbox portal. A for-profit chain hospital in rural Alabama outperforming every academic medical center and every nonprofit system challenges assumptions about which organizations invest in patient experience.

## 2. FQHCs: The Widest Quality Chasm in Any Category

FQHCs show the most extreme score variance of any facility type (std=0.88 vs. 0.40 for teaching hospitals). **CrescentCare** (New Orleans, LA, 4.15) and **Philadelphia FIGHT** (Philadelphia, PA, 4.0) — both independent nonprofits serving vulnerable populations — score in the top 10% overall. Both differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, offer electronic delivery, and provide bilingual forms. Meanwhile, **Aaron E. Henry CHC** (Clarksdale, MS, 1.2) and **Franklin Primary Health Center** (Mobile, AL, 1.35) have no online forms at all and require in-person visits. The organizations most structurally committed to health equity show the largest gap between best and worst patient access practices. Five of seven organizations requiring in-person submission are FQHCs.

## 3. Government Hospitals Cluster at the Bottom — With One Striking Exception

Government-owned hospitals average 3.08 (lowest of any ownership type). **Neshoba General Hospital** (Philadelphia, MS) and **Troy Regional Medical Center** (Troy, AL) score 1.2 and 1.75 respectively. Yet **Valleywise Health** (Phoenix, AZ) scores 4.0 — a government-owned, independent community hospital that maintains a dedicated bilingual patient access form (separate from third-party authorization), offers six delivery formats, and provides granular record-type selection. Valleywise demonstrates that government ownership needn't predict poor digital access; its Phoenix location and safety-net mission may drive bilingual investment that most government hospitals skip.

## 4. EHI Export: A Feature Almost Nobody Offers

Only 4 of 190 organizations mention EHI (Electronic Health Information) export — a machine-readable data format that lets patients upload records directly into another provider's EHR. **Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital** (Lebanon, OR) stands out with a *dedicated* EHI export request form available in both English and Spanish, distinct from its standard ROI form. **Owensboro Health** (Owensboro, KY), **Bayshore Medical Center** (Holmdel, NJ), and **Emory University Hospital** (Atlanta, GA) list it as a delivery option. Despite the 21st Century Cures Act requiring EHI access, 98% of organizations don't even mention it on their forms.

## 5. SSN Collection Persists at Alarming Scale

47 of 190 organizations (25%) collect Social Security Numbers on forms designed to be faxed or emailed — an unnecessary privacy risk since HIPAA doesn't require SSN for patient identification. **Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford** (Murfreesboro, TN) combines an SSN field with "ALL BLANKS MUST BE COMPLETED," implying mandatory collection. **Barnes-Jewish Hospital** (St. Louis, MO), a top-tier teaching hospital, requests full SSN with a last-4-digits fallback. This practice persists even among major systems that should know better.

## 6. The Findability–Quality Paradox

Several organizations show extreme gaps between how easy their form is to find versus how good it is. **Cordova Community Medical Center** (Cordova, AK) scores a perfect 5 on findability but only 2 on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness (gap of 3 points). **Prevea Health** (Green Bay, WI) mirrors this: findability 5, technical accessibility 2. These organizations made their forms easy to locate online but never invested in making them actually usable — the digital equivalent of a well-marked door that's locked.

## 7. Consent Bundling in Sensitive Records

16 organizations bundle sensitive-record consent (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS) into an all-or-nothing authorization with no opt-out. **Cone Health** (Greensboro, NC), a teaching hospital, forces patients to authorize release of mental health, substance abuse, HIV, genetic, and reproductive health records simply by signing — regardless of what was actually requested. This is particularly notable at organizations like **Abbeville Area Medical Center** (SC) and **Baptist Health Lexington** (KY), which serve populations in states with strong privacy expectations around sensitive health categories.
