# Surprising Findings: Cross-Batch Synthesis

## The For-Profit Paradox

The single A-grade organization across all 190 evaluated is Flowers Hospital in Dothan, Alabama — a for-profit community hospital owned by Community Health Systems (CHS), a chain more commonly associated with cost-cutting than patient-centered design. Its "Patient Request for Health Information" form lists "Myself" as the first recipient option, offers 66 fillable PDF fields on a single page, includes a co-equal Spanish translation, and provides an online Swellbox portal alternative. Its CHS sibling Merit Health Central in Jackson, Mississippi, scores 4.15 with the same standardized template. Meanwhile, elite academic medical centers — UCSF, Michigan Medicine, UPMC Presbyterian, the University of Mississippi Medical Center — all score in the C range or below. For-profit hospitals as a group average 3.28, essentially indistinguishable from nonprofits at 3.35.

This inversion challenges a foundational assumption: that mission-driven, well-resourced institutions naturally produce better patient-facing tools. The explanation appears to be standardization. CHS deployed a single high-quality template (HIM-1406) across its network, and every affiliated hospital benefits. Prestigious nonprofits, by contrast, leave form design to individual departments, where it competes for attention against clinical, research, and teaching priorities — and consistently loses. The finding suggests that patient access quality is driven less by institutional values than by whether someone, somewhere in the organization, decided to invest in a good template and deploy it systematically.

## The Organizations That Serve the Most Vulnerable Score the Worst

Federally Qualified Health Centers — created by Congress specifically to serve underserved populations — have the lowest average score of any facility type (2.96) and the widest variance. Five FQHCs offer no online records pathway at all: Aaron E. Henry CHC (Clarksdale, MS), Franklin Primary Health Center (Mobile, AL), People's Health Centers (St. Louis, MO), El Rio Health (Tucson, AZ), and La Clínica de La Raza (Oakland, CA). These organizations serve patients who disproportionately face transportation barriers, inflexible work schedules, and limited phone access — yet they are the ones requiring patients to call during business hours or visit in person just to learn how to request records.

The irony deepens at the individual level. Sea Mar Community Health Centers in Seattle — an FQHC founded to serve the Latinx community, whose name means "of the sea" in Spanish — offers only an English-language, non-fillable, apparently in-person-only form. Thirteen of 25 FQHCs lack multilingual forms despite serving populations where language access is a core mission requirement. El Rio Health's compliance booklet confirms it *has* internal ROI forms but has not made them publicly accessible. Patients are told to "Ask us how" to request records.

Yet the FQHC category also contains some of the study's best performers. CrescentCare in New Orleans (4.15) and Philadelphia FIGHT in Philadelphia (4.0) both maintain dedicated patient self-access forms, provide bilingual materials, and offer electronic delivery. Philadelphia FIGHT — historically focused on HIV/AIDS care — goes further, with separate forms for patient access and third-party release, 10-category granular sensitive-information controls, and an adolescent self-access provision reflecting Pennsylvania minor consent law. The gap between best and worst FQHCs is the widest of any facility type, suggesting that the problem is not inherent to the FQHC model but rather a matter of whether any individual at the organization has prioritized records access.

## They Can Build Good Forms — Just Not for Patients

The most revealing pattern across the entire study is what might be called the capability-deployment gap: organizations that demonstrably *can* produce high-quality digital forms choosing not to apply that capability to patient access. JPS Health Network in Fort Worth publishes modern, fillable 2025 HIE forms with encrypted email submission — but its patient ROI form is a 2018 image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields. Neshoba General Hospital in Mississippi produced a 54-field fillable employer authorization form but offers patients no records request form at all. Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers invested in a 22-field fillable incoming-records form for providers while leaving its patient-facing release form non-fillable and orphaned on an undiscoverable URL.

This is not a technology problem. It is a revealed preference about whose time matters. Organizations invest in forms that serve institutional workflows — employer authorizations, provider-to-provider transfers, insurance requests — because those workflows generate revenue or reduce operational friction. Patient self-access generates neither. The pattern is consistent across facility types, geographies, and ownership structures, suggesting it reflects a systemic deprioritization embedded in how healthcare organizations allocate form-design resources.

More broadly, 73% of organizations (140 of 190) publish forms with zero fillable fields, even when the PDFs are born-digital. UPMC Presbyterian has a PDF with 22 embedded fonts but exactly one interactive field. Ohio State Wexner Medical Center authored its form in Adobe Acrobat Pro and added zero fillable fields. These organizations have the tools; the gap between "digitally created" and "digitally usable" is a process problem, not a technical limitation. St. Charles Redmond in Oregon invested in a 65-field fillable PDF with bilingual support — then printed "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED" on it, invalidating its own digital-first design with a single policy decision.

## The Wrong Form Is the Default

Only 22 of 190 organizations (12%) offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The remaining 88% route patients requesting their own records through a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party disclosures — attorneys, insurers, other providers. This is not a technicality. Patients using third-party forms encounter expiration dates, purpose-of-disclosure fields, recipient designation boxes, and re-disclosure warnings that are legally irrelevant to their right of access under § 164.524. Organizations that average 3.88 with dedicated patient forms score 3.26 with generic forms. The seven organizations offering only phone or in-person pathways average a dismal 1.45.

The Baton Rouge Clinic illustrates the irony at its most acute: the clinic created a dedicated "Right of Access Form" explicitly citing HIPAA § 164.524 — more structural differentiation than most organizations attempt. Yet the form directs records "to: Name: ___" with no option for a patient to simply request their own records. The organization that came closest to getting the legal framework right still designed the form so the most common use case doesn't fit.

Texas Oncology's form contains a legally accurate footnote stating that the form itself "is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual." The form tells patients they don't need it — but provides no alternative.

## Small Rural Hospitals Punch Above Their Weight

The study's most counterintuitive performers are tiny critical access hospitals. Fallon Medical Complex in Baker, Montana (25 beds, serving a frontier region) offers seven delivery formats including USB drive, patient portal signup, and a "first copy free" policy. Gritman Medical Center in Moscow, Idaho, provides a 63-field fillable PDF with a "Major Documents for the Last 3 Years" shortcut for patients who don't know exact treatment dates. Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria, Oregon, explicitly states on its website that "records are free to patients who request their records" — fee transparency that is vanishingly rare. Wayne County Hospital in Monticello, Kentucky (25 beds) offers both a downloadable PDF and a web-based submission form, and prints the state's free-first-copy statute directly on the form. Cordova Community Medical Center in remote coastal Alaska earns a perfect findability score: one search, one click, direct download.

These facilities consistently outperform much larger institutions. Wayne County (3.65) beats UPMC Presbyterian (2.9). Gritman (3.75) matches or exceeds most teaching hospitals. The pattern suggests that simplicity is an advantage: small organizations with bare-bones websites and straightforward processes can outperform complex health systems where the form is buried behind navigation mazes, portal walls, and competing institutional priorities.

## Spanish-Speaking Patients Get a Worse Deal

Multilingual support, where it exists, frequently creates a two-tier system. DHR Health in Edinburg, Texas — in the Rio Grande Valley, where roughly 90% of the population is Hispanic — offers both English and Spanish forms. But the English form is a digitally authored PDF with 37 fillable fields and a full text layer, while the Spanish version is an image-only scan with no text layer, no fillable fields, and different legal terms: a liability waiver, a witness signature requirement, and a 180-day expiration clause that do not appear on the English form. Spanish-speaking patients using the form designed for them are subject to more onerous conditions than English-speaking patients at the same facility.

Desert Regional Medical Center's Spanish translation contains at least nine typographical errors and omits the delivery method section entirely — Spanish-speaking patients literally cannot indicate how they want to receive their records. Columbia Memorial Hospital's Spanish form is eight years older than its English version, with page 2 entirely untranslated. Northwestern Medicine's Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version, missing hospital renamings and updated regulatory language. The pattern is consistent: translation is treated as a one-time project, not an ongoing maintenance obligation. English forms get updated; translations silently fall out of sync.

## What These Findings Suggest

Three implications stand out. First, patient access to medical records is not primarily a technology problem — it is a priority problem. The tools to create fillable, findable, patient-centered forms are widely available. Organizations that score well did not deploy exotic technology; they simply decided that patient access mattered enough to design for it. The capability-deployment gap proves this: the same organizations that neglect patient forms demonstrate clear technical competence on forms that serve institutional needs.

Second, the safety-net inversion — where organizations serving the most vulnerable populations provide the least accessible records request processes — suggests that federal funding and mission statements alone do not translate into patient-facing operational quality. FQHCs that excel (CrescentCare, Philadelphia FIGHT) appear to have been shaped by specific population needs (HIV/AIDS care, LGBTQ+ health) that made privacy and access design existentially important. Generic mission language about "underserved communities" has not produced the same effect.

Third, the for-profit standardization advantage raises uncomfortable questions about how healthcare organizations allocate design resources. CHS achieved the study's best patient access form not through patient-centered values but through operational efficiency: one good template, deployed everywhere. If a for-profit chain can achieve this incidentally, the failure of mission-driven organizations to do so intentionally is a choice that deserves scrutiny.

The 88% of organizations funneling patients through the wrong form, the 73% offering zero fillable fields, the 25% collecting Social Security Numbers without legal basis, and the 88% providing no fee transparency — these are not edge cases. They describe the default experience for patients seeking their own medical records in the United States. The surprising finding is not that some organizations do poorly. It is that doing poorly is the norm, and the exceptions come from the least expected places.
