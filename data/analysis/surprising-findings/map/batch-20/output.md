# Surprising Findings — Batch 20

## Spanish-Speaking Patients Face Different Legal Terms at DHR Health

The most striking finding in this batch is a substantive equity gap at **DHR Health** (Edinburg, TX), a 500-bed physician-owned for-profit system in the Rio Grande Valley where approximately 90% of the population is Hispanic/Latino. The Spanish authorization form is not simply a translation of the English version — it imposes materially different legal terms. The Spanish form includes a **liability waiver** asking patients to release the hospital from "all legal liability and any harm" from disclosure, and it adds a **witness signature requirement** — neither of which appears on the English form. The Spanish version also defaults to a 180-day expiration while the English form has no expiration clause at all. This means Spanish-speaking patients using the form designed for them are subject to more onerous conditions than English-speaking patients at the same facility. In a community this form is specifically meant to serve, that disparity is deeply concerning.

Compounding this, the Spanish form is a flat image-only scan (produced on a Konica Minolta copier) with no text layer, no fillable fields, and spelling/grammar errors, while the English form has a text layer and 37 fillable fields. The technical quality gap creates a second tier of inequity: Spanish-speaking patients cannot fill the form digitally, cannot use assistive technology, and cannot search the document text.

## Award-Winning Hospital Has No Form of Its Own

**Minnie Hamilton Health System** (Grantsville, WV) is a 25-bed independent nonprofit critical access hospital that won a Top 20 CAH award in 2023. Despite this recognition, it has **no facility-branded ROI authorization form**. The only ROI form found through extensive searching belongs to affiliate Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — a different organization roughly 3 hours away. A patient trying to request records from this nationally recognized small hospital cannot find the correct form to do so.

## The Portal Opacity Paradox

Minnie Hamilton also illustrates a counterintuitive pattern: adopting modern digital infrastructure can actually reduce transparency. The facility directs patients to **ChartRequest**, a third-party portal that provides a fully electronic submission workflow (earning a technical accessibility score of 4/5). Yet the portal requires mandatory account creation before patients can see the authorization form, understand what information is needed, learn about fees, or review any process details. The result: a technically sophisticated pathway that scores only 2/5 for content design and 2/5 for findability because it hides everything behind a registration wall. Digital-first design is not inherently patient-centered.

## A Decade-Old Form at a 500-Bed System

DHR Health still uses a form dated August 2015, branded with its former name ("Doctors Hospital at Renaissance"), to serve over 280,000 patients annually. The form requires a full Social Security Number with no indication it is optional — a significant identity theft risk given that submission is by fax or mail. It also asks patients to state a "purpose" for requesting their own records, which HIPAA does not require for individual access, without noting the field is optional. For a physician-owned system of this size, the failure to modernize a patient-facing document over a decade is unexpected.

## Defying Category Expectations

Both organizations in this batch defy expectations for their type. DHR Health, as a **physician-owned** system, might be expected to design more patient-centric processes — yet its form is generic, outdated, and imposes unnecessary barriers. Minnie Hamilton, despite its **award-winning reputation** and adoption of modern platforms (ChartRequest, Athena Health), fails to provide basic transparency about its records request process. Neither organization differentiates between patient self-access under HIPAA § 164.524 and third-party authorization — a gap that is common across the study but particularly notable given their respective resources and recognition.
