# Surprising Findings — Batch 12

## The Largest Nonprofit Hospital in America Still Treats Patients Like Third Parties

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) — the largest nonprofit hospital in the United States with 2,600 beds, affiliated with both Columbia and Weill Cornell — delivers a technically impressive records request system that nonetheless reveals a fundamental conceptual gap. The hospital built a 103-fillable-field interactive PDF (one of the most technically capable ROI forms in the study), offers it in English, Spanish, and Chinese, created a dedicated phone line with a clever vanity number (646-NYP-4ROI), and provides six delivery methods including free portal access. Yet this same form lists "Patient Request" as one of seven checkboxes alongside "Life Insurance," "Legal Purposes," and "Worker's Comp." The form warns that "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records" — language that is accurate for third-party releases but flatly wrong for patient self-access under HIPAA § 164.524, where a signed authorization isn't even required. An institution with this level of resources and technical sophistication choosing to conflate patient access with third-party release is not a capability gap — it is a conceptual one. The form's designers apparently never asked: "Is a patient requesting their own records fundamentally different from an insurance company requesting them?"

## Portal-Level Differentiation Without Form-Level Follow-Through

NYP's Verisma portal landing page separates Patient, Patient Representative, and Attorney workflows — a genuinely thoughtful UX choice that most organizations don't attempt. But this differentiation evaporates at the paper form level. The same "Tripartite" HIPAA authorization serves everyone. This creates an odd inversion: the digital pathway is more patient-aware than the paper pathway, suggesting that portal vendor design (Verisma) may be driving patient-centeredness more than institutional policy. It raises a broader question for the study: when we see good patient differentiation, is it the hospital's doing or the vendor's?

## A Regional Tennessee System Out-Designs an Elite Academic Medical Center in One Dimension

Maury Regional Health, a 255-bed community system in Columbia, Tennessee, makes a small design choice that NYP does not: it lists "Myself" as the *first* option in the recipient field and "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox. This is a subtle signal that self-access is the expected use case, not an afterthought. Meanwhile, NYP — with 10× the beds, an Ivy League affiliation, and vastly more resources — buries patient self-access among seven coequal checkboxes. Maury also offers four delivery formats including USB flash drive and encrypted email with a proactive security disclosure — options that reflect genuine thought about how patients actually want to receive records. On raw scores, NYP (B, 3.75) outperforms Maury (C, 3.3), but the gap in patient-centeredness thinking is narrower than the institutional prestige gap would predict.

## The Hold Harmless Problem Appears Even in Patient-Friendly Forms

Maury Regional's form includes a hold harmless clause requiring patients to release the facility from liability for complying with the authorization. HIPAA does not permit conditioning patient access on signing a liability waiver. What makes this surprising is that Maury's form is otherwise quite patient-friendly — clean single-page layout, "Myself" prioritized, multilingual, multiple delivery channels. The liability clause appears to be boilerplate inherited from third-party release forms, inserted into a document that otherwise shows genuine effort toward patient accessibility. This suggests that problematic legal language persists even in well-designed forms because form creators copy forward legacy clauses without evaluating whether they apply to patient self-access.

## The Spanish Form Time Warp

Maury Regional provides a Spanish-language form — commendable for a mid-size Southern community hospital. But the Spanish version (dated 05/2017) is over a year older than the English version (08/2018) and is missing content present in the English form: no Social Security/Disability purpose option and no Photo ID section. This isn't just a translation lag; it means Spanish-speaking patients have a materially different (and inferior) form experience. The pattern suggests that multilingual support is treated as a one-time translation project rather than an ongoing maintenance commitment — forms get updated in English, and the translations silently fall out of sync.

## Two-Photo-ID Portals as a New Digital Barrier

NYP's Verisma portal requires *two* forms of photo ID for electronic submission. While identity verification is reasonable, requiring two photo IDs exceeds typical HIPAA expectations and may disproportionately exclude patients who lack multiple government-issued photo documents — precisely the populations (elderly, low-income, undocumented) who most need electronic access alternatives. Combined with the mandatory date-of-service range (records won't be released without specific dates), NYP's digital pathway introduces new friction even as it removes old friction. The portal giveth and the portal taketh away.
