You are exploring org-level synthesis results for a study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Org-level synthesis files (synthesis.md narratives and scores.json structured data)
for a batch of organizations are included inline below. Read with fresh eyes.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city). Use this to notice when orgs defy expectations for their type.

Your task: identify anything surprising, unexpected, or noteworthy that doesn't fit
neatly into the other analysis categories (best practices, barriers, portals, etc.).
What patterns or individual findings would you want to tell someone about?

Write your findings to "output.md". Be specific and cite organizations.

# Labette Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Labette Health is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Parsons, Kansas. It takes a notably digital-first approach to medical records requests: rather than offering a downloadable PDF authorization form, it routes patients to an **online Formstack form** accessible directly from the main website navigation. This places Labette Health ahead of many peers who still rely on print-and-mail PDF workflows.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents were downloaded during the search, but **neither is Labette Health's actual ROI form**:

- **form-1.pdf** — A generic one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" template from PatientPop, hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It does not mention Labette Health anywhere and surfaced only as a misleading search result. It has no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and is missing core HIPAA authorization elements.
- **form-2.pdf** — Labette Health's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), effective November 2021. This is an informational compliance document, not a request mechanism. It does reference the right to inspect and copy records and the right to an electronic copy, but does not link to the actual request form.

The **primary and only pathway** for requesting records is the Formstack online form at `https://labetteheatlh.formstack.com/forms/medical_records_request` (note: the subdomain contains a typo — "labetteheatlh" instead of "labettehealth"). The Contact Us page also mentions visiting the office in person as an alternative.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Labette Health's Formstack form **does differentiate** between patient self-access and third-party release. It includes a "Release direction" field with "to Patient/Self" as an explicit option alongside "Other," and a "Relationship to patient" field that includes "Patient/Self" as the first choice. While it is a single form serving multiple purposes rather than a dedicated patient-only form, the self-access pathway is clearly accommodated — a patient does not need to guess which parts apply to them.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating the website directly; standard web searches returned only the irrelevant PatientPop template. The website blocks simple HTTP fetches (returns 403), necessitating browser-based navigation. However, once on the site, the form is **easy to find**: the main navigation under "Patients & visitors" contains a direct "Medical records request form" link. The Contact Us page also links to it. Overall retrieval difficulty is **moderate** — the form is well-placed on the website but invisible to search engines and requires browser access.

## Form Document Quality

The Formstack form is a strong digital-first implementation:

- **Fully interactive**: All fields are fillable online with no printing required
- **Electronic signature**: Includes a signature pad for digital signing
- **Comprehensive record types**: 15+ specific checkboxes (COVID-19, Abstract, Clinic Note, Discharge Summary, EKG/Stress Test, ER Record, H&P, Lab Results, Operative Report, Radiology CD/Report, Sleep Study, Vaccination History, etc.)
- **Date range**: Includes date(s) of service field
- **Email delivery**: Offers an email delivery option for receiving records
- **Photo ID upload**: Built-in identity verification via file upload
- **Sensitive information**: Explicit exclusion options for mental health, communicable diseases, and drug/alcohol records
- **HIPAA language**: Standard authorization language including 1-year expiration, right to revoke, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warning

The layout is structured with clear sections and the field count (~15-20 fields) is reasonable for a comprehensive records request.

## Barriers and Compliance

No unnecessary barriers were identified. There is no notarization requirement, no witness requirement, and no mandatory in-person submission. The form submits electronically upon completion. The NPP mentions that copies may incur a "reasonable fee" but provides no specific amounts — this is standard HIPAA language but leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **Digital-first, no-paper workflow**: Among the most modern approaches observed for a community hospital of this size
- **Patient self-access clearly supported**: "Patient/Self" is an explicit option, not an afterthought
- **Comprehensive NPP**: Includes an unusually detailed Kansas HIT/HIO section and complete Privacy Officer contact information (name, address, phone, email)
- **Email delivery option**: Patients can request records via email, going beyond the typical CD or paper delivery

## Weaknesses and Concerns

- **URL typo**: The Formstack subdomain "labetteheatlh" (missing an "h") is fragile — if corrected upstream, existing links would break
- **No PDF alternative**: Patients without reliable internet access have no downloadable form option (only in-person office visit)
- **NPP doesn't link to the form**: The NPP tells patients to "complete a specific form" to exercise access rights but never identifies which form or where to find it
- **Website blocks automated access**: 403 errors on HTTP fetches could impact accessibility tools or screen readers that rely on direct URL access

## Overall Assessment

Labette Health provides a genuinely patient-centered, digital-first records request experience that stands out for an independent community hospital. The Formstack form is well-designed, comprehensive, and clearly accommodates patient self-access. The main gaps are the lack of a PDF fallback, the URL typo, and the disconnect between the NPP and the actual request mechanism. Overall, this organization earns a **B grade** — above average in technical accessibility and patient-centeredness, with minor findability and disclosure gaps preventing a top score.

# Cuba Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cuba Memorial Hospital is a small, independent critical access hospital in Cuba, NY, affiliated with the Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) alongside Olean General Hospital (OGH) and Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC). The hospital does not publish its own medical records request form. Instead, patients must discover and use ROI forms from affiliated UAHS facilities, found on a separate organization's website.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two forms were retrieved, both from the BRMC-OGH website (brmc-ogh.org), not from Cuba Memorial's own site:

- **Form 1 (OGH)**: "Authorization for Patient Access and/or Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," branded for Olean General Hospital. This is the most relevant form since both OGH and Cuba Memorial are New York facilities within UAHS.
- **Form 2 (BRMC)**: Nearly identical form branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Less relevant due to cross-state jurisdiction, but its blank disclosing-organization field makes it theoretically more adaptable.

The hospital's website also mentions a "YourHEALTH" patient portal for electronic record access, but no ROI form or formal request process is linked from the portal page.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are dual-purpose: their title explicitly covers both "Patient Access" and "Use and Disclosure." Section 4 includes dedicated checkboxes for patient inspection or copies, alongside a third-party release authorization line. This is a modest positive — the form acknowledges patient self-access as a use case rather than treating it as an afterthought. However, the form is fundamentally a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all release purposes, not a dedicated patient access form. A Cuba Memorial patient must also contend with the fact that neither form mentions their hospital by name, creating real confusion about which form to use and where to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was moderately difficult. Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website has no medical records page, no patient forms section, and no downloadable ROI form. Multiple search strategies — including site-specific searches, direct navigation, and sitemap review — yielded nothing. The forms were only discovered by following a small footer link from Cuba Memorial's site to the BRMC-OGH website, then navigating to the medical records page. A patient would need to recognize this footer link as relevant, navigate a different organization's site, and infer that the "OGH" form applies to their Cuba Memorial records — a non-obvious multi-step process.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are 2-page, digitally produced PDFs with text layers — not scans. However, neither has fillable fields (fillable_field_count: 0). Patients must print and complete them by hand. The forms use a numbered seven-section structure (authorization statement, disclosing organization, record types, recipient/patient access, patient rights, expiration, specially protected information) that provides reasonable organization. Approximately 15 fields require completion for a patient self-access request.

The language is moderately legalistic but generally comprehensible. Patient rights statements in Section 5 cover voluntariness, no treatment impact, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, and right to copies. However, a typo in Section 5(c) — "but in do" instead of "but if I do" — has persisted across both forms since at least 2017, suggesting the templates are unmaintained.

## Barriers

- **No clear submission pathway**: The forms provide no instructions for how to submit them. The bolded statement "Photo ID is required for records to be picked up" implies in-person pickup as the expected or only delivery method. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or online submission option is mentioned on the form or the BRMC-OGH medical records page.
- **Witness lines**: Dedicated witness signature lines appear without indication of whether witnessing is required or optional, potentially deterring patients from submitting unwitnessed forms.
- **90-day expiration**: Authorization expires after 90 days, which is unnecessary for patient access requests under HIPAA's ongoing right of access.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) mentions "a reasonable copy fee" with no specifics or fee schedule reference.
- **Outdated forms**: Both forms were last revised in January 2017, predating Information Blocking rules and 21st Century Cures Act implementation.

## Strengths

- The form explicitly contemplates patient self-access with dedicated inspection/copies checkboxes — relatively uncommon among generic authorization forms.
- Granular record type selection (11 categories with date ranges) gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.
- Appropriate handling of specially protected information (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) with separate consent checkboxes consistent with New York law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Overall Assessment

Cuba Memorial Hospital presents significant access challenges for patients seeking their own records online. The hospital publishes no form of its own, requiring patients to navigate to an affiliated organization's website and use a form branded for a different hospital. The forms themselves, while structurally adequate and notably inclusive of patient self-access checkboxes, are non-fillable, outdated, and provide no guidance on submission or delivery methods. The implied requirement for in-person pickup with photo ID — potentially at a facility 30+ miles away — represents a meaningful barrier for a rural critical access hospital population. The overall experience falls short of patient-centered design, earning a grade of C.

# Arizona Community Physicians — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Arizona Community Physicians (ACP) is an independent, for-profit physician practice group in Tucson, Arizona. The organization maintains a well-organized patient forms page at azacp.com/forms/ with seven downloadable PDFs covering general records release, practice-specific release, imaging-specific release, adult/minor access designation, a Spanish minor access form, and a HIPAA amendment request. Critically, ACP also offers an online electronic records self-request wizard through Swellbox (swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html), providing a modern digital pathway alongside the paper forms.

## Relevant Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1.pdf** — the general "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (Form 100, revised 08/26/2024). However, ACP also provides the **Swellbox online wizard**, which is the superior pathway for a patient who wants to submit a request electronically without printing, hand-filling, and physically delivering a paper form. The forms page links to both options, giving patients a choice.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

ACP does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release, with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields that frame the transaction as a provider-to-provider or provider-to-entity transfer. The "TO" field is labeled "Name of Physician/Organization," implying the recipient should be another provider rather than the patient. A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name and address in that field, but the form provides no guidance for this use case. The purpose checkboxes include "At request of Patient," which at least acknowledges patient-initiated requests, but the form structure does not differentiate the legal framework (HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524 vs. authorization under § 164.508).

The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, may offer a more patient-centric experience as an electronic self-request tool, though its exact workflow was not evaluated as a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding ACP's forms was **easy**. The Patient Forms page is linked from the main website navigation, and multiple search strategies (web search, site-specific search, direct navigation) all returned direct PDF URLs. No login, bot blocking, or browser fallback was needed. The forms page is clearly organized and lists all seven documents. The Swellbox wizard link is also present on the forms page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF** with a native text layer. Despite being revised in August 2024, it has zero fillable fields — all blanks are underscore placeholders requiring printing and handwriting. The layout is clean and logically organized with capitalized section headers (PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM/TO, PURPOSE, TYPE OF INFORMATION). The language is generally plain and accessible, though the fee disclosure is confusingly placed as a footnote under the "Other" purpose checkbox rather than in its own section. The form collects a reasonable set of fields (~12-15 blanks) without requesting a Social Security Number — a positive privacy practice. It includes a "Former Name" field, which is a thoughtful inclusion.

The form offers three delivery format options (paper, disc/PDF, email), though email is restricted to "medical records processed by CIOX" without explaining what that means. The two-tier record type structure appropriately separates general records from protected records (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse) with distinct consent checkboxes.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness requirements.** Fees are disclosed at $0.07/page and $6.50/disc — both modest and within HIPAA limits — though "additional charges for shipping and handling" are mentioned without quantification. The one-year authorization expiration is standard. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated.

The most significant barrier is the **absence of submission instructions** on form-1 itself — no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal URL. A patient who downloads and prints the form has no idea where to send it. This is a functional defect. By contrast, form-7 (amendment request) includes explicit mail, fax, and in-person delivery instructions. The Swellbox wizard partially mitigates this by offering an entirely separate electronic pathway, but form-1 doesn't reference it.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox electronic self-request wizard** provides a modern digital alternative to the paper form ecosystem
- **Comprehensive form suite** — seven distinct documents covering diverse patient needs, including imaging-specific and amendment request forms
- **Spanish-language minor access form** (form-6) demonstrates language access awareness appropriate for Tucson's ~42% Hispanic population
- **No SSN collection** on the primary ROI form
- **Protected records separation** with distinct checkboxes for HIV, behavioral health, and substance abuse
- **HIPAA amendment request form** published online — uncommon among practices

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient self-access form** — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization
- **No fillable fields on any form** — all seven PDFs are flat, print-and-fill documents
- **No Spanish version of the primary ROI form** (form-1), despite Spanish availability for the minor access form
- **Missing submission instructions** on the primary ROI form
- **Fee disclosure placement** is confusing (buried under "Other" purpose checkbox)
- **1-year default records limitation** may surprise patients seeking complete history

## Overall Assessment

ACP demonstrates above-average organizational effort in making patient forms accessible online, with a well-organized forms page, a comprehensive suite of documents, and — crucially — a Swellbox electronic self-request option that elevates the patient experience beyond the paper-form baseline. However, the primary ROI form itself is a generic third-party authorization that doesn't distinguish patient self-access, lacks fillable fields, and omits submission instructions. The availability of the Swellbox pathway is the key differentiator that lifts ACP's overall assessment, though the paper form ecosystem could benefit from modernization and better patient-access-specific design.

# Copley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Copley Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Morrisville, Vermont. The hospital offers a single Release of Information form — titled "Patient Request for Health Information Authorization Form" (Form 1085, dated 07-21) — that serves as the primary pathway for patients seeking their own health records. No patient portal–based request option or online submission wizard was identified; the form is a downloadable PDF linked from the hospital's Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Copley's form is a **dual-purpose authorization** that handles both patient self-access and third-party release on a single page. The form includes a clear checkbox for "Provide a copy of my records to: Me," which meaningfully distinguishes the patient self-access use case — but it does not separate this pathway from third-party release. A patient requesting their own records encounters fields irrelevant to their situation, such as "Release my Records TO:" (with recipient name, address, fax, and phone fields) and "Purpose of Release." Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not state a purpose for requesting their own records, so the presence of this field — without clarification that it's optional for self-requests — could confuse or deter patients.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the phrase "Right of Access." While the authorization language (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure warning) is well-written, the form frames the interaction as an *authorization* rather than an *access right*, which is a conceptual distinction that matters for patient-centeredness.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Copley Hospital's release of information form immediately surfaced a direct link to the PDF. The form is also prominently linked from the Medical Records page under "For Patients + Visitors" in the main site navigation. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was required. The hospital's Medical Records page also links to three related HIPAA forms (amendment request, alternate communication, PHI restrictions), which shows a thoughtful information architecture even if the ROI form itself is the only one relevant to record requests.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page PDF** — impressively compact — with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → delivery/format options → authorization scope → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. The language is largely plain and accessible, with standout phrasing like "My treatment will not be impacted, no matter if I sign this Authorization or not."

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). This means patients must print and hand-fill the form, then fax or mail it back. The delivery and format options are notably strong — in-person pickup, mail, fax, and patient portal for delivery, plus paper copy or electronic copy (email, USB, CD, portal) for format — and the form helpfully notes that "Many documents that you may be requesting are available to you in your patient portal." But the submission process itself requires either fax (802-888-8361) or mail to the HIM department.

## Barriers & Compliance

**No notarization or witness** is required. Representative signers must attach proof of authority, which is a reasonable requirement. The authorization is valid for one year with clear revocation instructions including both mailing and fax addresses.

**Fees are not mentioned** anywhere on the form, leaving patients unable to anticipate costs. This is a notable gap — HIPAA requires transparency about fees for patient access requests.

The form is dated July 2021 and predates the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective April 2023), suggesting it may not reflect current requirements around electronic health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- **Comprehensive delivery and format options** — email, USB, CD, patient portal, fax, mail, and in-person pickup
- **Single-page efficiency** — all necessary content on one page
- **Clear voluntariness statement** in plain language
- **Easy findability** — prominent placement and search-engine accessible

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** — forces a paper workflow despite digital authorship
- **No fee disclosure** — patients cannot anticipate costs
- **"Purpose of Release" field** not flagged as optional for self-requests
- **No explicit Right of Access framing** — treated as authorization rather than access right
- **Form staleness** — over 4 years old, predating information blocking rules

## Overall Assessment

Copley Hospital provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience anchored by easy findability, a compact single-page form, plain language, and strong delivery/format options. The dual-purpose design accommodates patient self-access but doesn't optimize for it. The primary weaknesses — lack of fillable fields and absence of fee disclosure — represent missed opportunities rather than active barriers. Fax submission is available, providing an adequate electronic pathway. For a small critical access hospital, this is a competent if imperfect effort that would benefit from modernization: adding fillable fields, separating or clearly labeling the self-access pathway, and disclosing fee information.

# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Three PDF forms were found for Carle BroMenn Medical Center, a community hospital in Normal, IL that is part of the Carle Health regional system:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary general ROI authorization form specific to the BroMenn/Normal campus (form code X3833-0820). One page. Covers Carle West Physician Group, Carle BroMenn Medical Center, and Carle Eureka Hospital.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A nearly identical system-level Carle Health ROI form for the Champaign campus (form code 174-0319). One page. Same structure but branded for the main Carle campus HIM department.
3. **form-3.pdf** — A behavioral health–specific authorization form for the BroMenn campus (form code X3852-0620). Two pages. Required separately for mental health records per Illinois law.

**Form-1 is the most relevant document** for a patient at Carle BroMenn Medical Center requesting their own general medical records. Form-2 serves the Champaign campus and would likely confuse a BroMenn patient. Form-3 is a companion form needed only for behavioral health records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Carle BroMenn does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" documents designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios. The form uses "To Send to" / "To Request from" framing, requiring patients to navigate a form designed for inter-provider transfers, legal disclosures, and insurance requests. There is no streamlined form or process specifically for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

That said, the form does include some patient-oriented elements: delivery via MyCarle Account (the patient portal), an explicit citation of CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access regulation), and a clear statement that signing is not required for treatment.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches surfaced direct PDF download links on carle.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or multi-step navigation was required. The carle.org medical records page links to the forms. All three were directly downloadable via curl. The only minor friction: a patient might encounter both form-1 (BroMenn-specific) and form-2 (Champaign-specific) without clear guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **digitally-authored but non-fillable PDF**. Despite being created digitally (not a scan), it has zero interactive form fields — every field must be filled by hand after printing. This is a significant missed opportunity. The form is well-organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of release → delivery method → record type selection → legal terms → signature. The granular record-type checkbox grid (30+ categories across hospitalization and clinic columns) gives patients meaningful control over scope. However, the single-page design makes the form cramped, with small font (estimated 8–9pt for legal text) and limited write-in space.

The language is a mix of clear and legalistic. Legal disclaimers are reasonably comprehensible but dense. The "ATTENTION: This is a legal document" warning is somewhat intimidating. There is no plain-language summary.

## Barriers

- **Purpose of disclosure required**: The form requires patients to state why they want their records — a requirement that is potentially non-compliant with HIPAA's Right of Access, which prohibits requiring a reason for patient self-access requests.
- **SSN field not marked optional**: Asks for last 4 digits of SSN without indicating it can be left blank.
- **Paper-only workflow**: No fillable fields, no fax number for submission, no email submission. A patient must print, handwrite, and mail the form or deliver it in person.
- **Behavioral health witness requirement**: Form-3 requires a witness signature for both the authorization and revocation — a barrier not required by HIPAA.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: States "there may be a charge" with no amounts. Form-3 mentions ScanStat as the third-party vendor processing requests.
- **No notarization required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — mail is an option.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyCarle Account electronic delivery** for records (30-day window) provides a digital delivery pathway even though the request itself is paper-based.
- **Explicit HIPAA citation** (CFR 164.524) — uncommon and commendable transparency about patient rights.
- **Granular record-type selection** gives patients fine-grained control over what is released.
- **Easy online findability** of forms with direct download links.
- **Appropriate behavioral health protections** including 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language and age-appropriate consent (12+ for mental health).

## Overall Assessment

Carle BroMenn Medical Center provides a functional but dated records request process. The forms are easy to find and reasonably well-organized, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of electronic submission options, and generic authorization design that doesn't differentiate patient self-access from third-party release hold it back. The purpose-of-disclosure requirement is a compliance concern for patient access requests. The organization earns credit for MyCarle Account delivery, explicit rights citations, and granular scope controls, but the fundamentally paper-based workflow and generic form design place it in the middle of the pack for patient-centeredness.

# Merit Health Central — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Merit Health Central is a for-profit community hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, part of Community Health Systems (CHS) operating under the Merit Health brand. The facility uses system-standardized forms for records requests and also offers an online portal alternative via Swellbox. Two PDF forms were retrieved — English (HIM-1406) and Spanish (HIM-1406S) versions of the same document — both linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page.

## Available Pathways & Primary Form

The primary form (form-1.pdf, HIM-1406) is titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** — notably not "Authorization for Release" or similar third-party-oriented language. The form allows patients to request records for themselves, a personal representative, or a third party, with "Myself" listed as the first recipient option. A Spanish translation (form-2.pdf, HIM-1406S) with identical structure and 66 fillable fields is provided alongside. The website also offers an online request process via Swellbox (swellbox.com/merit-health-jackson-wizard.html), giving patients a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Merit Health Central does not maintain separate forms for patient self-access vs. third-party release — both use cases are served by the same HIM-1406 form. However, the form is clearly designed with patient self-access as the primary use case: the title, structure, and "Myself" first-option framing all signal a patient-access orientation. The form explicitly distinguishes recipients (self, personal representative, third party) with labeled options. This is a meaningful step above the generic third-party authorization model, even though a truly separate patient access pathway does not exist.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/request-medical-records`. The page sits under "Patients & Visitors" navigation with clearly labeled English and Spanish download links. An FAQ section addresses common questions about authorization, charges, and who can request records — providing useful context before the patient downloads anything. No bot-blocking or browser fallback issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a born-digital, single-page interactive PDF with 66 fillable fields — an exceptionally high count that means virtually every input area is digitally completable. The layout follows a logical seven-section flow: patient information, facility identification, record type selection (12 checkbox categories), sensitive information disclosure (5 categories with individual opt-in checkboxes), delivery method selection, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and direct, with clear section headers framed as patient-facing questions. The one-page format is impressively concise given the coverage.

The form offers five delivery methods: paper, email (with risk acknowledgment), removable media (DVD/USB/CD-ROM with password protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media with password protection is an unusually thoughtful option. The HIPAA acknowledgment in the footer — "This Healthcare Facility recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information" — explicitly references patient rights, though it could be more prominent.

## Barriers & Concerns

No major barriers were identified. No notarization is required, there is no in-person-only submission requirement, and the form avoids consent bundling. However, three ambiguities merit attention: (1) fee disclosure is vague — "There may be charges" with no amounts, schedules, or reference to HIPAA cost-based limits; (2) the form itself does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization (no fax number, email, or mailing address on the form); and (3) a witness signature field is present without explanation of when a witness is required, which may confuse patients completing the form remotely.

## Notable Strengths

The Spanish translation is a genuine bright spot — a fully functional, equally prominent parallel form rather than an afterthought. The Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital alternative for patients who prefer not to deal with PDF workflows. The patient-first titling and structure, comprehensive delivery options, and high fillable field count collectively demonstrate above-average attention to patient access needs. The system-standardized form (revised six times since 2018) suggests ongoing maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Merit Health Central provides a well-above-average patient records request experience. The combination of a patient-focused PDF form, Spanish translation, and online Swellbox portal covers multiple access modalities. The form's digital-first design, logical layout, and comprehensive options serve patients well. Minor shortcomings — vague fee language, missing submission instructions on the form itself, witness field ambiguity — prevent a top-tier rating but do not materially impede patient access. This is a solid B-level performance.

# NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) provides a well-organized, multi-channel records request system anchored by a system-wide "Tripartite" HIPAA authorization form shared across NYP, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medicine. Three documents were retrieved: the primary Tripartite ROI form (form-1), a patient-facing FAQ (form-2), and an older Lawrence campus-specific variant (form-3). The organization directs patients primarily to a Verisma online portal, with MyChart and paper form submission as alternatives.

## Access Pathway & Differentiation

NYP offers genuine differentiation at the pathway level: the medical records page provides separate Verisma portal links for Patient, Patient Representative, and Attorney workflows. This is a meaningful distinction that helps patients identify their correct route. However, the underlying authorization framework remains generic — the paper form (form-1) is a single HIPAA authorization used for all disclosure types, with "Patient Request" as one of seven checkboxes alongside Life Insurance, Legal Purposes, and Worker's Comp. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish the legal framework for patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization section states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records," which is accurate for third-party releases but misleading for patient access requests, where HIPAA requires only a written request, not a signed authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records) leads to a well-organized page. Web searches readily surface both the medical records page and direct PDF links. The form is hosted on a digital asset management platform (nyp.widen.net), which initially served an HTML viewer rather than the raw PDF, requiring some effort to extract the actual download URL. This is a minor friction point for an otherwise easy retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is technically excellent. It is a born-digital, fully interactive PDF with 103 fillable fields — one of the most technically capable ROI forms in this study. The 2-page form follows a logical flow through patient demographics, recipient information, disclosing entity selection (covering all 11 NYP campuses plus outpatient groups), granular record-type checkboxes (16+ options including "Entire Medical Record"), sensitive information authorization (compliant with New York state law for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing), six delivery methods, and a numbered authorization section. The layout is clean with bold section headers, though the density of content on two pages results in small text in places. The authorization language includes some compound legalese that is difficult to parse, but the overall organization is strong.

The form is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese — a notable accommodation for New York City's diverse population.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on the primary form (though the older Lawrence form-3 includes a "Witness or Notary" line). The Verisma portal requires two forms of photo ID, which exceeds typical HIPAA identity verification expectations and may exclude patients without two scannable photo IDs. The form mandates a date-of-service range, stating "records will not be released unless Date of Service section is complete" — a potential barrier for patients seeking their complete longitudinal record. Fees are described as "reasonable fees to recover costs," tracking HIPAA's statutory language without specifying amounts. No response time commitment appears on the form or FAQ.

## Notable Strengths

NYP's system stands out for its dedicated phone line (646-NYP-4ROI, M-F 8am-6pm), multilingual form availability, comprehensive FAQ document with transparent MyChart record-type listings, and the sheer technical quality of the fillable PDF. The six delivery options — paper, fax, email, CD, flash drive, and patient portal (at no cost) — give patients meaningful choice.

## Overall Assessment

NYP delivers a technically strong, well-organized records request experience with good findability and multiple access channels. The main weakness is the lack of a truly patient-access-specific pathway: despite portal-level differentiation, the underlying form treats patient self-access as one use case among many without acknowledging the distinct legal rights involved. The two-photo-ID portal requirement and mandatory date-of-service range create unnecessary friction. Overall, this is a solid B-level experience — above average in technical execution but falling short of patient-centered design.

# Valleywise Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valleywise Health Medical Center, a government-owned independent community hospital in Phoenix, AZ, provides a notably patient-centered approach to medical records access. The organization maintains two distinct PDF forms: a general third-party authorization (Form 43439) and a dedicated patient access request form (Form 45643). This two-form architecture is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement, clearly separating patient self-access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Valleywise Health is among the organizations that get this right. Form 45643 — "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — is explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It does not require the patient to name a third-party recipient, does not include a purpose/reason field, and does not carry an expiration clause — all appropriate design choices for a one-time patient access request. Meanwhile, Form 43439 handles third-party disclosures with the appropriate authorization infrastructure (recipient designation, purpose selection, expiration, revocation rights). The organizational intent to differentiate is clear and well-executed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` returned direct PDF URLs. The organization's patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` also links to the forms. Both PDFs were publicly accessible from a standard WordPress media directory with no bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication. The descriptive filenames (e.g., `Form-45643-Patient-Request-For-Access-To-Protected-Health-Information_ENG_SPA.pdf`) make it clear which form is which.

## Form Document Quality

Form 45643 is a 2-page bilingual PDF (English page 1, full Spanish translation page 2). The layout is clean with a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection → date range → delivery format → recipient information → processing details → signature. The form offers an impressively granular record type selection with 16+ specific categories (discharge summary, H&P, nursing notes, operative reports, pathology, radiology, etc.) plus an "All Records" option. Delivery options include MyChart patient portal, paper copy, CD, USB, email, and fax.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a digitally-authored document. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the form's clean layout would translate well to interactive PDF fields. Submission is available via fax (602-655-9017) and email (ROI@valleywisehealth.org), providing adequate electronic pathways, but the print-and-handwrite step creates friction in an otherwise well-designed process.

The language is plain and accessible throughout, with clear instructions ("Please check (✔) the appropriate box(es) (❑) and fill in the blank(s) as needed") and a patient-friendly tone ("We appreciate your patience while we process your request").

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization, witness, or in-person requirements exist. The form states a HIPAA-compliant 30-day response timeline with a possible 30-day extension. Fee disclosure is vague — "Valleywise Health may charge a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing a fee schedule, though the language about "actual cost of the portable media" aligns with HIPAA's cost-based limits.

Two concerns stand out. First, the form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient access requests and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed or emailed. Second, the Spanish translation references "documento 43780" instead of the correct Form 43439, potentially sending Spanish-speaking patients searching for a nonexistent form.

## Notable Strengths

The standout features are the **full bilingual (English/Spanish) form** — not a summary but a complete parallel translation, appropriate for Phoenix's demographics — the **dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release, and the **granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control over their request scope. The email encryption transparency, defaulting to encryption with an informed opt-out, is a thoughtful touch.

## Overall Assessment

Valleywise Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its medical records access process. The dedicated patient access form, bilingual design, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options reflect genuine attention to the patient experience. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a paper-first completion workflow despite otherwise modern design sensibilities. The SSN field and Spanish-version cross-reference error are notable but secondary concerns. This is a well-designed system with room for straightforward technical improvements.

# Duke University Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Duke Health provides four documents related to records release. The most relevant for a patient requesting their own records is **form-4.pdf** (M3132, Rev. 3/2025), the current enterprise-wide Authorization for Release of Information. This is a single-page, fillable PDF with 67 interactive fields, hosted on a well-organized medical records landing page. The companion **form-2.pdf** is a 3-page plain-language instruction sheet walking patients through each section of the authorization. Form-1 is an older revision of the same M3132 form (Rev. 4/2024) that remains accessible at a stale URL, and form-3 is an image-only scan of an even older revision posted on a satellite Duke outpatient clinic site — both are superseded and inferior to form-4.

Duke also mentions that Spanish-language versions are available on the official forms page, and the forms page links to additional documents (verbal release form, proxy access form, external records request).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Duke does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The M3132 authorization is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to serve both patient self-requests and third-party releases (attorneys, insurers, other providers). However, the form accommodates patient access reasonably well: Part B includes a "Self (Same Info As Above)" checkbox, Part D lists "Personal" as the first purpose option, and Part E prominently features "My Duke Health (Patients Only)" as a delivery method. The companion instructions explicitly address patients requesting their own records ("If you are the patient and are requesting the records be sent to you, select 'Self'"). While functional, a patient must still navigate sections designed for third-party scenarios, and the form doesn't distinguish the differing legal frameworks (Right of Access vs. Authorization) that apply to each case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy** — rated as a 2-click path from the Duke Health homepage (Medical Records → Authorization Forms). The official forms page is clearly titled, well-organized, and lists all available downloads. Web searches readily surface direct PDF URLs. The only retrieval concern is stale URLs: the older form-1 revision remains accessible via search engines, and a satellite Duke site hosts an image-only scan (form-3) that was uploaded as recently as June 2024 despite being from 2022.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the current primary form, is a strong digital-first artifact. It contains **67 fillable interactive fields** on a single page — enabling patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing. The layout follows a logical six-part structure (Patient Info → Recipient → Records to Release → Purpose → Delivery Format → Review/Approval) with clear section headers. The record-type selection offers excellent granularity: 14+ individual report categories, treatment date ranges, and facility-specific or enterprise-wide options. Sensible defaults are transparently stated ("Last 2 years of active treatment will be provided unless specified"). The language is generally clear and functional, though the legal disclosure text in Part F is dense. The companion instruction document (form-2) defines each medical record type in accessible language — an unusually thorough support resource.

## Barriers and Concerns

Duke imposes no notarization requirement; the witness section from the older revision has been removed entirely. Submission channels are robust: email, fax, and mail, with a phone number for questions. No in-person requirement exists. However, several issues merit attention:

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number — not required by HIPAA and an unnecessary privacy risk when medical record number and date of birth are also collected.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Duke Health may charge a fee" with "Charges may apply" noted for CD and paper delivery, but no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Patients must affirmatively check boxes for Mental/Behavioral Health and Genetic Testing to receive those portions of their own records — arguably a barrier for patient self-access, where HIPAA grants access to the complete designated record set. The form mentions HIV/AIDS in the text but provides no corresponding checkbox, creating ambiguity.
- **Unnamed form fields**: All 67 fillable fields lack descriptive names, creating an accessibility gap for screen reader users.

## Strengths

Duke excels in several areas: multiple electronic delivery options (MyChart patient portal, encrypted email, fax), granular record-type selection, companion instructions with plain-language medical definitions, multiple submission channels, and a clean digital-first form design. The existence of a separate instruction document with a helpline number demonstrates genuine investment in patient guidance. Electronic delivery options are listed first in Part E, signaling a preference for digital fulfillment.

## Overall Assessment

Duke University Hospital provides a well-organized, technically competent records request experience anchored by a strong fillable PDF form and excellent companion documentation. The primary limitation is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization designed for all release scenarios. The form handles patient self-requests adequately through its "Self" checkbox and "Personal" purpose option, but doesn't inform patients of their Right of Access or distinguish the simpler patient-access legal framework from third-party authorization. Minor concerns around SSN collection, vague fee disclosure, and sensitive-information opt-in prevent a top-tier rating, but overall this is an above-average experience.

# Mayers Memorial Hospital District — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were found for Mayers Memorial Hospital District, a government-owned critical access hospital in Fall River Mills, California:

1. **form-2.pdf** — A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" branded with the hospital's name, adapted from the California Hospital Association template (CHA 16-1, March 2013). This is hosted directly on the hospital website but critically mislabeled as "Disclosure of Privacy Practices" in the site navigation. It is the hospital's primary ROI authorization form (form number MMH 470).

2. **form-1.pdf** — A 1-page generic, unbranded "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN. It was found only through web search and is not linked from any page on the hospital website.

For a patient requesting their own records, **form-2.pdf is the most relevant** — it is the branded hospital form, includes a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose, and contains a substantive "My Rights" section. However, both forms are fundamentally structured as third-party release authorizations.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mayers Memorial does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms require patients to fill in a recipient's name and address, meaning a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own contact information as the "recipient." Form-2 partially acknowledges patient self-access through a "Patient request" checkbox, but the workflow remains identical to a third-party release. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding a usable form was **difficult**. The hospital's Medical Records page provides only department hours and a phone number — no downloadable form, no request instructions. The branded form (form-2) is linked from the Patients & Visitors page under the misleading label "Disclosure of Privacy Practices," a title that describes an entirely different type of document. A patient looking for a records release form would likely skip this link. The generic form-1 is only discoverable through external web search leading to a third-party CDN URL.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-2** (the primary form) is an **image-only scan** with no text layer and no fillable fields. It cannot be searched, copied from, or read by screen readers — a significant accessibility failure. Despite the poor digital format, its content is reasonably well-structured: clear section headers, checkboxes for record scope (all records vs. specific types), granular sensitive-information checkboxes (mental health, HIV, substance abuse) each requiring initials, and a "My Rights" section written in plain first-person language. Estimated field count is approximately 15 fields across 2 pages.

**Form-1** has a text layer (digitally created) but also lacks fillable fields and is far less complete — no checkboxes, no scope options, no rights statement, and no HIPAA-required authorization elements (expiration, revocation).

Neither form provides any submission instructions — no fax number, mailing address, email, or portal link. A patient who completes the form has no documented path to submit it without calling the hospital.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions on either form**: The most critical barrier — patients cannot determine how to return a completed form.
- **Image-only scan** (form-2): Completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.
- **Intimidating opening language** (form-2): "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — potentially chilling for patients who lack details like their MRN.
- **Mislabeled web link**: The form is hidden behind an incorrect label, making it effectively unfindable through normal navigation.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form addresses whether fees will be charged.

## Bright Spots

- The "My Rights" section on form-2 is genuinely well-written in plain first-person language, clearly stating patients' rights to refuse, inspect records, and revoke authorization.
- Sensitive information handling is properly separated with individual checkboxes and initial lines, compliant with California law and 42 CFR Part 2.
- Use of the CHA template ensures baseline legal compliance with California health privacy requirements.

## Overall Assessment

Mayers Memorial provides a below-average patient experience for records access. While the branded form has decent content design rooted in its CHA template, the combination of extremely poor findability, an image-only scan format, absent submission instructions, and no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release creates a frustrating and largely inaccessible process. A patient attempting to request their own records online would struggle at every step — finding the form, reading it with assistive technology, understanding how to complete it for self-access, and figuring out where to submit it.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MUSC Health University Medical Center in Charleston, SC is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina health system. The organization provides three pathways for patients to request their medical records: a downloadable PDF authorization form, MyChart patient portal, and an online Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool. Three documents were retrieved: the English authorization form (form-1), a MyChart instructional guide (form-2), and a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway Assessment

MUSC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary pathway is a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form that serves both patient access and third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same "Release Records From" / "Release Records To" framework designed for third-party disclosures, filling in their own name as both patient and recipient — an unintuitive experience. The form includes "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" as one of eight purpose-of-release checkboxes, but patient self-access is not called out as a distinct pathway.

However, MUSC partially compensates by offering the MyChart portal pathway, where patients can submit records requests electronically. The MyChart guide (form-2) describes a step-by-step process for requesting records within the portal, though it prominently warns about fees and a prepayment requirement. The Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool is a third option but requires webcam identity verification, adding friction.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A standard web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL at a clean, descriptive path (`muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf`). The medical records landing page links directly to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. The Spanish version was similarly accessible at a predictable URL. This is a model of straightforward form availability.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a significant shortcoming given that the form offers modern delivery options like encrypted email and MyChart. The form was clearly designed digitally (9 fonts, clean layout) but not built for digital completion.

The layout follows a logical progression: patient demographics → records source/destination → record types → purpose → date range → delivery method → legal disclosures → signature. The record-type options are well-designed, including a helpfully defined "Abstract" option. Five delivery methods are offered (mail, MyChart, fax, encrypted email, other) — above average for ROI forms. However, page 1 is dense, with legal disclosures compressed into a wall of small-print text at the bottom.

Language is a mix of plain instructions and legal/regulatory terminology. The opening warning ("FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION") is clear but intimidating. Rights disclosures reference specific CFR sections, which is appropriate but not patient-friendly.

## Barriers and Concerns

Several barriers exist. The form requires a **witness signature** — a line with no explanation of when or whether it's required, likely confusing patients into thinking it's always mandatory. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests. The form also requires attaching **a copy of patient identification** for all requests, not just representative requests — an extra step that adds friction for patients without easy copier access. The request for the **last 4 digits of SSN** is unnecessary for patient identification and may deter some patients.

The fee situation is a notable red flag. The MyChart instructional guide explicitly states that fees apply to "all patient requests released to the patient" including "search and duplication" — HIPAA only permits reasonable cost-based fees (not search fees) for patient access requests. The guide also describes a **prepayment requirement** before records are released, which may conflict with HHS/OCR guidance on patient access rights.

## Bright Spots

MUSC demonstrates genuine effort in several areas. The **Spanish-language form** (form-3) is a full professional translation preserving the complete structure and content of the English original, with bilingual headers — uncommon among organizations in this study. **Multiple pathways** (PDF, MyChart, Ciox eRequest) give patients genuine choice. **Multiple delivery methods** including encrypted email show digital awareness. The **multi-facility contact directory** on page 2 provides complete information for 9 MUSC locations, and the form explicitly references **45 CFR §164.524** (right to inspect/copy), making HIPAA rights visible to patients.

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health earns a **B grade** overall. The organization makes forms easy to find, offers multiple request pathways and delivery options, provides a Spanish-language version, and includes patient rights language. However, the generic third-party authorization form is not designed around patient self-access, the PDF lacks fillable fields despite digital distribution, and the fee/prepayment language raises compliance concerns. The witness signature and blanket ID requirements add unnecessary barriers. A dedicated patient access form with fillable fields and clearer fee disclosures would meaningfully improve the patient experience.

# Sturdy Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Sturdy Memorial Hospital (Attleboro, MA) publishes two PDF authorization forms on its website, both titled "Authorization to Release Health Information." Form-1 (updated January 2025, form code SM00081 10/24) is the current, actively maintained version — a 2-page fillable PDF with 59 interactive fields. Form-2 is an older (~2017) legacy version of the same document with zero fillable fields, outdated terminology ("Venereal Disease"), and defunct department references. Form-2 remains publicly accessible, creating a risk that patients download the wrong version. There is no redirect, banner, or other mechanism steering patients to the current form.

No online portal, patient portal integration, or third-party vendor (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was identified for records requests. The only documented pathway is downloading and completing the PDF authorization form, then submitting it — presumably by mail or fax, though the form itself does not specify a submission method. The hospital's mailing address (211 Park Street, PO Box 2963, Attleboro, MA 02703-0963) is listed in the revocation instructions.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Sturdy Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both form versions are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms structured around a three-party model: the patient authorizes Provider A to release records to Provider B. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in the "Release of Protected Health Information To" field — an unintuitive workaround that the form does not explain. The "Purpose of Disclosure" checkboxes include "Personal," the closest match for self-access, but this option is neither highlighted nor explained. The form does not reference the patient's HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), nor does it mention the right to inspect or obtain copies of one's own records as a distinct use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search immediately surfaced both PDFs as direct links on sturdyhealth.org. No website navigation was needed. However, Akamai CDN bot protection blocked programmatic downloads (curl returned "Access Denied"), requiring a browser-based JavaScript workaround to retrieve the raw PDF bytes. This would not affect a typical patient using a web browser but could impede assistive-technology or API-based access.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

The current form is a standout in technical execution. With 59 fillable fields, it is comprehensively interactive — patients can complete the entire form electronically without printing. The PDF is a native digital document (no scanned images, full text layer, 221 KB file size). The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → authorization source/recipient → sensitive information categories → purpose of disclosure → record types → rights → signature. The form uses clear section organization across its 2 pages.

Language is mixed: the rights section uses accessible plain English ("I may refuse to sign this authorization and that such refusal will not affect my health care"), while the sensitive information and disclosure sections are more legalistic. No plain-language summary or introductory guidance is provided. The form is English-only.

Record-type granularity is a notable strength — approximately 14 categories with individual date-range fields (medical record abstract, clinic visit notes, emergency room, lab reports, radiology, pathology, operative reports, etc.), giving patients meaningful control over scope. Sensitive information categories (mental health, HIV/AIDS, STD, sexual assault, substance abuse, genetic testing) require individual initials, respecting Massachusetts law and patient autonomy.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **90-day hard expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signature, with no option to specify a custom date (the older form-2 allowed this). Given HIPAA's 30-day processing window with a possible 30-day extension, this leaves a narrow margin.
- **Ambiguous witness requirement**: A "WITNESS" line appears at the bottom of page 2 with no instructions on whether a witness is required. Patients may unnecessarily delay submission while seeking a witness.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs for records copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No electronic delivery option**: No checkbox for email, portal, or electronic format delivery of the requested records.

## Bright Spots

- **59 fillable fields** — exceptional among ROI forms, most of which have zero interactive fields. Clearly a deliberate digital-first design decision.
- **Granular record-type selection** with ~14 categories and date ranges.
- **Individual sensitive-information consent** via initials for each category.
- **Active form maintenance** — the January 2025 update shows ongoing attention.
- **No notarization requirement**, no consent bundling, and clear right-to-refuse language.

## Overall Assessment

Sturdy Memorial Hospital delivers a technically excellent form that falls short on patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF with granular record selection is among the best form documents in its class, but the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway means patients must navigate a third-party release form to exercise their Right of Access. The form's structure, language, and field design all orient toward provider-to-provider or provider-to-insurer disclosure rather than patient self-access. Combined with ambiguities around witness requirements, submission methods, and a restrictive expiration, the experience is functional but not patient-centered.

# Piedmont Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Piedmont Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Rock Hill, SC, affiliated with Tenet Healthcare. Two authorization forms were found: a one-page hospital-specific form (form-1) and a two-page physician network form (form-2). The organization also contracts with Datavant and offers Swellbox online portals for both patient and provider record requests, which represents the most patient-friendly pathway.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The hospital's "Request Medical Records" page at piedmontmedicalcenter.com/patients/request-medical-records serves as the central hub, linking to: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (form-1), and (2) a Swellbox/Datavant online portal for patient record requests. A second PDF form (form-2) exists on the affiliated Piedmont Physician Network website but is not linked from the hospital's main medical records page.

Form-1 is the primary PDF document for hospital record requests. It is a single-page "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" form (EZ-7003, revised 2013). The Swellbox portal, however, is likely the pathway the organization most actively directs patients toward for digital submission.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither PDF form is a dedicated patient-access form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 does include a "Self" checkbox under the PURPOSE section, acknowledging that a patient may be requesting their own records, but the form's framing ("I authorize Piedmont Medical Center to disclose the following information...") and structure assume a third-party recipient scenario. Form-2 is even more clearly a third-party release form, with fields for "Name of Person or Class of Persons who may disclose" and "To release records to" — a structure that makes no sense for self-access.

The Swellbox portal provides a meaningful alternative. By offering separate portals for patient and provider requests, the organization does create some differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — though this differentiation exists at the portal level, not in the PDF forms themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately returned the medical records page URL and direct PDF links. The medical records page is well-organized and clearly labeled. The only technical hurdle was Cloudflare bot protection blocking automated downloads, requiring browser-based retrieval — a hosting infrastructure issue that could also affect assistive technologies.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1** (primary hospital form) is a non-fillable PDF with zero interactive fields. Despite having labeled fields for patient name, date of birth, address, and various checkboxes for record types, all are static text requiring print-and-fill completion. The form is compact at one page with a logical layout organized into PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION REQUESTED, PURPOSE, and INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO sections. Record type options are granular, with 14+ checkboxes covering specific document types plus a write-in option.

The language is moderately legalistic, particularly the liability release and re-disclosure clauses. Template merge fields (`«PatientNumberBarcode»`, `«PatientName»`, etc.) are visible at the bottom of the public PDF, indicating an unprocessed template extracted from the hospital's document management system — confusing for patients and unprofessional in appearance. A typo ("in ability" for "inability") in the legal representative attestation is concerning for a legal document.

**Form-2** (physician network form) is more comprehensive at two pages but also entirely non-fillable. Its standout feature is granular opt-in checkboxes for seven categories of highly confidential information (mental health, psychotherapy notes, HIV/AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, sexual assault, child abuse/neglect). However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, carries no organizational branding, has a date field locked to "200_" (rendering one term option unusable since 2010), and provides no Privacy Office contact information.

## Barriers and Compliance

Neither form requires notarization or in-person submission. Neither mentions fees. Both include standard HIPAA disclosures: revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure warnings. Form-1's six-month default expiration is reasonable. The liability release clause on Form-1 — releasing the hospital "from any legal responsibility or liability" — is unnecessary for patient self-access and could discourage patients from exercising their rights. Both forms are notably outdated (2013 and pre-2010 respectively), predating significant regulatory updates.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** for patient record requests provides a modern digital pathway beyond the paper forms
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear organization and multiple access options
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** (14+ options on form-1) give patients meaningful control
- **Granular sensitive information opt-in** on form-2 (seven separate categories) represents strong practice

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — both PDFs are generic third-party authorization forms
- **Zero fillable fields** on either form — entirely print-and-fill
- **Severely outdated forms** (one from 2013, one from pre-2010)
- **Visible template merge fields** on form-1 indicate an unprocessed internal template
- **SSN requested** on form-2 (unnecessary privacy risk)
- **Liability release clause** on form-1 (inappropriate for patient self-access)

## Overall Assessment

Piedmont Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional patient records request experience. The organization's investment in a Swellbox/Datavant online portal significantly improves the digital pathway, compensating for PDF forms that are entirely paper-oriented and outdated. The medical records page is easy to find and well-organized. However, the underlying PDF forms show their age — neither has been updated in over a decade, neither offers fillable fields, and neither is designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. The organization earns a B grade, buoyed by the portal alternative and reasonable findability, but held back by paper-era form design and a generic authorization approach that doesn't center patient access rights.

# Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cottage Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Woodsville, NH, affiliated with the Rowe Health Center outpatient clinic. Two documents were retrieved: a standalone one-page "Authorization for Disclosure of Medical Information" (form-1) and a 12-page "RHC New Patient Packet" (form-2) containing a variant authorization form on page 2. Neither document is a dedicated patient access request form; both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was exceptionally difficult. The hospital's website (cottagehospital.org) is protected by Cloudflare Turnstile, which blocked all automated access — curl, browser with DevTools, and even Google's cache were inaccessible. The forms were ultimately recovered only through the Wayback Machine using archived snapshots from July 2024. Notably, the current versions of both documents (updated in 2024) were not captured by the Wayback Machine, meaning only older versions could be evaluated. A dedicated HIM department page exists on the site but could not be verified due to the access barrier. The form was linked from a "Becoming a Rowe Health Center Patient" page — framing the authorization as part of new-patient onboarding rather than a standalone records-request process.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Cottage Hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access form. Both retrieved documents are generic HIPAA authorization forms. Form-1's operative language — "authorize Cottage Hospital to use or disclose my protected health information to [other entity]" — is oriented entirely toward third-party release, with no clear mechanism for a patient to request records for themselves.

Form-2's page-2 authorization makes a meaningful improvement: it distinguishes "Self or Representative" from "Other Provider or Facility" as separate recipient categories, with different scope rules for each. Copies to patients default to "Complete copy of medical record, excluding psychotherapy notes," while third-party copies offer more granular selection. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot, showing intentional thought about different use cases. However, this better version is buried on page 2 of a 12-page new patient packet, which a patient searching for a records release form would have no reason to download based on the filename alone.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form has interactive/fillable fields despite both being digitally created in Microsoft Word. Patients must print and complete them by hand. Form-1 is a single page with approximately 12 fields — a manageable scope. The layout follows a logical flow (identification → recipient → record types → legal disclosures → signature), but lacks section headers or visual separators. Legal disclosures run as a continuous block of dense text with sentences exceeding 50 words. The form uses 5 fonts for a single page, and its footer reads "PAGE 14 OF 28" — a vestige of the larger policy document it was extracted from, which is confusing.

Both forms include confusing remuneration fields ("direct or indirect remuneration in the form of [describe]") that are required by HIPAA only for sale-of-PHI authorizations but will mystify patients making routine requests.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the complete absence of submission instructions on either form. No mailing address (beyond the hospital header), no fax number, no email, no mention of the HIM department as a submission point. A patient who completes the form has no guidance on how to deliver it. The witness signature line, while not explicitly marked as required, may lead patients to believe a witness is needed — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, and no response time is stated.

## Notable Strengths

The non-conditioning statement ("I MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION FORM") is prominently displayed in caps. Psychotherapy notes are properly segregated per 45 CFR § 164.508(b)(3)(ii). The 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure warning for substance abuse records is correctly included. Form-2's welcome letter is genuinely warm and accessible, and its billing section proactively discloses a 44% community health discount for self-pay patients.

## Red Flags

Form-2's General Consent for Treatment (Section 11) contains a blanket authorization allowing Cottage Hospital to disclose records "at its discretion" to any party liable for hospital charges, explicitly including substance abuse, psychiatric, and HIV records. This extremely broad authorization is bundled into routine intake paperwork, raising informed-consent concerns.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Hospital provides a minimally functional records release process that requires significant patient initiative to navigate. The Cloudflare-protected website, non-fillable forms, absence of submission instructions, and generic third-party framing create a cumulative experience that falls short of patient-centered design. The partial self-access accommodation in form-2 and proper HIPAA compliance language prevent the assessment from being worse, but this is a facility where requesting your own records would require calling the hospital for basic instructions.

# Broward Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Broward Health, a government-owned regional health system in Fort Lauderdale, FL, offers a single general-purpose ROI authorization form ("Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Information") in four languages: English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese. The organization also provides an online records request wizard via Swellbox, a third-party vendor. The system operates multiple facilities (Medical Center, North, Coral Springs, Imperial Point, East Imaging Center, Weston), all sharing the same form and process.

## Access Pathway

Broward Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ROI form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both purposes, with a "MYSELF" checkbox alongside an "OTHER" option for third-party recipients. While this checkbox makes it possible for patients to request their own records, the form was not designed around the patient access use case — it requires a purpose statement (not required under HIPAA § 164.524 for patient access), applies minimum necessary language to all requests (which should not apply to individual access under 45 CFR § 164.502(b)(2)(v)), and includes a witness signature line that creates unnecessary procedural friction.

The Swellbox online wizard at `swellbox.com/broward-health-wizard.html` offers a potentially better digital pathway, though the PDF form appears to be the primary resource offered on the Medical Records Request page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The Medical Records Request page is reachable in approximately 3 clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Information Request → Medical Records Request) and is well-organized, listing all four language versions with direct download links plus the Swellbox option. However, **Cloudflare bot protection** blocked all direct `curl` download attempts, requiring browser-based retrieval. The English form URL was also case-sensitive, with the lowercase variant linked on the page failing — a subtle but real broken link.

## Form Document Quality

The form quality is a mixed picture. On the positive side, the form is a concise single page with a logical section flow: sensitive record classification, patient demographics, authorization and recipient designation, delivery method, purpose, date range, detailed record type checklist (~15 categories with date ranges for lab and radiology), patient rights disclosures, and signatures.

On the negative side, the **English version (form-1.pdf) is an image-only scan** — a grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no screen reader accessibility. This is the primary language version yet the worst quality artifact. The Spanish, Creole, and Portuguese versions are digitally created PDFs with text layers, but they too have **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The Spanish and Portuguese versions also have garbled text from font encoding errors in their expiration clauses. The form's footer references "ADDRESSOGRAPH" and carbon-copy routing ("WHITE - MEDICAL RECORD / CANARY - PATIENTS"), confirming its origin as a physical paper form from 2014 that has never been modernized.

Delivery options are limited to paper or **encrypted CD** — an anachronistic option in 2026 with no email, portal, or electronic transfer available through the form itself.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form includes a **witness signature line**, which is not required by HIPAA for patient access requests and could prevent patients from completing the form at home. A Broward Health authorized signature line is also present, suggesting the form may have been designed for in-person processing. No notarization is required. Fees are referenced vaguely ("reasonable charge" per CFR 164.524) without specific amounts. The website notes approximately 3 business days for processing. Fax submission is available at facility-specific numbers, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Exceptional multilingual support**: Offering the ROI form in four languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese) reflects genuine attention to South Florida's linguistic diversity and is rare among U.S. healthcare organizations.
- **Swellbox online portal**: Provides a fully digital alternative pathway for patients who cannot or prefer not to use the PDF.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 citation**: References the HIPAA Right of Access regulation directly in patient rights disclosures.
- **Granular record type selection**: The detailed checklist with date-range filtering gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.

## Overall Assessment

Broward Health demonstrates genuine effort in accessibility through multilingual forms and an online portal alternative, but the underlying form infrastructure is outdated and not patient-access-oriented. The 2014-era generic ROI authorization, image-only English scan, lack of fillable fields, witness requirement, and inappropriate application of minimum necessary language to patient requests all reflect an organization that has not modernized its records request process to match the spirit of HIPAA's individual access rights. The Swellbox portal partially redeems the experience, but the PDF pathway — which remains prominently offered — falls short of modern standards. **Grade: C.**

# Southeast Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Southeast Medical Group (SEMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Alpharetta, Georgia. SEMG does not publish its own standalone Release of Information form. Instead, it outsources the entire records-request process to **MediCopy**, a third-party health information management vendor. Four documents were retrieved during the evaluation: two versions of MediCopy's generic ROI authorization form (2023 and 2020), an SEMG patient portal proxy authorization form, and SEMG's multi-page patient registration packet. Only the MediCopy authorization forms are relevant to a patient requesting their own records.

## Pathways Available

The patient journey for requesting records begins at SEMG's website. The Resources section includes a "Medical Records" area with a "Request Records" link, which redirects through `semg.link/med-records` to **medicopy.net/patients** — a third-party site with no SEMG branding. From there, patients can either download a PDF authorization form or use MediCopy's HelloSign-based online authorization wizard. SEMG's FAQ also provides an email address (medicalrecords@southeastmedicalgroup.com) as a contact point for records requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SEMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The MediCopy authorization form is a generic instrument that treats every request identically — whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney is requesting them. "Personal Use" is listed among five purpose-of-disclosure options, but there is no separate pathway, form, or instructions for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The form asks patients to fill in both a source facility and a recipient, requiring a self-requesting patient to effectively provide their own contact information twice. No mention is made of patient-specific rights, fee limits, or the distinct legal framework that applies to individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. Direct searches for SEMG-specific ROI forms on the SEMG website and via Google yielded nothing — the forms page lists 10 patient forms but no ROI authorization. The FAQ answer for "How can I get a copy of my medical record?" is helpful, providing a direct link to MediCopy and an email address. However, a patient who bypasses the FAQ and navigates to the forms page would find no relevant document. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during retrieval. The redirect chain to a third-party site introduces an element of confusion — a patient clicking "Request Records" lands on a MediCopy page with no mention of SEMG.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (MediCopy 2023 authorization, form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. Despite being digitally authored, it has **zero fillable form fields** — patients must print and handwrite all information. The layout is well-organized, following a logical top-down flow: source facility → patient demographics → recipient → record types → purpose → delivery method → signature. Section headers use plain, conversational language ("Tell us about the patient," "How would you like the records sent?"), which is notably more approachable than typical ROI forms. The authorization paragraph is a single block of standard legal text covering validity, revocation, re-disclosure, and no-conditioning — dense but not unreasonably so.

The form offers good granularity for record-type selection (11 options including date ranges and "Other") and an opt-out exclusion model for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/STDs, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postal mail.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and creates unnecessary identity theft risk. **No submission instructions**: The form itself contains no address, fax number, email, or portal link for returning the completed authorization — a patient who downloads the PDF in isolation has no way to know where to send it. **Fee opacity**: The form notes "additional fee applies" for postal delivery but provides no dollar amounts for any delivery method. More concerning, SEMG's registration packet (form-4) discloses an Administrative Service Fee structure of $10–$150 per form, with "immunization records" listed as an example — this broad language could encompass patient access requests and would likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based fee limits.

## Notable Strengths

The plain-language section headers and sensitive-record exclusion options are genuine bright spots in form design. MediCopy's availability of an online HelloSign authorization provides a fully digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF. The FAQ's direct answer about records requests, including both a link and an email address, is more helpful than many practices' web presences. SEMG's registration form also includes modern patient-centered fields for preferred language and pronouns.

## Overall Assessment

SEMG provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records requests. The outsourcing to MediCopy means patients interact with a generic vendor form that was not designed around patient self-access. The form's content design is above average thanks to plain language and logical organization, but technical limitations (non-fillable PDF, missing submission instructions) and compliance gaps (SSN collection, fee ambiguity) weigh it down. The organization earns a middling assessment: records are obtainable, but the process was clearly not designed with the individual patient in mind.

# Owensboro Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Owensboro Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Owensboro, Kentucky, operating three hospitals (Regional Hospital, Muhlenberg Community Hospital, and Twin Lakes Medical Center) plus a medical group. The organization provides a single, system-wide "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Health Information" form (form-1) accompanied by a dedicated plain-language instruction sheet (form-2). Both documents are easily accessible online.

## Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved, both directly downloadable PDFs:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary ROI authorization form (2 pages). This is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Patients check "Me" as recipient and "Patient Request" as purpose to request their own records.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A companion instruction document (2 pages) explaining each section of the form in plain language, with submission addresses, fax numbers, and an email address.

Submission options include mail, fax, and email (himroi@owensborohealth.org for the main hospital), providing adequate electronic submission pathways. MyChart is also referenced as both a format and delivery option, indicating a patient portal pathway exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Owensboro Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves all purposes — patient requests, legal/attorney, insurance, and third-party release. However, the form does clearly accommodate patient self-access: "Me" is a prominently positioned recipient checkbox, "Patient Request" is a reason option, and the instruction document is written from the patient's perspective ("If you are wanting to receive your records check the box labeled 'Me'"). The dual-purpose design means patients must navigate fields intended for third-party release (recipient address, legal representative sections) and understand which parts apply to them, but the instruction sheet mitigates this confusion substantially.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. A simple web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's medical records page also surfaces both documents. No login walls, bot blocking, or CAPTCHAs were encountered. This earns a top findability score.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form has a proper text layer but **zero fillable fields** — all data entry areas are underscored blank lines and non-interactive checkboxes. This is a print-and-fill document. A patient must print, handwrite, and then fax, mail, or email a scan. The layout is logically organized across 2 pages with clear section headers and a reasonable field count (~15-18 fields). Language is a mix of plain English and necessary legal terminology; the companion instruction document compensates by restating everything in plain language.

The form offers an unusually comprehensive set of format options (Paper, MyChart, EHI Export, Email, Fax, CD, USB) and delivery methods (Mail, Pickup, Fax, MyChart, encrypted email, unencrypted email with risk warning). The explicit inclusion of **EHI Export** with a detailed explanation — covering all ePHI across the organization and named Community Connect Partners, delivered in TSV format — is rare and exemplary.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Multiple submission channels (mail, fax, email) are available. No fees are mentioned on the form or instructions, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs but not actively deterred. The 120-day authorization expiration is appropriate for third-party releases but is technically unnecessary for patient self-access under HIPAA § 164.524, which grants an ongoing right. The "Your Rights" section covers voluntariness, right to revoke, right to inspect, and re-disclosure risk — a solid rights statement.

## Notable Strengths

- **EHI Export option**: Explicitly offered with named partner organizations and format details — well ahead of industry norms.
- **Companion instruction document**: A dedicated 2-page plain-language guide is an uncommon and patient-friendly practice.
- **Comprehensive delivery options**: Seven format choices and six delivery methods, including encrypted/unencrypted email with clear risk disclosure.
- **Help phone number**: The instruction document closes with a direct number for assistance.

## Weaknesses

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields despite having a digital text layer — a missed opportunity for a fully digital workflow.
- **No pathway differentiation**: Patient self-access is routed through the same authorization form as third-party releases.
- **No fee transparency**: Neither document mentions whether fees apply to patient access requests.
- **120-day expiration**: Applied broadly, including to patient self-access requests where it is legally unnecessary.

## Overall Assessment

Owensboro Health demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its comprehensive format/delivery options, EHI Export transparency, and companion instruction document. The main limitations are the non-fillable PDF format and the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization. For a community hospital system, this is a well-above-average effort that could reach excellence with fillable form fields and a patient-specific access process.

# Olmsted Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Olmsted Medical Center (OMC) is an independent nonprofit physician practice in Rochester, MN. Two forms were found on the organization's website: a primary "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (form-1) and a companion "Authorization for Allowing Verbal Communication of Protected Health Information" (form-2). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records; form-2 is limited to authorizing verbal discussions with a designated person and explicitly disclaims any written record release.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

OMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. The primary form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, employers, and others. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this generic form: they fill in OMC's address in the "Release Information From" field (pre-populated) and put their own name and address in the "Release Information To" field. The form includes a "Personal" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which at least provides a recognizable option, but there is no guidance text explaining how a patient should complete the form for self-access specifically. The form does not differentiate between individual access rights under § 164.524 and third-party authorization under § 164.508.

That said, the form does reference "CRF 164.524" (a typo for CFR) and includes a strong non-conditioning statement — both patient-protective elements that go beyond what many generic authorization forms include.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. OMC hosts a dedicated "Manage Your Health Information" page accessible through clear website navigation (Patients & Visitors > Your Care & Visit > Manage Your Health Information). Multiple search strategies — filetype:pdf queries, site-scoped searches, and direct navigation — all led to the form quickly. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot blocking, which prevented programmatic downloads via curl but would not affect a patient using a browser. The page also lists Spanish and Somali translations, MyChart proxy access forms, and the verbal communication authorization form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **62 interactive form fields** — a truly digital-first design, not a scan or print-only document. The layout uses a clean left-column label / right-column field structure with clearly delineated sections: patient demographics, release from/to, method of disclosure, date range, record type selection (a granular checkbox grid), reason for release, authorization/expiration, revocation rights, and signature. The language is mostly plain and functional, though the opening line — "This is a legal document" — may intimidate some patients. The authorization section includes standard but dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation.

Delivery options include mail, pick up, fax (marked "Urgent Only — limitations may apply"), and patient portal (also with "limitations may apply"). The inclusion of patient portal delivery is a positive signal, though the unexplained "limitations" qualifiers create uncertainty. Submission methods include any OMC location, postal mail, or fax (507.287.2777), with a phone number for questions. Fax availability means a patient can submit without visiting in person or relying on postal mail.

## Barriers and Compliance

OMC imposes no unusual barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no upfront fee disclosure. The one-year default authorization expiration is standard. Revocation rights are clearly stated and require written notice to the Health Information Department. The form explicitly references the patient's right to inspect or receive copies under CFR 164.524 and states that OMC will not condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility on signing the authorization — a strong compliance posture.

Minor issues include two typos ("CRF" for "CFR" and "provide" for "provided"), an inconsistent mailing address between form-1 and form-2, and the unexplained "limitations may apply" qualifiers on fax and portal delivery. The "File Only — No Records Needed at this time" option in the delivery section is an internal administrative option that may confuse patients.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in English, Spanish, and Somali — the Somali translation is notably community-responsive for Rochester, MN
- **62 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive digital form, uncommon in healthcare ROI
- **Patient portal delivery option** alongside traditional methods
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference** and non-conditioning statement — unusually transparent about patient rights
- **Clean single-page design** that fits comprehensive content without feeling cramped

## Overall Assessment

Olmsted Medical Center delivers a technically strong, well-organized, and accessible ROI form that is easy to find and free of significant barriers. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must use a generic third-party authorization form and figure out how to adapt it for their own purposes. Despite this, the form's quality, fillability, multilingual support, and compliance posture make it a solid option for patients. The organization earns a **B** grade: strong document quality and accessibility, held back by the generic-form-for-all-purposes approach to patient access.

# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Anchorage, Alaska. Two documents were retrieved from its publicly accessible forms page: a primary ROI authorization form ("Advanced Authorization for Release of Information," Rev. 08/2025) and a standing PHI Disclosure Agreement (Rev. 8/4/23). Of these, form-1 is the relevant document for a patient requesting copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

ANHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary ROI form (form-1) is a dual-purpose generic HIPAA authorization covering both "obtain information from" an external source and "release information to" a third party. A patient wanting their own records must check "Release Information to" and fill in their own name and address as the recipient — functional, but not intuitive. The form's instructions frame it around sending records elsewhere, not around the patient's individual Right of Access. There is no separate, simplified pathway for patients who just want their own records.

That said, the form does include a notably strong patient-rights statement: it explicitly cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and tells patients they are "NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information." This is uncommon and commendable, partially compensating for the generic form structure.

The retrieval notes also mention a text-based ROI request option (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which could be a more accessible alternative channel, though its scope and workflow aren't detailed on the forms page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped search surfaced the ANHC forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms), which is well-organized with clear section headings including a "Request a Release of Information" section with direct PDF links. No bot blocking, captchas, or authentication barriers were encountered. The form was also available in Spanish, which is a notable accessibility feature for an FQHC. Difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally composed document — not a scan — with a clean text layer and reasonable file size (164 KB). However, despite being revised as recently as August 2025, it has **zero fillable PDF fields**. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and return it via fax or in person. This is a significant missed opportunity for a document that is clearly digitally designed.

The form collects approximately 15 fields: patient name, DOB, last four SSN digits, two phone numbers, full address, recipient information, record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization, date range, and signature. Requesting SSN digits is unnecessary for a records request and adds friction. The form fits everything on one page, which is efficient but dense. Layout is adequate with clear section divisions, though the volume of content compressed onto a single page limits whitespace.

Language is generally accessible. The introductory "PLEASE READ" paragraph is clear and plain-language. The legal disclosure section is denser but not impenetrable, covering authorization voluntariness, expiration, revocation rights, and redisclosure prohibitions. There is a typo ("heath care" instead of "health care") and a malformed HIPAA citation in the legal text.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Fees**: The form discloses that ANHC charges for copies, with an exception for facility-to-facility transfers. It does not clarify that patient self-access requests are subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee limits, which could discourage patients.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting the last four SSN digits is unnecessary and creates friction.
- **No notarization** required — positive.
- **Submission**: Fax (907-743-7255) is available as an electronic submission method. The form also lists the physical address. No email or portal submission option exists for the ROI form itself, though ANHC does use MyChart (referenced in form-2).
- **Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit HIPAA Right of Access citation** (45 CFR § 164.524) with clear patient-empowering language
- **Spanish-language version** of the ROI form available
- **Text-message alternative** for initiating ROI requests
- **Recently revised** (08/2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Adolescent privacy protections** on form-2 (MyChart proxy access controls for minors 12–17)

## Overall Assessment

ANHC presents a mixed picture. The forms are easy to find, the website is well-organized, and several bright spots — Spanish availability, text-message option, explicit HIPAA rights language — show genuine attention to patient access. However, the core pathway funnels patients through a generic third-party authorization form rather than offering a dedicated patient self-access route, the primary PDF has no fillable fields despite recent revision, and the fee language could discourage patients from exercising their rights. For an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations, the lack of a fillable digital form is a notable gap. The organization earns credit for accessibility features and rights transparency, but falls short on digital form quality and access pathway differentiation.

# Cherokee Health Systems (River Valley Health) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cherokee Health Systems, now rebranded as **River Valley Health**, is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The organization provides a well-organized suite of four PDF documents for medical records requests, available on a dedicated Medical Records page at rvh.org. The suite consists of the primary English ROI authorization form, a Spanish translation, and color-coded instructional guides in both languages — a standout accessibility feature that few organizations match.

## Forms and Pathways

All four documents are variants of a single general-purpose **"Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Health Records"** form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form distinct from the third-party release authorization. The form is bidirectional — it can be used to request records from an external provider or to authorize River Valley Health to send records elsewhere. A "Personal Use" checkbox is included among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Record Requested to be Sent From" and "Record to be Sent To" facility sections) assumes an inter-facility transfer model. A patient wanting a copy of their own records must awkwardly fit themselves into the "Record to be Sent To" facility section.

Submission is available via **email** (registration@rvh.org) or **in person**. No fax number for submission is listed on the forms or in the notes, though the form collects fax numbers for the sending/receiving facilities. The email pathway means patients can submit without a physical visit, which is a meaningful accessibility advantage.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which is also accessible via the main website navigation (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records). All four PDFs are prominently linked with clear labels and descriptive filenames. The only friction was Akamai CDN bot protection blocking direct programmatic downloads — a hosting infrastructure issue, not an intentional barrier. The page includes contextual submission instructions alongside the download links.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — despite being born-digital and recently updated (December 2025), the form was designed for print-and-handwrite completion. A patient must print, fill by hand, scan or photograph, and email the result. This is a meaningful accessibility gap for a 2025-era document.

The layout is logically organized with clear section headers: patient information, sending facility, receiving facility, record type checkboxes, purpose checkboxes, and a signature block. The upper portion is clean and self-explanatory. The lower portion contains two dense legal paragraphs — a sensitive information disclosure notice (appropriately citing 42 C.F.R. Part 2 and HIPAA) and a certification block that packs six signer categories into a single run-on sentence. The certification text is challenging for a typical patient to parse.

The **color-coded instructional guides** (forms 3 and 4) are a genuine bright spot. They overlay plain-language annotations explaining each section ("Enter your personal information in this section," "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider"), effectively translating bureaucratic form headers into understandable instructions. This paired approach — plain form plus annotated guide — is uncommon and genuinely helpful.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. There is no notarization or witness requirement, no mandatory in-person submission, and no fee disclosure (meaning no upfront fee barrier, though patients are also not informed of costs). The authorization expires after 12 months, and revocation rights are clearly stated.

The form does **not** reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), does not include a patient rights statement, and does not state a response timeframe. These are missed opportunities but not violations.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: The bilingual form suite with instructional companions is exceptional. Providing annotated guides in both English and Spanish demonstrates genuine commitment to patient comprehension and language accessibility — this goes well beyond the typical approach of offering a bare authorization form. The forms are recently updated (December 2025), indicating active maintenance. Email submission availability removes the in-person barrier.

**Weaknesses**: The absence of fillable fields in a born-digital 2025 PDF is a notable gap. The form's generic ROI authorization design does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a bidirectional facility-routing model when they simply want their own records. The Spanish version contains minor translation errors (CRF vs. CFR, missing closing parenthesis).

## Overall Assessment

Cherokee Health Systems earns a **B grade** overall. The organization clearly invested in patient communication — the bilingual instructional guides are a model other organizations should emulate. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the form wasn't designed with that use case front-of-mind.

# Synthesis: Duly Health and Care

## Overview

Duly Health and Care (Downers Grove, IL) is a large independent, for-profit physician practice formerly known as DuPage Medical Group. Four PDF documents were retrieved: one Duly-branded ROI authorization (form-1), two MediCopy vendor authorization forms (forms 2 and 4), and one specialized FMLA/disability intake form (form-3). The primary form for patient self-access is **form-1**, Duly's own "Authorization for Release of Health Information," processed by ScanSTAT Technologies and last updated June 2023.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Duly does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. All four forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any disclosure purpose. Form-1's "Purpose of Disclosure" section includes a "Personal Reasons" checkbox, and forms 2 and 4 offer "Personal Use," but none of these forms are specifically designed around the patient's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. The same witness requirements, fee language, and expiration terms apply regardless of whether the patient is requesting records for themselves or authorizing release to a third party.

The form header does note that records "may be available through MyDMGHealth" (the MyChart patient portal), suggesting a digital self-service alternative exists — but this is a brief aside, not a developed pathway. Delivery methods on form-1 include fax, mail, MyChart, secure e-delivery, and pick-up, which is above-average flexibility. Submission of the completed form can be done via fax (630-873-8797) or email (mrrequests@dupagemd.com), so a patient can submit without visiting the facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Duly's forms was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned direct PDF links on the first attempt. Duly hosts forms on Azure blob storage, and a dedicated medical records request page exists at `dulyhealthandcare.com/services/medical-records-requests`. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor friction: the coexistence of Duly-branded and MediCopy-branded forms could confuse a patient about which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF with a text layer and clean extraction, but **zero fillable fields**. It is a print-and-fill document. Despite being "Updated 062023," the form retains legacy branding — the email uses `@dupagemd.com`, the MyChart URL references `dupagemedicalgroup.com`, and the form ID starts with "DMG." The layout is organized into six clearly numbered sections with a logical flow (patient info → records requested → recipient → delivery → purpose → signature). Record-type checkboxes are granular (11 categories including imaging CDs), and date format examples are provided — helpful details many forms lack. However, the legal text in Section 6 is dense, presented as a continuous block in small type.

The MediCopy forms (2 and 4) use friendlier conversational headings ("Tell us about the patient," "Where are we sending the records?") but also lack fillable fields and have their own issues: form-2 has no submission contact information at all, while form-4 adds a witness requirement.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-1 requires a witness signature unless the request is for continuation/transfer of care or records go directly to the patient. A patient requesting records for "Personal Reasons" must find a witness — an unusual burden with no HIPAA basis. Form-4 imposes the same requirement.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "Charges may apply. Please contact us for details. Cash payments are not accepted." No fee schedule is provided, no amounts are indicated, and there is no acknowledgment that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests. The cash-payment prohibition is unexplained.

**"All records" rejection**: Form-1 explicitly states that "'All records' or incomplete dates are not considered specific." This may improperly limit patient access under HIPAA, which permits patients to request their entire designated record set.

**No notarization** is required — a positive. **Response time** is not stated.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple delivery methods** including MyChart, secure e-delivery, fax, mail, and pick-up — five options on form-1.
- **Granular record-type checkboxes** with 11 categories give patients specific control.
- **Explicit date format examples** reduce ambiguity.
- **Patient rights statements** in form-1's Section 6 cover revocation, right to inspect, right to refuse, and re-disclosure — comprehensive if dense.
- **Easy retrieval** — forms found quickly with no technical barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Duly Health and Care provides a functional but undifferentiated records request process. The primary form is well-organized and offers good delivery flexibility, but it funnels all requests — patient self-access and third-party releases alike — through a single generic authorization with unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, fee opacity, rejection of blanket record requests). The form is not fillable, retains outdated branding, and does not acknowledge the distinction between patient access rights and third-party authorization. A patient can complete the process (print, fill, fax), but the experience is not designed around their needs as a rights-holder under HIPAA.

# Community Health Center of Central Missouri — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Community Health Center of Central Missouri (CHCCMO), an independent nonprofit FQHC with four clinic locations across central Missouri, publishes a single general-purpose ROI form — an "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." Two versions were found: a current 2025 update (form-1) and a superseded 2023 version (form-2). Both are hosted as publicly accessible WordPress uploads on chccmo.org. There is no online portal, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no dedicated patient access form. The PDF form, submitted by fax, mail, email, or in-person pickup, is the only pathway.

## Access Pathway: No Individual Access Differentiation

CHCCMO does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party release. Both versions use a generic FROM/TO routing structure designed for provider-to-provider transfers. The 2025 form asks patients to specify "Please send my records FROM" and "Please send my records TO," with checkboxes for CHCCMO or "Other" at each end. A patient wanting their own records must navigate this structure, filling in their personal information in the TO field — a workflow clearly designed for transfers between entities, not for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). Neither form references HIPAA, the Right of Access, or patient access rights beyond a brief acknowledgment section.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **trivially easy**. A standard web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No site navigation, bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The filename (`Release-of-Records-updated-2025.pdf`) is descriptive. However, the older 2023 version remains publicly accessible at a different URL with no indication it is superseded, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The 2025 form (form-1) is the primary document and represents the organization's current offering. It is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite all entries. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → sender/receiver routing → delivery method → record types → date range → purpose → acknowledgment → signature. However, the page is densely packed, and the multi-column layout in the record type and purpose sections may fragment reading order. The acknowledgment section is a single dense paragraph of legal boilerplate rather than numbered, digestible points.

Positive document features include email as a delivery option (alongside fax, mail, and pickup), preset date range options ("Last 12 months" / "Last 24 months"), and a comprehensive list of 10 named record categories. The form is concise at one page. However, it contains a misspelled heading ("AKNOWLEDGEMENT") and inconsistent ZIP codes between the form body and footer (65101 vs. 65110).

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate. This creates a procedural barrier, particularly for patients completing the form at home. The sensitive records clause bundles all sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing) into a single all-or-nothing authorization without granular opt-in/opt-out, which may conflict with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records. The 2025 form does not mention fees, leaving the cost question ambiguous; the older 2023 version references potential copying costs. No notarization is required. Submission can be done via fax or email, so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: Extremely easy findability; concise one-page form; email as a delivery option (uncommon among ROI forms); preset date range options reduce friction; comprehensive record type selection; non-conditioning and revocation language included.

**Weaknesses**: No dedicated patient access pathway — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization form; no fillable PDF fields despite being digitally created; witness requirement adds unnecessary friction; sensitive records bundling; typos and address inconsistencies in the form; no HIPAA Right of Access language; no response time commitment in the 2025 version (the 2023 version mentions 30 days).

## Overall Assessment

CHCCMO makes its ROI form easy to find and keeps it concise, but the form itself reflects a provider-centric rather than patient-centric design philosophy. It treats all records requests — whether from patients, insurers, attorneys, or other providers — identically through a generic authorization form. The lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, and the absence of any Right of Access language mean that a patient requesting their own records faces unnecessary friction and receives no acknowledgment that this is a right, not a favor. The organization earns credit for easy findability and electronic submission options, but falls short on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and compliance hygiene.

# Phelps Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Memorial Health Center is a small independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Holdrege, Nebraska. The organization offers a single ROI form — a one-page "Request for Release of Information" — that serves as the sole documented pathway for patients requesting their medical records. No patient portal–based request option, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway

Phelps Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization used for all purposes — releasing records to another provider, to a third party, or to the patient themselves. "Patient" appears as one of three checkbox options under "Release Records To" (alongside "Provider/Hospital" and "Other Person"), and an in-person inspection option is included, but there is no dedicated workflow or separate form for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as an attorney or insurer, selecting the applicable checkboxes and ignoring fields meant for third-party recipients.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was **easy to find via web search** — a basic query for the organization name plus "medical records release form" returned a direct link to the PDF. However, the form is **not linked from the organization's patient forms page**, which only lists a Patient History Form and New Patient Form. A patient browsing the website through normal navigation would not discover the ROI form. The PDF is hosted at a raw Drupal file path with no landing page or contextual instructions.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but with zero interactive form fields. All blanks are underscored lines intended for handwriting. The form must be printed, filled out by hand, and returned via fax (two fax numbers are listed in the footer) or in person. No electronic fill-and-submit workflow exists.

**Layout and organization** are logical — the form flows top-to-bottom from patient identification through record source, recipient, purpose, record type selection, legal language, and signature. However, the single page is moderately cramped, and administrative fields ("Release completed by:", "MR #:") appear prominently at the top, potentially confusing patients who may think they need to fill them in.

**Language** is mixed: the top half uses plain, accessible phrasing with straightforward checkboxes, while the bottom half presents dense legal paragraphs covering HIPAA rights, revocation, treatment conditioning, and sensitive information disclosures. The legal text includes a factual error — citing "Health Information Portability and Accountability Act" instead of the correct "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no unreasonable barriers**: no notarization or witness required, no in-person-only submission (fax is available), and appropriate anti-conditioning language is included with a specific HIPAA citation (§ 164.508). Fee disclosure is transparent and reasonable — first 10 pages are free, $0.25/page thereafter, $10 for CD — which is more generous than many providers. The form also includes a "COMPLETE HEALTH RECORD" checkbox, simplifying requests for patients who want everything.

Concerns include the **calendar-year expiration** ("Release effective until the end of this year"), which creates an inconsistent authorization window depending on when the patient signs. The form is dated August 2017 and has not been updated in over eight years, raising questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **First 10 pages free**: Reduces cost burden for routine patient access requests.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Accomplishes a complete ROI authorization concisely.
- **"Complete Health Record" option**: Lets patients request everything without needing to select individual categories.
- **Anti-conditioning language**: Explicitly states treatment cannot be conditioned on signing.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields**: Entirely print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Not linked from website navigation**: Findable only via search engine.
- **Generic form for all purposes**: No differentiation for patient self-access.
- **HIPAA name error and outdated form**: Suggests lack of recent legal review.
- **Staff fields on patient-facing form**: "Release completed by" and "MR #" may confuse patients.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Memorial Health Center provides a functional but basic records request process. The single-page form is efficient and the fee structure is patient-friendly, but the lack of fillable fields, absence from website navigation, and failure to distinguish patient access from third-party release place this organization squarely in the middle tier. The form gets the job done but reflects a paper-era workflow that has not been updated to serve the modern patient experience. **Grade: C.**

# Community Health Centers of Burlington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Community Health Centers of Burlington (CHCB) provides two downloadable PDF forms for health information disclosure. **Form-1** ("Authorization to Send Health Information," revised November 2023) is the primary ROI form — a one-page, fillable PDF covering medical, mental health/psychiatric, and dental records. **Form-2** ("Authorization for Verbal Communication (Only)") is a companion form limited to verbal disclosures; it explicitly states "No paper records will be sent" and is not relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own records.

No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or web-based form wizard was identified. The primary pathway for a patient requesting records is to download form-1, complete it, and submit it — though submission instructions are notably absent from the form itself.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

CHCB does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization/disclosure form designed to serve all release purposes. However, it includes a "Patient copy" checkbox under "Reason for Release" alongside options like "Coordination of care," "Transfer care," and "Legal purposes." This checkbox normalizes patient self-access as a legitimate use case, even though the form's structure — with "Information REQUESTED FROM" and "Information RELEASED TO" blocks — is oriented toward third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate sender/recipient fields that don't map intuitively to a self-access request, creating potential confusion.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), nor does it include plain-language statements about patient rights to access their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required a site-scoped web search (`site:chcb.org`), which immediately returned a direct link to the PDF in a WordPress uploads directory. The organization's own forms page (`chcb.org/forms/`) did not render content — likely due to JavaScript rendering — meaning a patient navigating the website directly would have difficulty finding the form without resorting to a search engine. No bot-blocking or download difficulties were encountered. Findability is moderate: easily searchable but not prominently surfaced through the site's own navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-executed digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 36 interactive form fields, a clean text layer, and a modest 164 KB file size. The one-page design is impressively compact, covering three record categories (medical, mental health, dental) with date ranges, legal disclosures, and a revocation section. The layout is dense but readable, using bold headers, checkboxes, and horizontal rules to organize content.

Language is a mix of accessible plain English in the record-selection sections and standard legal boilerplate in the disclosure paragraph. The record type options are well-designed — patients can choose complete records or specify particular items, with date ranges available for medical and mental health categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

**No submission instructions.** The most significant gap is the absence of any guidance on how to submit the completed form. The header lists a fax number and email for receiving records *at* CHCB, but there is no explicit instruction for returning the completed authorization. A patient would likely have to call the office to ask. **No fees are mentioned** — neither disclosed nor waived. **No notarization** is required, and the form explicitly states that photocopies and facsimiles are valid, removing a common barrier. The conditioning-of-treatment language is legally accurate but could intimidate patients. A line about verbal communication, apparently carried over from the verbal-only companion form, creates minor confusion about what the form authorizes.

## Notable Strengths

- **"Patient copy" checkbox** explicitly normalizes patient self-access as a standard reason for release
- **One-page fillable PDF** with 36 interactive fields enables complete digital form-filling
- **Photocopy/facsimile acceptance** explicitly stated, removing an access barrier
- **Granular record selection** with date ranges gives patients control over scope
- **Revocation section** clearly states the right to revoke consent at any time

## Overall Assessment

CHCB provides a technically competent, concise authorization form that a patient *can* use to request their own records, but the experience is not designed around patient self-access. The generic disclosure framing, absence of submission instructions, lack of patient rights language, and sender/recipient confusion when used for self-access all point to a form built for provider-to-provider information exchange that accommodates patients as a secondary use case. The fillable design and compact layout are genuine strengths, but the missing submission pathway is a meaningful gap in the patient experience.

# Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph offers two versions of the same general-purpose ROI authorization form (Form #3014) linked from different pages of its website. Form-1 (dated 03/28/2019) is the current version, found on the Health Information Management page under "Authorizations and Forms." Form-2 (dated 11/24/2015) is an older version linked from the Privacy Policy > HIPAA Authorization Form page. Both are flat (non-fillable) PDFs. A third version in .docx format with entirely outdated "Heartland Health" branding was also discoverable via web search. The organization additionally uses Epic MyChart as a patient portal, though the ROI forms make no mention of it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mosaic Life Care does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both form versions are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request to Another Agency," framing the process as a release of records to a third party. A patient wanting their own records must fill in themselves as both the requesting party and the recipient. While "Personal" appears among 12 purpose options, there is no language, section, or streamlined flow that addresses HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) as a distinct use case. The form does not reference the Right of Access by name, does not explain associated timelines or fee limits, and does not mention the patient portal as an alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were relatively easy to find — 2–3 clicks from the homepage via the HIM page. Site-specific search also surfaced the relevant pages. The main complication is fragmentation: two versions of the same form (same form number) are published simultaneously on different pages with no indication of which supersedes the other. This creates a risk that patients encounter the outdated 2015 version, which still references the organization's former name ("Heartland Regional Medical Center") in its legal disclaimer.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) has a text layer and is not a scan, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore placeholders, requiring the patient to print and handwrite responses. The 2-page form follows a logical flow (demographics → source facility → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature) and uses a two-column layout that makes efficient use of space. The 13-category record type checklist with an "Other" option provides granular control over what is released. However, the language mixes plain and legal styles, with the deceased-patient section and legal disclaimers being notably dense. The form requires a purpose selection ("must select one"), which is not required under HIPAA for patient self-access requests.

## Barriers and Notable Issues

No notarization is required. Forms can be submitted via email (ROI@myMLC.com), fax, or mail — multiple electronic submission channels are available, and in-person delivery is not required. However, form-1 says nothing about fees, while the older form-2 vaguely mentions records "may be subject to copying fees" without specifying amounts or HIPAA fee limits. No response time commitment is stated. The mandatory purpose field is a potential compliance concern for patient self-access requests. An "Identification type / Verified by" line on the form could mislead patients into thinking in-person ID verification is required, though the form can be submitted remotely.

## Strengths

The standout bright spot is the 15-language assistance notice on page 2 of form-1, covering an unusually comprehensive set of languages including Pennsylvania Dutch and Trukese — reflecting attention to local community demographics. The granular record type selection and multiple submission channels (email, fax, mail) are also positive features.

## Overall Assessment

Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph provides a reasonably findable but fundamentally paper-oriented ROI process that funnels all requesters — including patients seeking their own records — through a generic third-party release authorization. The form quality is adequate with logical organization and good scope controls, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and missing fee/timeline information limit patient-centeredness. The organization earns a **C grade**, reflecting an acceptable but unremarkable approach to patient record access that meets minimum requirements without demonstrating meaningful investment in the patient self-access experience.

# Flowers Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Flowers Hospital in Dothan, Alabama, is a 235-bed for-profit community hospital owned by Triad of Alabama LLC and operating within the Community Health Systems (CHS) network. Three documents were retrieved: the hospital's official "Patient Request for Health Information" form (HIM-1406) in both English (form-2.pdf) and Spanish (form-3.pdf), plus an incidental release form from Wiregrass Surgical Associates, an affiliated practice housed at the hospital's Doctor's Center (form-1.pdf). The primary form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, the English HIM-1406.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated and Patient-Centered

Flowers Hospital provides a genuinely patient-centered access pathway. The official form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" — not "Authorization for Release" or "HIPAA Disclosure Form" — framing the interaction around the patient's own right of access. The form's recipient section lists "Myself" as the first option, with "Personal Representative" and "Other Third Party" as secondary choices. This clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release within a single, well-structured document.

Beyond the PDF, the hospital's medical records page offers an online request portal via Swellbox, providing a fully digital submission alternative. Between the fillable PDF (submittable via fax or mail) and the Swellbox portal, patients have multiple electronic submission options — no in-person visit or postal mail is required.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's website has a "Request Medical Records" page accessible from the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation. That page links directly to both the English and Spanish PDF forms and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative searching was needed. This is a model of how a hospital should surface its records request process.

## Form Document Quality

The HIM-1406 form is a single-page, digitally-designed PDF created in Adobe InDesign with 66 fillable AcroForm fields — an impressive level of interactivity for a one-page form. Every text input, checkbox, and selection area is digitally fillable, allowing patients to complete the entire form on-screen without printing.

The form follows a logical seven-section flow: patient demographics, facility identification, record type selection (13 checkboxes including "Entire Record"), sensitive information opt-in (5 categories covering substance abuse, HIV, genetics, and psychiatric records), delivery method, recipient designation, and signature block. The language is plain and accessible throughout. Five delivery methods are offered: paper, email (with appropriate risk disclosure), removable media (with password-protection option), mail, and in-person pickup. The removable media option with a password-protection toggle is an unusually thoughtful feature.

The Spanish version (HIM-1406S) is a complete, professional translation with identical structure and field count, linked co-equally alongside the English form — not a machine-generated afterthought.

## Barriers and Concerns

No significant barriers exist. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, and no excessive fee schedule. The form does include a witness signature field whose status as required or optional is ambiguous — this could deter patients completing the form at home. The fee disclosure is vague ("There may be charges associated with processing a request"), giving patients no way to estimate costs upfront. While not affirmatively problematic, greater fee transparency would better serve patients.

The form begins with an unexplained "*ROI*" header (internal jargon for "Release of Information") and the fillable fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader accessibility. The footer on the Spanish form remains in English — a minor inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

Flowers Hospital represents a strong example of patient-centered records access. The dedicated patient access form with "Myself" as the primary option, the comprehensive fillable PDF, the co-equal Spanish translation, the Swellbox portal alternative, and the easy findability from the main website all demonstrate genuine attention to the patient experience. The minor issues — ambiguous witness field, vague fee language, accessibility gaps — prevent a perfect score but do not materially impede a patient requesting their own records. This organization earns a grade of **A**.

# Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Penn Medicine (the parent system for HUP) provides two main pathways for patients seeking their medical records. The **primary pathway** for patient self-access is the **myPennMedicine patient portal**, which the organization's website explicitly directs patients toward. The **secondary pathway** is a downloadable PDF — the "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (form UPHS-099-9, revised December 2020) — a system-wide authorization form used across all Penn Medicine facilities.

Two versions of this PDF form were found: the current version (form-1.pdf) hosted on Penn Medicine's own infrastructure, and an outdated 2018 version (form-2.pdf) hosted on a third-party neurology practice website. The current form is the basis for this quality assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Penn Medicine **partially differentiates** patient self-access from third-party release — but only at the website level, not at the form level. The patient access web page directs patients wanting their own records to the myPennMedicine portal, reserving the PDF authorization form for broader disclosure purposes. However, the form itself is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that makes no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. A patient using the form must fill in their own name in the "I request my PHI to be released to" field, which is functional but not intuitive. The form includes one notable sentence acknowledging patient rights: "I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the authorization form required **moderate effort**. A web search surfaced the form from Penn's medical school subdomain (med.upenn.edu). The official Penn Medicine patient access page links to the same form but was initially blocked by **Incapsula bot protection** on programmatic fetches, requiring browser fallback. The form is not immediately discoverable from the Penn Medicine homepage — patients must navigate to Patient Resources → Patient Access Health Information.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a **strong digital artifact** with **70 fillable interactive fields** — covering patient demographics, facility checkboxes, 14 record-type selections, behavioral health/SUD opt-in, delivery method, and signature blocks. The ADA-accessible designation in the filename suggests intentional accessibility design. The layout is well-organized across two pages: page 1 contains the authorization itself, page 2 provides detailed instructions with submission addresses for six Penn Medicine hospitals.

Language quality is mixed: core instructions are clear, but the authorization section uses dense legal language about redisclosure and revocation. The behavioral health consent language is notably well-written and patient-respectful.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Submission method is the key barrier.** The PDF form must be physically mailed to the appropriate hospital's Medical Records Department — there is no fax submission (Penn Medicine explicitly restricts fax to urgent patient care situations), no email submission of the form, and no online submission pathway for the authorization itself. This makes the PDF pathway a predominantly paper-based process despite the excellent digital form.

**Fee transparency is weak.** The form states Penn Medicine "will charge for copying records in accordance with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware law" without specifying amounts. This references state law rather than HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient access, potentially resulting in overcharging. Radiology images are explicitly free.

**Ambulatory carve-out is buried.** The instruction that "Any Ambulatory/Office Visit requests should be addressed to the individual Physician's Office" is on page 2 and could cause patients to miss outpatient records.

## Notable Strengths

- **70 fillable PDF fields** — among the most thoroughly digitized forms encountered
- **ADA-accessible** PDF design with proper text encoding and interactive elements
- **Granular record selection** with 14 types plus behavioral health/SUD opt-in
- **Explicit patient rights language** acknowledging the right to inspect records directly
- **Free radiology images** — a patient-friendly policy
- **Clear compliance provisions**: 30/60-day response timelines, denial/appeal rights with Chief Privacy Officer contact, no notarization required, treatment not conditioned on signing

## Overall Assessment

Penn Medicine demonstrates institutional competence in form design — the fillable PDF is technically excellent and the instructions are thorough. However, the organization's approach to patient self-access is bifurcated: the portal handles self-access while the PDF form serves as a general-purpose disclosure authorization that doesn't optimize for individual access rights. The mail-only submission requirement for the PDF form is a meaningful barrier. A patient who cannot or does not use the portal faces a paper-based workflow despite the digitally fillable form. For a major academic medical center, the gap between the quality of the form document and the quality of the submission/delivery infrastructure is notable.

# DHR Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

DHR Health (formerly Doctors Hospital at Renaissance) in Edinburg, TX offers a single pathway for patients requesting their medical records: a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (DSR-GEN-71, dated August 2015), available in both English and Spanish from the Medical Records page. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no online portal, and no digital submission option beyond fax. The form is over a decade old, still carries the organization's former branding, and was designed for third-party release rather than individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF documents are available on the DHR Health website:

1. **form-1.pdf (English)** — A 2-page authorization form with a text layer and 37 unnamed fillable fields. This is the primary form for any records request.
2. **form-2.pdf (Spanish)** — An image-only scan of the same form, produced on a Konica Minolta copier. No text layer, no functional fillable fields, and several spelling/grammar errors in the Spanish text.

Both serve identical purposes: a bidirectional authorization that can route records either from or to the hospital. The form directs patients to choose between these two directions via an "OR" structure, with no guidance on which section applies to a patient requesting their own records. Submission is by fax or mail to the Health Information Management department; no online portal, email submission, or patient portal pathway was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DHR Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same form is used whether a patient wants copies of their own chart or an attorney is requesting records. There is no streamlined pathway, no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their own records. The form asks patients to state a "purpose" for the request — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access — without clarifying that this field is optional for patients requesting their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is **2 clicks from the homepage** (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and the download links are clearly labeled in English and Spanish. However, legacy URLs from a CMS migration return empty files, meaning patients following older search engine links will get broken downloads. The current URLs use CMS hash paths but have descriptive filenames.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) has a text layer and 37 fillable field annotations, but the fields lack programmatic names, limiting screen reader and auto-fill functionality. The form is not truly digital-first — it appears to be a designed layout with graphical elements, subsequently exported to PDF with fields added as an afterthought. The Spanish version is materially worse: a flat image-only scan with no text layer, no searchable text, and no assistive technology support, creating a two-tier accessibility gap.

The layout uses a cramped, checkbox-heavy design with multiple columns and 16 embedded images across 2 pages. The language is legalistic but not impenetrable, though the psychiatric/substance abuse/HIV consent section is a particularly dense compound sentence that would confuse most patients. The Do/Do Not consent mechanism via initials is ambiguous in its construction.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Social Security Number required** — The form requests a full SSN with no indication it is optional, creating identity theft risk for a document submitted by fax or mail.
- **Purpose field without exemption** — Patients are asked to justify their request, which HIPAA does not require for individual access.
- **Witness signature line** on the Spanish form adds an unnecessary step.
- **Liability waiver bundled** into the authorization on the Spanish form, asking patients to release the hospital from "all legal liability and any harm" from disclosure.
- **No fee disclosure** — The form says nothing about costs for copies.
- **No expiration clause** on the English form (the Spanish version defaults to 180 days).
- **No patient rights statement** — No reference to the right to access, right to revoke, or right to electronic format.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful in the Rio Grande Valley, where ~90% of the population is Hispanic/Latino. Offering a Spanish form, despite its quality issues, is a genuine accommodation.
- **Granular record type selection** — The ~20-item checkbox list gives patients meaningful control over what they're requesting.
- **Easy website navigation** — The form is prominently placed and easy to find via the main site navigation.

## Overall Assessment

DHR Health provides the bare minimum for patient records access: a downloadable PDF authorization form that is easy to find but poorly designed for patient self-access. The form is a decade-old generic release authorization that does not acknowledge individual access rights, requires unnecessary personal information (SSN), and bundles concerning liability language. The Spanish version's image-only format creates an equity gap. The organization would benefit from a modernized, patient-centered access form — or ideally an online request portal — that separates individual access from third-party release and removes unnecessary barriers.

# Troy Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Troy Regional Medical Center is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Troy, Alabama. The organization presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in the study: the only ROI form available is a decade-old, image-only scanned PDF hosted on a defunct legacy website, with no corresponding page or link on the hospital's current site.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page "Release of Information/PHI" authorization (form-1.pdf), dated February 2015. It is a general-purpose third-party release authorization—not a patient-access-specific form—though it does include a "Self" checkbox among the recipient options (alongside Physician, Attorney, and Other). No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

The form offers three delivery methods via checkbox: mail, fax, and in-person pickup. However, the form itself contains **no submission instructions**—no mailing address, fax number, email address, or department name. A patient who downloads and completes this form would have no idea where to send it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Troy Regional Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form is a generic HIPAA authorization that treats a patient requesting their own records identically to an attorney or physician requesting records on someone's behalf. The form's legal language—including a broad liability waiver and re-disclosure warnings—is oriented toward third-party release scenarios and is conceptually mismatched when a patient checks "Self."

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required exceptional effort. The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) has no medical records page, no HIM department listing, and no downloadable forms. The Patient Information page returned a 502 Bad Gateway error. The form was ultimately located only on the hospital's legacy FastHealth-hosted site (trmc.fasthealth.com), which is no longer linked from the current site. A real patient navigating the current website would almost certainly fail to find this form. Only archival web searching revealed it.

## Form Document Quality

The form is an image-only scan (grayscale JPEG at 200 DPI) with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers, cannot be searched or copied, and must be printed and filled entirely by hand. The scan quality introduces some blur, and the legal text is in small (approximately 9–10pt) type. It is served over unencrypted HTTP.

Despite the poor technical quality, the visual layout is reasonably organized. The title is clear, fields flow logically from demographics to record type selection to signatures, and the form fits on a single page. Record type granularity is adequate, with 10+ checkbox options plus an "Entire Record" option and date range fields.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Several significant barriers are present:

- **"All fields MUST be completed" warning**: The form states that any blank field renders the authorization invalid—an overreach beyond HIPAA's actual requirements that could deter patients who cannot provide every piece of information.
- **Broad liability waiver**: Patients must discharge the facility from "any and all liabilities" as a condition of signing—not a HIPAA requirement and inappropriate for patient self-access.
- **Witness signature required**: A witness signature line adds an unnecessary step with no legal basis under HIPAA for patient access requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no contact information for where to send the completed authorization.
- **Anti-conditioning language contradicts itself**: The form states treatment may not be conditioned on authorization, then immediately notes that "if conditioning is permitted, refusal to sign... may result in denial of care."

## Strengths

The only modest bright spot is the record type granularity—patients can select specific record types or request the entire record, with date range specification. The form also correctly references revocation rights.

## Overall Assessment

Troy Regional Medical Center's patient access experience is among the poorest possible. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, image-only scan quality, generic third-party framing, multiple compliance red flags, and a form that is over a decade old paints a picture of an organization that has not invested in patient access infrastructure. A patient attempting to request their own records online from this facility would face a near-impossible task.

# Colquitt Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Colquitt Regional Medical Center (Moultrie, GA) is an independent, government-owned community hospital. The organization offers a single downloadable PDF form for medical records requests, found on its Health Records & Patient Portal page. No online portal, patient portal integration, or alternative digital pathway was identified for requesting records.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was retrieved: an "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for releasing records to third parties. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a patient portal–based records request workflow. The sole pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — though the form itself provides no submission instructions (no fax number, mailing address, or email).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as an authorization for disclosure to a named recipient (item 5 asks for recipient "Name" and "Address"). While item 6 includes a "my personal records" purpose checkbox — a helpful nod toward self-access — the form does not explain what a patient should enter as the recipient when requesting their own records. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of patient access rights, and no separate pathway or instructions for patients who simply want their own medical records. A patient must navigate a form designed for third-party release and adapt it to their self-access needs.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped search quickly identified the Health Records & Patient Portal page, and the form was linked with a clearly labeled "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button — approximately two clicks from the homepage. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy**, and no bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page scanned image** with no meaningful text layer (only 11 characters of noise extracted) and zero fillable fields. It was created in 2021 using scanning software ("Transform Foundation Server"), confirming it is a digitized paper form rather than a digitally authored document. The form is completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology, cannot be filled digitally, and must be printed and completed by hand.

Despite the poor technical quality, the content design is adequate. The 10-item numbered list provides a logical flow: patient identification → who may disclose → record types → sensitive information acknowledgment → recipient → purpose → legal terms → signatures. Twelve record-type checkboxes offer useful granularity. The language mixes plain English with some legal phrasing — mostly readable but occasionally dense (e.g., the revocation paragraph). There are no section headers, boxes, or visual groupings to aid navigation, but the single-page length keeps complexity manageable.

## Barriers

- **No submission instructions**: The form contains no fax number, mailing address, email, or department name. A patient downloading the form has no guidance on how to return it. The website's Health Records page may provide this information, but it is absent from the form itself.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" line is present, which may lead patients to believe a witness is required — HIPAA does not require this for patient access requests.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form makes no mention of fees or costs for records.
- **No date range field**: Patients cannot specify a time period for the records they want.
- **No delivery format options**: No choices for electronic vs. paper delivery.

## Bright Spots

- **Easy findability**: The form was prominently linked from a clearly labeled page.
- **Voluntariness statement**: Item 10 explicitly states that signing is voluntary and will not affect treatment.
- **Patient-controlled expiration**: Item 8 lets the patient set their own authorization expiration date.
- **"My personal records" purpose checkbox**: While the form is generic, this option at least acknowledges that patients may be requesting their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Colquitt Regional Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request pathway. The form is easy to find, but it is a scanned image that cannot be filled digitally, lacks submission instructions, and does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The technical quality is poor — an image-only scan with no fillable fields and no accessibility support. A patient attempting to request their own records faces a form not designed for their use case, must print and handwrite their responses, and receives no guidance on how to submit the completed form. The organization earns credit for findability and a few patient-friendly touches (voluntariness statement, patient-controlled expiration), but the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# Columbia Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbia Memorial Hospital (CMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Astoria, Oregon. Two ROI forms were found: an English-language "Release of Information" form (HIPAA Form 3B, revised February 2025) and a Spanish translation (HIPAA Form 3Bsp, revised August 2017). Both are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms — the hospital does not offer a dedicated patient access request form distinct from third-party release authorization.

## Access Pathway

CMH funnels all record requests — whether from patients seeking their own records or third parties — through a single generic ROI authorization form. The form's "Purpose" checkboxes (Continuing Care, Insurance, Legal, Other) do not include "Personal use" or "Patient access," forcing a patient requesting their own records to select "Other" and write in a reason. The bidirectional design (Section C has both "Send Records To" and "Request Records From" fields) further signals that this form was designed for inter-facility transfers, not individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The hospital does offer a patient portal (myCMH) for partial record access, but the primary written pathway for requesting complete records is this generic ROI form. There is no evidence of a dedicated patient access request process that distinguishes individual rights from third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page at `columbiamemorial.org/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/` links directly to both the English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, browser fallback, or creative search strategies were needed — basic website navigation sufficed. The page also prominently states that "Records are free to patients who request their records," which is a notable positive signal adjacent to the form links.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a cleanly structured 2-page PDF with five labeled sections (A through E). Page 1 is the patient-facing authorization; page 2 is for hospital administrative use only. The layout is logical and navigable, with clear section headers and a well-organized record-type checklist offering 11 specific categories (Emergency Room, Lab Reports, Imaging, etc.) each with a date-of-service field.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). All data entry relies on printed blank lines, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity — the PDF was clearly created in a layout tool capable of adding interactive fields.

The language is generally plain and accessible. The opening purpose statement ("This form is an authorization to release protected health information") is clear and direct. The signature block language is standard without excessive legalese. There are no instructions or guidance text beyond the section labels, and no statement of patient rights beyond the required notice about entitlement to a copy of the signed authorization.

Submission methods are not explicitly stated on the form itself, though the header lists both a phone number and fax number. The page 2 hospital-use section tracks delivery via "Pt. Pick-Up," "Mailed," "Faxed," and "Electronic" — but these are staff-facing fields, not patient-facing options. A patient filling out the form independently would have to infer that faxing is acceptable.

## Barriers and Compliance

CMH demonstrates several positive practices: no notarization or witness requirement, no in-person mandate, and an explicit commitment to free records for patient access (stated on the website, though not on the form itself). Processing time is stated as 72–96 business hours.

The primary compliance concern is the absence of explicit expiration date/event language and revocation instructions in the form text — elements required by HIPAA § 164.508(c)(1)(v) for valid authorizations. Additionally, the form includes no reference to patient rights under HIPAA, no information about fees on the form itself, and no delivery format options for the patient.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Bilingual form availability (English and Spanish) is uncommon, especially for a small rural critical access hospital, and demonstrates attention to community language needs. The explicit "records are free" statement is exemplary transparency. The well-organized section structure makes the form more navigable than many single-block authorization forms.

**Red flags:** The Spanish form is nearly 8 years older than the English version (2017 vs. 2025), creating a risk that Spanish-speaking patients encounter outdated language or missing sections. Page 2 of the Spanish form is entirely untranslated. The form's missing expiration/revocation language may render signed authorizations technically non-compliant.

## Overall Assessment

Columbia Memorial Hospital provides a reasonably accessible, well-organized ROI process with commendable bilingual availability and fee transparency. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and gaps in compliance language prevent it from achieving the highest marks. A patient can get their records here without unreasonable barriers, but the process was not designed with the individual access use case as a priority.

# Garfield Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Garfield Medical Center (GMC), a for-profit community hospital in Monterey Park, CA, operated by AHMC Healthcare Inc., provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URL paths on the AHMC website. Neither form is specifically designed for patient self-access; both are general-purpose "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" documents that serve third-party release and personal use alike.

## Access Pathway

GMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient requesting their own records must use the same authorization form designed for release to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. The form includes "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox, and a patient could fill in their own name in the "Release To" field, but the framing is clearly oriented toward third-party disclosure ("I authorize Garfield Medical Center to Release Medical records to: Person/Organization"). There is no online portal, no digital request wizard, and no separate patient access request form.

That said, the form does include an "Inspect or Review Medical Record" option alongside copies, acknowledging the patient's right to review records in person — a positive touch that many facilities omit.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, login requirements, or browser workarounds needed. Both form versions were indexed and accessible via descriptive URLs. The only minor confusion is that two near-identical forms exist at different paths (`/gmc/documents/` and `/gmc/docs/`), both marked "Revised 9/21." A patient discovering both would have no clear way to determine which is authoritative.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — **not** a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand despite its digital origin. This is a significant missed opportunity: the form was clearly authored in a word processor but exported without interactive fields.

The layout is well-organized, following a logical flow: Patient Information → Release To → Purpose → Information to Be Released → Delivery Instructions → Notice of Rights → Term → Signature. Section headers are clear and distinct. The form offers impressive granularity in record type selection (12+ specific categories plus "ALL RECORDS") and provides multiple delivery options including email with a dedicated address field.

Language is generally accessible, using an "I understand that..." format for patient rights. However, legal references to California Health and Safety Code sections are included without plain-language explanation. The opening line — "Failure to provide all information may invalidate this authorization" — sets an intimidating tone, and it is unclear which fields are truly mandatory.

## Barriers & Concerns

- **CD liability waiver bundled into authorization:** All patients must waive liability for CD release as part of signing the form, even when not requesting imaging on CD. This is consent bundling.
- **Fees disclosed without amounts:** The form references California fee statutes but provides no specific costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate expenses.
- **Revocation limited to postal mail:** Revoking authorization requires a signed letter mailed to the Privacy Officer — no fax, email, or in-person option.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive absence.
- **Submission methods:** The form lists fax (626-307-2186), mail, email, pick-up, and hand delivery. Fax and email availability mean a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery option** with a dedicated field — uncommon among ROI forms.
- **"Inspect or Review" checkbox** alongside copies — acknowledges the HIPAA right to review.
- **Granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control.
- **Clear treatment non-conditionality statement** and 180-day expiration with patient override.

## Overall Assessment

Garfield Medical Center provides a reasonably well-structured authorization form that is easy to find and offers useful features like email delivery and record type granularity. However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form, lacking fillable fields, and bundling a CD liability waiver. The absence of a dedicated patient access pathway and the non-fillable PDF format are the most significant gaps. The facility meets the baseline for electronic submission (fax and email are available) but offers no modern digital workflow.

# CrescentCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CrescentCare is an independent nonprofit FQHC in New Orleans, Louisiana. The organization provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms — one in English (form-1.pdf) and one in Spanish (form-2.pdf) — for patients to request release of their medical information. Both are prominently linked from the Patient Resources and Downloads page. Notably, CrescentCare also maintains a dedicated "Request your medical records" page at `/records-request-form/` with an online submission option, providing a digital-first alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Assessment

CrescentCare uses a single generic HIPAA authorization form for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form is designed with patient self-access as a first-class use case: the "Myself via" option appears first in the recipient section, before the "Or to:" third-party option. This is a meaningful design choice that signals patient access is not an afterthought. The form offers three delivery methods for self-requests — Patient Portal, Encrypted Email, and Pick Up — with two of the three being electronic.

The organization goes further by offering a separate online records request page, giving patients who prefer a fully digital workflow an alternative to printing and mailing a PDF. This dual-pathway approach (PDF form plus online portal) is commendable for an FQHC.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding CrescentCare's forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's Patient Resources page prominently lists both language versions. No bot blocking, browser fallbacks, or creative search strategies were needed. The filenames are descriptive and language-tagged (`_en.pdf`, `_es.pdf`). Retrieval difficulty: Easy.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer. It follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient Information → Recipient → Information to Be Disclosed → Special Authorization for Sensitive Records → Purpose → Expiration → Patient Rights → Signature. The language is plain and accessible throughout; the patient rights section uses clear bullet points rather than dense legalese.

The form provides meaningful granularity with six record-type checkboxes plus an "Other" option, and appropriately gates sensitive records (behavioral health, substance use, HIV/AIDS) behind separate patient initials, consistent with Louisiana law and 42 CFR Part 2.

The primary weakness is that the PDF has zero fillable form fields despite being digitally authored. Patients must print, handwrite, and return the form — a notable gap for a document distributed online. Additionally, the form lacks submission instructions: no mailing address, fax number, or email address appears on the form itself, leaving patients uncertain how to return it.

## Barriers and Compliance

CrescentCare's form imposes no unnecessary barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement. The no-conditioning statement is explicit ("my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on my signing this authorization"). Revocation rights are clearly stated, though requiring a "signed letter" is a slightly higher bar than simply accepting any written request. No fees are mentioned on the form — this neither discourages patients nor sets expectations. No response timeframe is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Providing fully translated English and Spanish forms with identical structure is especially appropriate for New Orleans' diverse patient population.
- **Electronic delivery options**: Offering Patient Portal and Encrypted Email for self-requests is progressive — many organizations only offer mail or pickup.
- **Online records request page**: The dedicated `/records-request-form/` page provides a digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF workflow.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Fitting all necessary authorization elements on one well-organized page respects patient time.
- **Self-access prioritized**: Placing the "Myself via" option before third-party release on the form signals that patient access is a primary use case.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive form fields despite digital authoring — a missed opportunity for a form designed for online distribution.
- **No submission instructions**: The form gives patients no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **No fee or timeline disclosure**: Patients have no expectations about cost or turnaround time.

## Overall Assessment

CrescentCare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an FQHC. The combination of a well-designed bilingual authorization form, explicit patient self-access options, electronic delivery methods, and a separate online records request portal places it ahead of most peers. The main gaps — a non-fillable PDF and missing submission instructions — are common across the industry and prevent an excellent rating. Overall grade: B.

# Synthesis: Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin

## Overview

Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (GHC-SCW) is a nonprofit, independent physician practice in Madison, WI. It publishes two distinct ROI-related PDF forms, plus a Spanish-language version of one of them, on a well-organized public forms page. Critically, GHC-SCW is one of the relatively rare organizations that offers a **dedicated patient self-access form** separate from its general third-party authorization — a meaningful structural distinction that demonstrates thoughtful process design around patient rights.

## Forms and Pathways

**Form 1** ("Authorization to Release Protected Health Information From GHC-SCW") is a 2-page general HIPAA authorization form oriented toward third-party release. It covers scenarios like transferring care, insurance, disability determinations, and legal use, with "Personal Use" available as one checkbox option. A Spanish version is also published. While usable for patient self-access, the framing, language, and workflow are designed around the third-party release use case.

**Form 2** ("Patient Request for Health Information Form") is a 1-page, fillable PDF designed specifically for patients requesting their own records. This is the primary form for patient self-access and the basis for scoring. It uses plain-English question-based section headers ("What records do you want?", "How would you like your records delivered?"), offers granular record-type checkboxes with date range scoping, and provides multiple delivery options including paper, email (encrypted by default), CD, USB, and MyChart portal delivery.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

GHC-SCW clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release by maintaining two separate forms. Form 2 is purpose-built for the individual access use case, with simpler language, fewer fields, and a patient-centered workflow. This is a best practice that most organizations do not follow — the typical approach is a single generic authorization form that patients must navigate regardless of whether they're requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. The first web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's forms page at ghcscw.com/members/forms/ is cleanly organized with a "Release of Information Forms" section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA were encountered. One minor quirk: Form 2 was listed under "Health Insurance Forms" rather than "Release of Information Forms," which could cause a patient browsing specifically for ROI forms to miss the more patient-friendly option.

## Form Document Quality

Form 2 is technically excellent: a fully fillable PDF with 49 interactive fields on a single page. The layout is clean and logically ordered (demographics → record selection → delivery method → recipient → signature). The language is accessible and avoids legalese. The form explicitly references the patient's HIPAA right of access and sets a transparent processing timeline of 5 business days.

Form 1, by contrast, has zero fillable fields despite being digitally authored, and explicitly prohibits electronic signatures — creating a print-sign-scan workflow that undermines electronic submission. However, since Form 2 is the primary patient access pathway and is fully fillable, the organization's overall technical accessibility is strong.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: Form 2 states "There may be charges associated with processing a request" without specifying amounts. The notes mention CIOX Health as the ROI vendor and note that "CIOX requires payment for medical records." Fee vagueness leaves patients unable to anticipate costs, and the CIOX involvement raises questions about whether fees are limited to HIPAA's cost-based standard for patient access.

**Submission instructions gap**: Form 2 lacks any indication of where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email. Patients must refer to Form 1 or the website for submission details. Form 1 provides mail, fax (608-441-3499), email (ghcroi@ghcscw.com), and in-person drop-off as options.

**No notarization or witness required**. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a genuine best practice
- **Fully fillable PDF** with 49 interactive fields on one concise page
- **Multiple delivery formats**: paper, encrypted email, CD, USB, MyChart portal
- **Encrypted email as default** with opt-in for unencrypted — privacy by design
- **Spanish-language version** of Form 1 available
- **Plain-language, question-based headers** make the form approachable
- **Transparent processing timeline** (5 business days)

## Overall Assessment

GHC-SCW demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by maintaining a dedicated, well-designed patient access form that is technically fillable, concisely written, and offers flexible delivery options including portal-based delivery. The main weaknesses are the vague fee disclosure, the absence of submission instructions on Form 2 itself, and the use of CIOX Health as the ROI vendor (which may introduce fee concerns). Despite these gaps, the organization's approach to patient record access is meaningfully above average and reflects intentional design around patient rights.

# Fenway Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fenway Health, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Boston, MA, provides a cohesive three-document records-release package: an English ROI authorization form (form-1), a companion FAQ guide (form-2), and a Spanish translation of the ROI form (form-3). The forms are easy to find, submission channels are plentiful, and the organization demonstrates genuine care for its patient population through thoughtful design choices — but it does not offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway, instead routing all records requests through a generic third-party authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

The primary form is titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" and is structured around a FROM/TO model: "I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM: Sender/Facility's name... TO: Recipient/Facility's name." This framing is designed for provider-to-provider transfers — a patient wanting their own records must write their personal name and address into the "Recipient/Facility's name" field, which is unintuitive. There is no checkbox for "send records to me" and no separate patient access form. The organization does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization.

Fenway Health also offers MyChart patient portal access, which provides a separate digital pathway, but the downloadable form itself is firmly a generic authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Fenway Health's forms was straightforward — a simple web search immediately returned the PDF URL and the dedicated medical records page at fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was needed. The organization maintains a clean, dedicated medical records landing page with clear submission instructions. This is a best-case retrieval scenario.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a clean text layer and 7 fonts — clearly designed with care in a layout tool. However, it contains zero fillable fields, which is a significant missed opportunity. Despite being digitally created, patients must print, hand-fill, and then scan or fax the form. The layout follows a logical 7-section flow (patient info → sender → recipient → reason → record type → sensitive info → signature) and fits on one page, though the density is notable. The legal notice in Section 7 is a single 130-word block mixing authorization scope, revocation rights, reproductive health protections, and substance abuse protections — challenging to parse.

Section 6 (Sensitive Information) stands out: it requires individual patient initials for 10 categories of sensitive health information, including abortion care, gender-affirming care, HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, and substance use treatment. This granularity gives patients unusually fine-grained control over disclosure.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fenway Health imposes no unreasonable barriers. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person mandate, and no fees mentioned. Submission channels include mail, fax, email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org), and MyChart portal — four pathways, all adequate for remote submission. The form clearly states revocation rights and a one-year authorization validity period. Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (in the FAQ sheet), well within HIPAA's 30-day requirement. The sensitive information initials requirement, while thorough, could function as a processing delay trigger if patients skip it — the bold warning "COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING" has a somewhat coercive tone.

## Notable Strengths

Fenway Health's standout feature is the companion FAQ sheet (form-2) — a 3-page plain-language guide that walks patients through every section of the ROI form, defining terms like "bi-directional" and "abstract" that would otherwise be opaque. Very few healthcare organizations create separate instructional documents for their ROI forms. The Spanish-language form (form-3) demonstrates commitment to language access, though no Spanish FAQ exists. The inclusion of Massachusetts-specific shield-law language protecting reproductive health and gender-affirming care records reflects both legal compliance and organizational mission. The "Name used (if different)" field thoughtfully accommodates patients whose current name differs from their legal name.

## Weaknesses

The most significant weakness is the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway. The FROM/TO structure is designed for third-party release and does not clearly serve a patient requesting their own records. The lack of fillable fields on a born-digital PDF is a technical oversight that forces an unnecessary print-handwrite-scan workflow. The Spanish form's contact block reverts to English ("Mail/Fax to:", "Attn: Medical Records Dept"), undermining the translation effort.

## Overall Assessment

Fenway Health earns a solid B. The organization demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its FAQ guide, multilingual forms, and sensitive information protections, but falls short on the two key assessment dimensions: it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, and its form is not digitally fillable despite being born-digital. A patient can successfully request their records through this process, but the form was not designed with that use case as a first-class concern.

# A.O. Fox Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

A.O. Fox Hospital is a community hospital in Oneonta, NY, part of the Bassett Healthcare Network. It does not maintain its own medical records request form; instead, patients are directed to a single, network-wide "Authorization for Medical Record Release" (form H-6653) shared across all five Bassett facilities. This is the sole form available and serves as the primary pathway for any patient — whether requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Access Pathway

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of medical record release, not a dedicated patient access request form. However, it does meaningfully accommodate patient self-access: Section 2 includes a "Self, address listed above" checkbox, Section 7 offers "Patient Request" as a purpose option, and Section 4 defaults to electronic delivery via the MyBassett Portal when no format is specified. These features ensure a patient can navigate the form for self-access without excessive confusion, but the form's framing as an "Authorization for Medical Record Release" — rooted in 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization concepts rather than § 164.524 Right of Access — means patients are signing an authorization they don't technically need, and must navigate sections (verbal communication authorization, expiration dates, redisclosure warnings) that are largely irrelevant to self-access.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the pathway level. There is no separate patient access form, no distinct web page for individual record requests, and no portal-based request wizard. The single PDF form serves all purposes.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**, though not via A.O. Fox Hospital directly. A search for Fox-specific forms returned nothing; searching for the parent system — Bassett Healthcare Network — immediately surfaced a direct PDF link on bassett.org. A patient who knows Fox is part of Bassett would locate this quickly. One who searches only for "A.O. Fox Hospital medical records" might need an extra step. No bot blocking, broken links, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-constructed, digital-first fillable PDF** — one of the strongest technical implementations in the study. Key characteristics:

- **Fillable fields**: 83 AcroForm interactive fields across just 2 pages, covering every checkbox, text input, and signature area. This is unusually thorough.
- **Layout**: 10 clearly numbered sections with bold headings provide logical flow and easy scanning.
- **Delivery options**: Seven methods offered (MyBassett Portal, USB, CD, Fax, US Mail, in-person pickup at two locations, Email with encrypted/unencrypted options). The portal-first default is a progressive design choice.
- **Record type selection**: 13 categories plus "Entire Medical Record" and an open-ended "Other" field, with date range controls.
- **Sensitive records**: An opt-out model (Section 6) lets patients exclude categories they don't want disclosed, rather than requiring explicit opt-in for each — a patient-protective default.

**Weaknesses** are minor but notable: two typos ("Frist" for "First", "DISCLOUSRE" for "DISCLOSURE"), internal Windows file paths exposed in the revision line (`d:\forms\hosp\.ofm`), and dense legalese in the rights section — particularly the HIV/AIDS redisclosure paragraph, which is a single four-line sentence. The form does not mention fees or response times.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. The form requires only a patient signature — no notarization, no witness, no in-person submission requirement. The no-conditioning statement is clearly articulated. The one-year date range default ("If left blank, information from the past (1) year will be provided") could inadvertently limit scope for patients seeking older records, but this is a scope default rather than a true barrier.

## Bright Spots

- **Portal-first default delivery** is rare and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **83 fillable fields** on a 2-page form represents exceptional digital-first design.
- **Seven delivery format options** including encrypted email with explicit risk acknowledgment.
- **Opt-out model for sensitive records** defaults toward completeness.
- **No-conditioning language** explicitly protects patient rights.

## Overall Assessment

A.O. Fox Hospital, through its parent Bassett Healthcare Network, provides a technically excellent form that is easy to find and free of major barriers. The form's primary limitation is structural: it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual right of access — through a generic authorization framework designed for third-party release. While the form accommodates patient self-access well, it does not center it. A dedicated patient access pathway or a clearly separated section for self-access requests would elevate this from a good form to an exemplary one. Grade: **B**.

# WakeMed Health & Hospitals — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

WakeMed Health & Hospitals provides a single ROI authorization form ("Authorization to Release Medical Information," N-935, revised 11/25) available in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf, N-935S). These are the same form translated — not separate documents for different purposes. Both are linked from the Health Information Management (HIM) page under Patients and Visitors → Medical Records. There is no online portal, no web-based request wizard, and no dedicated patient-access form. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it by hand, and submitting via email (HIMROI@Wakemed.org), fax (919-350-1720), or mail.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

WakeMed does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization that covers both releasing and obtaining PHI. A patient requesting their own records selects "Personal" from a list of five purposes (Billing/Insurance, Patient Care, Personal, Legal, Other) and must fill in a "Recipient" field — a concept that doesn't map cleanly when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form asks for the name of the "Person, Organization, or Facility you want us to release your PHI to," which creates an awkward fit for a simple "send me my records" request. This is a generic_hipaa_auth pathway, not a patient-centric design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A web search for WakeMed's ROI authorization immediately surfaced the correct page. The only friction was that an older URL (/assets/documents/...) was stale and returned HTML, requiring navigation to the HIM page to locate the current PDF links under /sites/default/files/pdf/. Once there, both language versions are clearly labeled and downloadable without bot blocking or access restrictions. Difficulty: moderate — easy via search, but required one redirect.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. Checkboxes are rendered as the letter "o" in text, and blanks are underscores — a purely print-and-handwrite design. The form has a text layer (not an image scan), so the content is readable on screen, but a patient cannot complete it digitally without third-party annotation tools.

Layout and organization are strong points. The 2-page form flows logically: patient/recipient information → record types and date ranges → format and delivery preferences (page 1), then understanding/consent → authorization/signature → revocation → contact information (page 2). Section headers are bold and uppercase. Record type selection is granular, with specific options for office visits, hospital admissions, ED visits, imaging studies, and sub-components like discharge summaries and lab reports. The date-of-visit field is flexibly worded ("Specify the date, date range, or other specific description of your visit").

Language is reasonably plain, though the UNDERSTANDING section on page 2 leans toward legal formality with a series of "I understand..." statements. These are necessary disclosures (re-disclosure risk, revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment) but add density.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No unnecessary barriers**: No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission. Multiple electronic submission channels (email and fax). Identity verification is mentioned but framed permissively ("proof of my identity... may be requested").

**Fee disclosure is vague**: The form warns that "any and/or all" requests and large-volume requests are processed by WakeMed's copy service and "a fee will be charged," but provides no schedule, estimate, or reference to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based standard. A patient cannot predict costs before submitting.

**Notable bright spots**: (1) A Spanish-language version exists — uncommon in this study — though it has translation gaps, with key field labels ("Address where you want your PHI sent to," "Email address") remaining in English. (2) Six delivery methods are offered: mail, fax, pick up, onsite review, MyChart (for records after 2/1/2015), and email with encrypted delivery as the default. (3) Email submission of the form itself removes a significant access barrier. (4) The form was recently revised (11/25), suggesting active maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

WakeMed provides a competent, well-organized ROI form with multiple submission and delivery channels, a Spanish translation, and no major procedural barriers. Its primary weakness is the lack of a patient-centric access pathway — patients must navigate a generic authorization form designed for all disclosure purposes, and the non-fillable PDF format forces a print-and-handwrite workflow. The form is adequate for its purpose but falls short of best practice in digital accessibility and patient-centeredness. Grade: **B** (3.50).

# Intermountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) is a community hospital within the Intermountain Health system (formerly Intermountain Healthcare), a major nonprofit health system operating across Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming. The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones — all three retrieved documents are branded and published by Intermountain Health at the enterprise level.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all hosted on Intermountain Health's website:

1. **Form 1** (legacy, 2017): "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — a general-purpose third-party release form. Non-fillable, branded under the old "Intermountain Healthcare" name. Effectively superseded but still accessible online.
2. **Form 2** (06/2025): "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — a fillable third-party disclosure form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug explicitly reads `request-records-be-sent-to-someone-else`.
3. **Form 3** (06/2025): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a fillable patient self-access form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug reads `request-records-for-yourself`.

The most relevant form for a patient requesting their own records is **form 3**, which is the primary basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Intermountain Health stands out for explicitly separating patient self-access from third-party release into **two distinct forms**. Form 3 is titled "Patient Request for Health Information," uses question-based section headings ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?"), and defaults to "Self" as the first delivery recipient option. This is meaningfully different from the common pattern of funneling all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form. The footer acknowledges the patient's right of access under HIPAA.

One blemish: Form 2 (the third-party form) confusingly includes a "Patient Access Information" section with bullets about supervised in-person review and photo ID requirements, blurring the line between the two forms. However, the existence of a separate, cleaner patient-access form mitigates this.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF download links with no login, portal, or JavaScript rendering required. No bot blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on two domains — the legacy `intermountainhealthcare.org` and the current `prod.intermountainhealth.org` — which creates minor confusion but did not impede retrieval. The URL paths are descriptive and logical.

## Form Document Quality (Form 3)

Form 3 is a single-page, fully fillable PDF with 48 interactive fields, Print/Clear buttons, and a clean numbered 7-section layout. The language is plain and direct — section headings are phrased as questions, and the instruction "Please fill out all sections to avoid delay" is practical. Record types are covered by 12 checkboxes spanning clinical, imaging, billing, and substance use categories. Delivery options include paper mail, in-person pickup, and electronic (email, USB, CD, portal, other) with a free-text specification field. At ~2,030 characters of text, the form is admirably concise with no dense legal boilerplate.

Submission methods include email, fax, and mail — organized by state (UT/ID routes to Murray, CO/NV/MT/WY routes to Broomfield). Email submission is a genuine accessibility feature enabling fully digital completion and submission.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. Multiple remote submission options (email, fax, mail) are available — no in-person-only restriction. Fee language is vague: "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records" without specifying amounts, which could deter patients. The UT/ID email routes to R1 RCM (`MedRecReq@r1rcm.com`), a third-party vendor, without explanation on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-access form** separate from third-party authorization — uncommon and patient-centered
- **48 fillable fields** on a single page with Print/Clear buttons — excellent digital-first design
- **Question-based section headings** make the form feel conversational rather than bureaucratic
- **Email submission accepted** — a fully digital pathway from completion to submission
- **Electronic delivery explicitly offered** including email, USB, CD, portal, and "other"
- **Multilingual interpretation notices** on the legacy form (Chinese Traditional and Spanish)

## Overall Assessment

Intermountain Health provides one of the stronger patient access experiences in this study. The deliberate separation of patient self-access from third-party release, combined with a well-designed fillable form and multiple electronic submission channels, demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness. The form's plain language, logical structure, and concise single-page format make it accessible without assistance. Minor weaknesses — vague fee disclosure, undisclosed vendor routing, and a confusing legacy form still online — prevent a top-tier score but do not materially impede patient access.

# Southwell (Tift Regional Health System) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Southwell's medical release page at `mysouthwell.com/medical-release/` presents four downloadable documents. Two are parallel ROI authorization forms — one for the hospital system (form-1, "TRHS Authorization to Release/Obtain PHI," 2 pages) and one for the ambulatory clinics (form-3, "SWA Authorization to Release Protected Health Information," 1 page). Form-2 is a newer image-only scan (July 2025, produced on a Canon copier) that appears to be a revised version of form-1 but with degraded quality and no text layer. Form-4 is a reference list of ~40 TRHS entity names and addresses, not an ROI form. The organization also references Verisma as an online records request partner at a separate page (`mysouthwell.com/medical-record-request/`), but this pathway was not directly evaluated as part of the form download process.

The most relevant form for patient self-access at the hospital system is **form-1**, the TRHS authorization. It has a text layer, logical numbered structure, and covers the main hospital facilities. Form-3 serves the same role for ambulatory clinics.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Southwell does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All downloadable forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. They require the patient to name a recipient ("This information may be disclosed to and used by the following individual or organization") even when the patient is requesting records for personal use. "Personal Use" appears as one of six purpose checkboxes, but the form's architecture assumes a third-party release workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no simplified self-access flow. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, figuring out that they should write their own name in the "recipient" field.

The split between TRHS hospital forms and SWA ambulatory forms further fragments the experience. A patient who received care at both a hospital and a specialty clinic would need to complete two separate authorization forms for two different legal entities, with no clear guidance about which form covers which facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was relatively straightforward. The medical release page is accessible via the website's navigation (Home → Patient & Visitors → Medical Release), and web searches surfaced the page without difficulty. No bot blocking or login requirements were encountered. However, the page presents multiple forms without clear differentiation — patients must determine whether form-1, form-2, or form-3 applies to their situation, and the relationship between the overlapping TRHS forms (form-1 vs. form-2) is unclear.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 (the best available) has a text layer and logical numbered structure (8 sections covering facility selection, record types, sensitive info notice, recipient, purpose, revocation, non-conditioning, and voluntary disclosure). It offers good granularity in record type selection — 10 categories with individual date range fields, plus delivery options (Paper, CD, Electronic Delivery). However, the form has **zero fillable fields**. All checkboxes and text fields are static, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. The form does not specify how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, email address, or mailing instructions for submission appear on the form itself (the mailing address in Section 6 relates to revocation, not submission).

The language is moderately legalistic, with dense compliance-driven text in the sensitive information notice and revocation sections. The layout is functional but the second page contains only two short paragraphs and signature lines, suggesting it could be consolidated. Form-2 represents a regression — an image-only scan with no text layer, no OCR, degraded readability, and Paper pre-checked as the delivery method.

## Barriers

Two notable barriers exist. First, a **witness signature** is required on all forms — HIPAA does not require witnesses for authorization or access requests, and this creates a real obstacle for patients completing forms independently at home. Second, all forms collect the **last 4 digits of SSN**, an unnecessary data element that creates privacy risk beyond what MRN and DOB provide.

No fees are mentioned on any form. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated. The 90-day default expiration on forms 1 and 3 (extended to one year on form-2) could force resubmission if processing is slow.

## Overall Assessment

Southwell provides a minimally functional but decidedly paper-oriented records request process. The forms are findable and structurally organized, with useful features like granular record type selection and an electronic delivery option. However, the lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, the fragmented multi-form landscape, and the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway all reflect a process designed for institutional convenience rather than patient self-service. The organization appears to offer a Verisma online portal as an alternative, which could meaningfully improve the digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms remain firmly rooted in a print-and-mail paradigm.
