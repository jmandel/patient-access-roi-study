# Surprising Findings — Batch 5

## 1. The Form That Admits It's Unnecessary

Texas Oncology's authorization form contains a legally accurate statement that the form itself "is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual," citing 45 CFR §§ 164.502(a)(1)(i) and 164.524. In other words, the form tells patients — buried on page 2 in supplementary legal text — that they don't actually need to fill it out to get their own records. Yet patients must still navigate the entire 3-page, 95-field document because no alternative patient-access pathway exists. This is a striking case where an organization has the legal knowledge to distinguish patient access from third-party release but hasn't translated that knowledge into process design.

## 2. The FQHC That Hides Its Own Forms

El Rio Health in Tucson — an independent nonprofit FQHC serving a population likely to face transportation and scheduling barriers — publishes no ROI form online at all (grade: F, score 1.45). The compliance booklet references "full mutual releases of information" in its chronic pain policy, confirming the organization *has* internal ROI forms but has not made them publicly accessible. Patients are told to "Ask us how" to request records, requiring a phone call during business hours or an in-person visit just to learn the process. For an FQHC whose mission centers on underserved populations, this opacity is particularly jarring.

## 3. Prevea Health's Remarkable Multilingual Reach

Prevea Health, an independent nonprofit physician practice in Green Bay, Wisconsin, publishes its ROI form in four languages: English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. This is the only organization in this batch offering forms in Hmong and Somali — languages that reflect Green Bay's specific refugee resettlement demographics. Most organizations that offer multilingual forms stop at English and Spanish. Prevea's approach demonstrates that language access can be tailored to actual community needs rather than defaulted to the two most-spoken national languages. This stands out especially because Prevea scores only a C overall (3.4) — the multilingual effort wasn't part of a broader digital excellence strategy but rather a standalone commitment to linguistic access.

## 4. The Cooperative That Got It Right

Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (GHC-SCW) is the only organization in this batch that maintains a **dedicated patient self-access form** separate from its third-party authorization (grade: B, score 4.4 — the highest in the batch). Their "Patient Request for Health Information Form" uses plain-English question-based headers ("What records do you want?", "How would you like your records delivered?"), offers 49 fillable fields on a single page, and provides USB delivery as an option. What makes this surprising is GHC-SCW's organizational form: a member-owned nonprofit cooperative serving 70,000 members in Madison. The cooperative governance model — where patients are literal stakeholders — appears to produce measurably better patient-centered design. This raises a provocative structural question about whether ownership model predicts access quality.

## 5. Born-Digital but Paper-Minded

A counterintuitive pattern emerges: multiple organizations produce digitally authored PDFs with proper text layers, embedded fonts, and clean layouts — then ship them with zero fillable fields. Fenway Health, Grady Memorial Hospital, Cordova Community Medical Center, OrthoCarolina (revised as recently as April 2023), and Prevea Health all follow this pattern. These aren't scanned paper forms; they were designed in layout software by someone with PDF authoring tools. The deliberate omission of fillable fields in born-digital documents suggests an organizational assumption that forms will always be printed and handwritten — a design choice, not a technical limitation.

## 6. Liability Waivers Embedded in Records Requests

Both Grady Memorial Hospital and OrthoCarolina embed broad liability waivers in their ROI forms — patients must agree to release the organization from "any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure" as a condition of requesting records. Grady goes further with a completeness threat: "If any selection is incomplete, this form may be considered invalid." These provisions convert what should be a straightforward exercise of patient rights into a document where the patient assumes risk. For Grady — Atlanta's public safety-net hospital serving vulnerable populations — bundling a liability waiver with a records request is especially concerning.

## 7. Spanish Form Quality Gap

Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs offers bilingual forms appropriate for the Coachella Valley's demographics, but the Spanish translation contains at least 9 typographical errors ("APCIENTE" for PACIENTE, "cofidencialidad" for confidencialidad) and **omits the delivery method section entirely**. Spanish-speaking patients literally cannot indicate how they want to receive their records. This isn't a missing translation — it's a functionally inferior version that creates a two-tier service quality split along language lines.

## 8. Duly Health and Care Rejects "All Records" Requests

Duly Health and Care (formerly DuPage Medical Group) explicitly states that "'All records' or incomplete dates are not considered specific" — effectively rejecting blanket record requests. HIPAA permits patients to request their entire designated record set; Duly's policy may improperly narrow this right. Combined with a witness requirement for non-care-related requests and opaque fee language that prohibits cash payment without explanation, this for-profit physician practice imposes a constellation of small frictions that collectively discourage patient access without any single barrier being dramatic enough to trigger obvious compliance concerns.
