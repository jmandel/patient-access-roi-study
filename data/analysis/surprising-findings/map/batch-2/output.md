# Batch 2 — Surprising Findings

## The Capability-Choice Gap

The most striking pattern in this batch is organizations that demonstrably *can* produce modern digital forms but choose not to apply that capability to the document patients actually need. **JPS Health Network** (Fort Worth, TX; government, major system) is the starkest example: their 2025 HIE forms are fillable, text-searchable PDFs that accept encrypted email submission — yet their core ROI form remains a seven-year-old image scan with literally 1 character of extractable text. Similarly, **Mercy General Hospital** (Sacramento, CA; nonprofit, major system) produced a third-party authorization form with 42 fillable fields while both of its patient access forms have zero. The investment disparity reveals that patient self-access is treated as a secondary workflow even when the organization has the technical capacity to do better.

## East Georgia Healthcare Center: No Form Exists

**East Georgia Healthcare Center** (Swainsboro, GA; nonprofit FQHC) presents perhaps the most extreme finding: the only ROI forms on its website are designed for *incoming* records — authorizing other providers to send records *to* EGHC. A patient wanting records *from* EGHC has no applicable form anywhere online. The irony deepens because EGHC has invested in RightSignature (an e-signature platform) for these forms, demonstrating digital sophistication applied to the wrong problem entirely.

## Small Rural Hospitals Punching Above Their Weight

Several critical access hospitals defy the expectation that small, rural, under-resourced facilities would lag behind. **Myrtue Medical Center** (Harlan, IA; nonprofit independent CAH) offers MyChart portal delivery, encrypted email, Spanish translations, and substance-use carve-outs with proper 42 CFR Part 2 citations — features that many major urban systems lack. **Riverwood Healthcare Center** (Aitkin, MN; nonprofit independent CAH) supplements its PDF with a HIPAA-compliant JotForm online submission — a pragmatic digital solution that avoids the cost of enterprise portal vendors. **Columbia Memorial Hospital** (Astoria, OR; nonprofit independent CAH) explicitly states records are *free* for patients requesting their own — a transparency rare even among large systems. **Boone County Health Center** (Albion, NE; government independent CAH) maintains a dedicated ROI email address and offers encrypted email delivery. These small facilities are finding creative, low-cost ways to modernize.

## Physician Gatekeeping of Patient Access

**Mercy General Hospital's** patient access form includes a "NOTIFICATION TO DOCTOR" section that actively solicits physician objections to releasing records, without informing the patient of their right to appeal. Both Mercy General and its medical group form require physician approval before releasing HIV test results or psychiatric records *to the patient themselves* — a requirement that likely conflicts with HIPAA's Right of Access, which generally does not condition patient access on provider approval. This is the only instance in the batch of explicit physician veto mechanisms embedded in patient access forms.

## For-Profit System Surprises

**Merit Health Central** (Jackson, MS; for-profit, CHS subsidiary) defies the expectation that for-profit chains prioritize institutional efficiency over patient experience. Its form is titled "Patient Request for Health Information" with "Myself" as the first recipient option, offers five delivery methods including password-protected removable media, provides a Spanish translation with identical fillable fields, and earns the highest overall score (4.15) in the batch. Meanwhile, **ENT & Allergy Associates** (Tarrytown, NY; for-profit independent, 80+ offices) earns a 2.05 with an unfindable 2009 Word document — demonstrating that practice size does not predict quality.

## Progressive Sensitive-Information Categories

**Brattleboro Memorial Hospital** (VT; nonprofit independent) updated its form in January 2025 to include checkboxes for Reproductive Health Care and Gender Affirming Care — categories that reflect post-*Dobbs* privacy concerns and evolving care paradigms. This is unusually forward-thinking for a community hospital and suggests that even organizations with otherwise middling processes (C grade) may lead on specific dimensions. Separately, **Texas Oncology** includes a dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page current with 2024 federal reproductive health rules — the only form in the batch with this feature.

## The Opacity Trap: Portal-Only Without Transparency

**Minnie Hamilton Health System** (Grantsville, WV; nonprofit independent CAH) has gone fully digital via ChartRequest but in doing so created an opacity barrier: patients must create a third-party account before they can even *see* the authorization form, fee schedule, or process details. For a rural West Virginia population with limited internet access, this digital-first approach may be more exclusionary than a simple downloadable PDF. The organization publishes no paper alternative on its website.

## Government Hospitals: A Wide Spectrum

Government-owned facilities span the quality range more than any other ownership type in this batch. **Valleywise Health** (Phoenix, AZ; government independent) earns the only 5/5 patient-centeredness score with a dedicated bilingual patient access form. At the other extreme, **Natividad Medical Center** (Salinas, CA; government independent) offers only image-scan PDFs with CD as the sole electronic delivery method, and **UMC of Southern Nevada** (Las Vegas; government independent) doesn't link its ROI form from its own medical records page. Government ownership appears to be neither a predictor of quality nor a barrier — it simply removes the question from the equation.

## Recurring Oddity: Hendrick Health Misspells HIPAA

**Hendrick Health** (Abilene, TX; nonprofit regional) misspells "HIPAA" as "HIPPA" in the opening paragraph of both its hospital and clinic forms — a factual error on the very regulation the form implements. While a small detail, it appears in the first sentence patients read and undermines institutional credibility on the topic of health information privacy.
