# Boone County Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Boone County Health Center (BCHC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Albion, Nebraska. The organization provides a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests — there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway. Three documents were found: the current ROI form (form-2), a superseded 2017 version (form-1), and a HIPAA Contact Information form (form-3) that is explicitly not an ROI substitute.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The primary and only ROI form is form-2, "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information," uploaded in February 2026 as a Microsoft Word .docx file. This replaced an older PDF version (form-1, August 2017) that remains accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the website. The current form is a generic authorization that handles both outbound release ("Release Information To") and inbound record requests ("Obtain Records From") through a single check-one mechanism. While a "Patient Request" purpose checkbox exists, the form does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party authorization, and makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — basic web searches surfaced both the old and new versions, and the current form is listed on the Patient Forms section under Patient Resources > General Information. The main complication is that the current form is published only as a .docx file, which is unusual and less accessible than PDF. The website also requires JavaScript rendering to display form links. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page document with a logical flow: patient identification, release direction, purpose, date range, record types, sensitive information authorization, delivery format, legal acknowledgments, and signatures. It has zero fillable fields — all inputs are underscore blank lines, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The .docx format theoretically allows typing, but without proper form fields the experience is poor.

The layout is reasonably organized with clear sections, though the release direction framing ("Release Information To" vs. "Obtain Records From") is confusing for patients who simply want their own records. The sensitive information section has garbled instruction text from formatting issues. Language is generally plain and accessible, with concise legal acknowledgments. There are no instructions explaining how to submit the completed form, though the header provides phone, fax, and a dedicated ROI email address (Roi@boonecohealth.org).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is required. Fee disclosure is vague — the form states "copy fees may apply in accordance with Nebraska law" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access and third-party fees. A photo ID/witness requirement appears on the signature line but its scope is ambiguous — it may apply only to in-person pickup. The form includes a proper non-coercion statement, re-disclosure warning, 12-month fixed expiration, and revocation rights. No turnaround time is stated. A typo ("Heath" instead of "Health") appears in the legal section.

Submission methods include fax (402-395-2180), potentially email (Roi@boonecohealth.org is listed but not explicitly stated as a submission channel), mail, and in-person delivery. Fax availability means electronic submission is possible without visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

BCHC shows several bright spots unusual for a small critical access hospital: a dedicated ROI email address suggesting a staffed intake process, encrypted email as a delivery format option, and careful handling of sensitive information categories with separate initials required for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV/AIDS records per Nebraska law. The form is compact (2 pages) and avoids excessive legalese.

## Notable Weaknesses

The .docx-only publication format is a meaningful accessibility barrier. The lack of fillable fields means this is fundamentally a paper workflow. The generic authorization framing without any acknowledgment of patient access rights under HIPAA means a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for third-party release. The continued availability of the superseded 2017 form at its original URL creates confusion risk.

## Overall Assessment

Boone County Health Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is findable and the content is adequate, but it reflects a traditional paper-centric approach with no digital-first design or patient access differentiation. The bright spots — dedicated email, encrypted delivery, compact design — show genuine effort, but the .docx format, lack of fillable fields, and generic authorization framing hold back the overall experience. A patient can get the job done, but must figure out the process largely on their own.

# Black River Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Black River Memorial Hospital (Black River Falls, WI) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital operating under the "Black River Health" brand. The organization offers a single downloadable ROI form for patients requesting health records. There is no patient portal–based request pathway, no online submission wizard, and no dedicated patient access form — only a general-purpose "Release of Information Authorization" that serves all release scenarios.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one ROI-related form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page "Release of Information Authorization" linked from the Patient Resources page. The form covers both directions of information flow — releasing records from the organization and receiving records to it — and is designed primarily for facility-to-facility transfers. A patient requesting their own records must navigate this general-purpose form, selecting "Per Patient Request" as one of eight possible reasons for the release.

No online portal, email submission, or electronic request pathway exists. The form lists delivery format options for *receiving* records (Mailed, Faxed, Pick Up, CD) but provides **no instructions for how to submit the completed form** — no mailing address, fax number, or drop-off location. The only contact information on the form is the HIPAA Privacy & Security Officer phone number (715-284-5361). A patient would need to call to determine how to return the form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. It is linked from the Patient Resources page under a "Forms" section, labeled "Authorization to Disclose Information." A site-specific web search also surfaced the direct PDF URL immediately. The description on the website frames the form as being for sharing information "from other healthcare facilities or providers" — not explicitly for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Black River Memorial Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form funnels all requests through the same authorization workflow. While the form includes "Per Patient Request" as a reason option and page 2 contains a substantive patient rights section (right to receive a copy, refuse to sign, revoke, inspect, and prohibition of conditions), the form's structure assumes a third-party release scenario: Section 2 asks "who has the information" and Section 3 asks "where you want it sent." A patient requesting their own records must work within this framework, which isn't designed for them.

## Form Document Quality

The form has **severe technical accessibility problems**. Despite being created in Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 in 2025, the PDF renders virtually all text as images — 970 embedded images across 2 pages, with only 43 characters of extractable text. The form has zero fillable/interactive fields; patients must print and complete it by hand. This makes the form inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology.

On the positive side, the visual layout is well-organized with numbered sections and clear headers using question-like phrasing ("Why the information is needed," "How would you like this information"). The form is a reasonable 2 pages in length. However, Section 2 confusingly mixes source facility checkboxes with information-type checkboxes (Alcohol Treatment, HIV Results), and Section 5 imposes a default 2-year scope if the patient doesn't specify a date range.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. The form mentions a "reasonable fee may be associated" for inspecting or copying records but provides no specifics on amounts or HIPAA fee limitations. No response time commitment is stated. The prohibition of conditions language is explicitly included — the organization cannot condition treatment or benefits on signing the authorization. A photocopy clause ("as valid as the original") is a patient-friendly touch.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Easy findability, explicit prohibition of conditions, photocopy validity clause, patient-friendly expiration (remains in effect until processed), and direct HIPAA Privacy Officer contact information.

**Red flags:** The near-total text inaccessibility of a modern Word-generated PDF is a significant barrier, particularly for patients with disabilities. The complete absence of submission instructions means a patient who downloads the form online has no idea how to return it. The lack of any dedicated patient access pathway means every patient must navigate a form designed for third-party releases.

## Overall Assessment

Black River Memorial Hospital provides an easy-to-find form with reasonable content and good compliance language, but the technical execution is poor and the patient access experience is an afterthought. The image-rendered PDF and missing submission instructions create unnecessary friction for a patient trying to exercise their right of access. **Grade: C.**

# Yale New Haven Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH), a major teaching hospital in New Haven, CT, is part of the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS). For medical records requests, YNHH uses a system-wide fillable PDF form titled "Authorization for Access/Release of Information" (Form F4918Eng, dated 07/19). A second form exists for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, another YNHHS facility, but it is not the primary form for YNHH patients. The assessment below focuses on Form 1 as the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records from Yale New Haven Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient-Friendly Features

YNHH does not offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from its third-party release authorization. The single system-wide form serves both purposes. However, the form makes notable accommodations for patient self-access: the title includes the word "Access" (not just "Release"), "Personal use" is listed as the first purpose option, and the form supports bidirectional requests (both "RELEASE information TO" and "OBTAIN information FROM"). Despite these touches, the underlying structure is a generic HIPAA authorization. A patient requesting their own records must designate themselves as the "recipient" — an awkward fit that reveals the form's third-party-release DNA. The form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or frame the request as an exercise of the patient's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search immediately surfaced it on the YNHHS parent system website, which hosts a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page with direct PDF download links. No login, account creation, or bot-blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on ynhhs.org (parent system) rather than ynhh.org (hospital), which is logical but could cause mild confusion for patients starting at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

Form 1 is an impressive digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 97 interactive form fields — one of the highest counts in the study. Every data-entry point appears to have an interactive field, enabling patients to complete the form entirely on-screen before printing for signature. The two-page layout follows a logical flow: patient identity → purpose → recipient → delivery method → facility/visit selection → date range → record types → sensitive information exclusions → legal disclosures → submission instructions → signature. Sections are clearly delineated and the form is dense but functional.

The language is mostly clear in the data-entry sections but shifts to dense legal prose in the "I understand that" statements on page 2. The minor consent paragraph is particularly complex, with nested age thresholds under Connecticut state law. The sensitive information section uses an opt-out model (all sensitive records released unless the patient initials specific exclusions), which is patient-friendly in intent but uses double-negative framing that could confuse.

## Submission and Delivery

The form offers robust submission options: mail (PO Box 9565, New Haven), fax (203-688-4645), and three email addresses differentiated by entity (Hospital, NEMG, Yale Medicine). This flexibility is a genuine strength — patients can submit electronically without visiting the facility.

For delivery, five options are available: MyChart portal (requiring an active account), mail, fax, secure email, and pick-up. MyChart delivery is a standout feature that most ROI forms lack, offering an end-to-end electronic pathway for records receipt.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The authorization is valid for one year, and revocation rights are clearly explained. The voluntariness statement is explicit: treatment is not conditioned on signing.

The main compliance gap is ambiguous fee language. "Reasonable cost-based fees apply" appears next to radiology images, while "There may be a charge for copies in accordance with Connecticut law" appears in the legal section. Neither amount is disclosed, and the form does not clarify whether the HIPAA cost-based fee ceiling applies when a patient requests their own records. The turnaround commitment of 10 business days is explicit and well within HIPAA's 30-day limit.

## Notable Strengths

- **97 fillable fields** — exceptionally high digital-first form design
- **MyChart delivery** — electronic records receipt via patient portal
- **Multiple submission channels** — three email addresses, fax, and mail
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific categories plus complete record option
- **10-business-day turnaround commitment** with a customer service phone number

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as third-party requesters
- **Wet signature required** — breaks the digital workflow (fill → print → sign → scan → email)
- **Fee language is ambiguous** — does not distinguish patient-access fees from third-party fees
- **Form last updated July 2019** — nearly seven years old, may not reflect current policies
- **No multilingual versions found**

## Overall Assessment

Yale New Haven Hospital provides a competent, digitally mature records request experience that falls short of true patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF, multiple submission/delivery options, and MyChart integration demonstrate genuine investment in accessibility. However, the organization has not taken the step of creating a distinct patient access pathway — patients must navigate a dual-purpose authorization form designed primarily for third-party release. The result is a solid B-level experience: functional and mostly friction-free, but not designed around the patient's perspective.

# UW Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UW Medical Center, part of the UW Medicine system (University of Washington), provides a single ROI form for all of its facilities: "Patient Authorization to Disclose, Release, and/or Obtain Protected Health Information" (form U0626, version V.2512, last approved December 2025). This 3-page fillable PDF covers Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center (Montlake and Northwest campuses), UW Medicine Primary Care, and UW Physicians. No separate patient-access-specific form exists — this is a generic HIPAA authorization serving both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UW Medicine does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from third-party authorization. The single form handles all release scenarios — attorneys, providers, insurers, and patients alike. The "Purpose of Request" section includes a "Personal" checkbox, and the "Recipient of Records" field lists "Patient" as one example alongside "Insurance Company, Attorney, Physician." A patient can certainly use this form, but the framing treats self-access as one option among many rather than a first-class use case.

However, UW Medicine partially compensates with an outstanding **MyChart fast-track**: the form opens with a prominent callout — *"Recent medical records are available via MyChart for immediate download without filling out this form"* — and page 3 elaborates with instructions and a URL. The form also notes that an electronic request form is available within MyChart as an alternative. This effectively creates a two-tier system: MyChart for recent records (instant, self-service), and the paper authorization for everything else.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. Web searches for UW Medical Center ROI terms immediately surfaced it, and the UW Medicine website's Patient Forms page links directly to the canonical URL on the UW compliance site (`depts.washington.edu/comply/docs/103f7_AuthRq.pdf`). One complication: the uwmedicine.org CDN blocks programmatic downloads (403 errors), but since the official patient forms page links to the compliance-hosted version, patients following the normal path encounter no issues. No browser fallback was needed for the working URL.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-designed interactive PDF with **61 fillable fields**, a full text layer, and 10 embedded fonts — clearly a digital-first document, not a scan. The layout follows a logical **numbered structure** (Items #1–7): patient information, purpose, facility selection, recipient, record types, format preferences, and expiration. This is easy to follow and a patient could complete it without assistance.

**Language** is mostly plain and accessible, though the patient rights section on page 2 includes a dense legal paragraph about conditioning treatment on authorization that would challenge many readers. Page 3 provides item-by-item **completion instructions** — an unusual and genuinely helpful addition that sets this form apart.

**Delivery format options** are exceptional: CD/DVD, Paper, MyChart, USB/Thumb Drive, and Email — five choices, more than nearly any other provider form. **Submission channels** are equally strong: postal mail, fax ((206) 744-9997), and email (uwmedroi@uw.edu), with separate contacts for billing records.

## Barriers

No significant barriers exist. There is **no notarization or witness requirement**, no in-person submission mandate, and no fee disclosure on the form (neither a stated fee nor a stated exemption). The 3-year default authorization expiration is generous. Revocation requires a written request to the Compliance Office — standard but could be more accessible.

One ambiguity: the form includes a blanket statement that the authorization "permits UW Medicine to release information related to sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, behavioral or mental health services, and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse," which could confuse patients about whether signing automatically releases all sensitive categories.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart fast-track** at the top of the form actively diverts patients to faster self-service
- **Five delivery formats** give patients genuine choice
- **Three submission channels** (mail, fax, email) with complete contact information
- **Instruction page** with item-by-item guidance and honest expectations about record completeness
- **Multi-facility coverage** via a single form with clear facility checkboxes
- **Sensitive information opt-in model** for specific unit records (sexual assault, mental health, living donor)

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access form — generic authorization serves all purposes
- No mention of HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or fee limits for patient access
- "PLACE PATIENT LABEL HERE" hospital artifact may confuse patients filling out at home
- Fillable field names are empty in metadata, potentially indicating accessibility deficiencies for screen readers

## Overall Assessment

UW Medical Center provides a **competent, well-designed generic authorization form** with strong digital capabilities and multiple submission options. The MyChart promotion is a standout patient-centering feature that partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway. The form's thorough instruction page, granular record selection, and five delivery formats demonstrate genuine care for usability. The main gap is structural: patients requesting their own records navigate the same form designed for attorneys and insurers, with no acknowledgment that their rights and fee protections differ. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and mostly patient-friendly, but not designed around patient self-access as a primary use case.

# SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison, a community hospital in Wisconsin's capital and part of the SSM Health system, provides three overlapping PDF authorization forms for medical records requests. None of the three forms are specifically designed for patient self-access; all are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" forms that a patient must adapt for their own use. The most relevant form for a patient at this facility is form-3, a location-specific version pre-filled with the Madison PO Box address and fax numbers for Dean Medical Group and SSM Health Hospitals.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found online:

1. **Form-1** (AH-FRM-11595, revised 8/2024): A Wisconsin-wide SSM Health authorization form covering all Wisconsin ministries. Two pages. Most recently updated but not facility-specific.
2. **Form-2** (DPM-2065-035, dated 1/2019): A system-wide SSMHC "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure" form. One page. The only form whose title explicitly includes "Request for Access to" and offers patient access as a named purpose with sub-options (Copy, Inspection, Summary). However, it is outdated (7+ years old), uses the former "SSMHC" branding, and lacks submission instructions entirely.
3. **Form-3** (A9008836, dated 5/2019): A Madison-area-specific authorization form listing St. Mary's Hospital – Madison and five neighboring SSM Health facilities. Two pages. Pre-filled with the Madison PO Box and fax numbers, making it the most actionable form for this facility.

The primary submission pathways are fax (608-294-6294 for Dean Medical Group, 608-270-6815 for SSM Health Hospitals) and postal mail (PO Box 259840, Madison, WI 53725-9840). Phone numbers are provided for inquiries. No online submission portal exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway at this facility. All three forms are structured as general HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. The best patient-access accommodation is found in form-3's "Personal Use" checkbox (Section 4) and the instruction "(If Release is to Self, State Self)" in Section 3. Form-2 goes further with explicit "For personal access" options and "Type of access requested" (Inspection / Hard Copy / Electronic Copy), but it is outdated and lacks facility-specific submission details. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, selecting the correct options to indicate self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was rated **easy**. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without bot blocking or JavaScript barriers. The SSM Health website has a "Get My Medical Records" page, and the location-specific form (form-3) has a well-structured URL path (`.../patients-and-visitors/get-medical-records/wisconsin/st-marys-madison-medical-records-request-form.pdf`). However, the existence of three overlapping forms — with different dates, scopes, and content — creates potential confusion. No guidance is provided about which form to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the most facility-relevant document, is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores and all checkboxes appear as "q" characters, indicating a print-oriented design. A patient must print the form, complete it by hand, and fax or mail it. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence (patient info → recipient → purpose → records scope → format → expiration → signature), and the back page provides thorough patient rights information in an organized bullet-point format. Language is formal but not excessively legalistic. Section 6 offers notably strong delivery format options: MyChart, DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, Fax, and Email — the inclusion of MyChart portal delivery is a genuine bright spot.

Estimated field count for a self-access request is approximately 15 fields (patient demographics, "self" as recipient, purpose selection, record type checkboxes, date range, format, expiration, and signature), which is reasonable.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees for "viewing"**: The back page states SSM Health "may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records." HIPAA does not permit charging patients for inspecting their own records, making the "viewing" language a compliance concern.
- **No 30-day timeline commitment** on form-3 (only form-2 mentions a 30-day response time).
- **Sensitive categories default to inclusion**: Section 5a defaults to disclosing mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and developmental disability records unless the patient explicitly excludes them — a design choice that could lead to unintended disclosure.
- **Outdated forms**: Form-3 dates to 2019, while form-1 was revised in 2024, raising questions about whether form-3 is still current.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart delivery option**: Offering patient portal delivery on the authorization form is uncommon and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **Multiple electronic delivery formats**: Email and fax are also available as delivery options.
- **Comprehensive patient rights information**: The back page covers right to refuse, inspect, copy, revoke, and includes detailed Wisconsin-specific minor consent rules.
- **Photocopy validity clause**: "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" removes a friction point.

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital – Madison earns a **C grade**. The organization makes forms easy to find and provides reasonable delivery format options including MyChart. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the complete absence of fillable form fields, the "viewing" fee language that may overreach HIPAA limits, and the use of a generic third-party authorization form for patient self-access all reflect a process that was not designed with the patient requester in mind. The form is usable but not patient-centered.

# Adena Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Adena Regional Medical Center, a nonprofit community hospital in Chillicothe, Ohio and part of the Adena Health System, provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests. The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — patients requesting their own records must navigate the same form designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. Three documents were found on the organization's medical records request page: two versions of the same ROI authorization form (one current, one outdated) and a fee schedule.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf** (CLI.1777, Rev. 10/25), a one-page "Authorization: Release of Information Form" that serves as the current version. An older version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/02/2020) is also linked from the same page under "Option 3 – By Mail or Fax," creating confusion about which form to use. The fee schedule (form-3.pdf) is a supplementary document published as an image-only scan with no text layer.

Submission is available by mail or fax. Form-2 explicitly lists the fax number (740-779-7769) and mailing address; form-1 does not include a fax number, an oversight that may force patients to hunt for contact information. No online portal submission for records requests was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Adena does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both form versions use a three-way checkbox ("Obtain records from / Release records to / Exchange verbal information with") oriented toward third-party disclosure flows. A patient requesting their own records would need to check "Release records to" and enter their own name as recipient — a non-obvious workflow. The form includes "Personal" as a purpose-of-disclosure option, which is a helpful signal, but there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or any language distinguishing patient-access requests from third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search for the medical records release form surfaced the dedicated medical records request page at `/patients-and-visitors/patient-rights/medical-records-request` on the first attempt. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. All PDFs were directly downloadable. The page is logically located under "Patient Rights," reachable in approximately three clicks from the homepage.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created, text-based PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print the form and complete it by hand (or use a third-party PDF annotation tool). The form fits on a single page, which is commendable for brevity, but the layout is cramped as a result. Sections flow logically (demographics → direction → recipient → date range → record types → purpose → rights → signature), though there are no formal section headers. The record type selection is comprehensive, offering 14 options including an "Abstract" bundle. Language is moderately legalistic, particularly in the "I understand the following" rights section. An "Administrative Use Only – Driver's license number" field at the very top may confuse patients into thinking it's required.

A notable positive: the form explicitly offers electronic delivery of records via email, putting it ahead of many peers. However, no encryption or secure delivery mechanism is mentioned.

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is a **witness signature requirement** — HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient authorizations, and a patient filling out the form at home would need to find a witness, potentially discouraging submission. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which is common but not required by HIPAA and raises data security concerns.

Fee language is problematic: the form states charges "WILL" apply "in accordance with Ohio Law" without distinguishing patient-access requests (subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee cap) from third-party releases (subject to potentially higher state rates). The fee schedule is published proactively on the medical records page — a positive practice — but as an image-only scan it is inaccessible to screen readers, translation tools, and text search.

The psychotherapy notes checkbox requires "approval by psychotherapist," which is appropriate for third-party release but would constitute an impermissible barrier if applied to patient self-access requests.

## Overall Assessment

Adena Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and concise, with some thoughtful features like electronic delivery and comprehensive record type options. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party-oriented design, the witness signature requirement, and ambiguous fee language collectively create a process that works for patients who are persistent but was clearly not designed with patient self-access as a priority. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate but with meaningful room for improvement in both form design and patient-centeredness.

# East Georgia Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

East Georgia Healthcare Center (EGHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Swainsboro, Georgia. Three documents were found on its website: an English-language Medical Records Release form (form-1), a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The critical finding is that **none of these documents serve a patient requesting their own records from EGHC**. Both release forms are designed exclusively for incoming records — authorizing other providers to send records *to* EGHC — with EGHC's own address hardcoded as the destination.

## Access Pathway: The Wrong Form Problem

EGHC exemplifies the "wrong form" problem identified in this study. The Medical Records Release form's key language reads: *"I hereby request copies of all records pertaining to my health history and medical care released to: EAST GEORGIA HEALTHCARE CENTER, 215 NORTH COLEMAN STREET, SWAINSBORO, GA 30401."* The "Requesting medical records from" field is where the patient fills in their *previous* provider. A patient trying to exercise their HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) to obtain records *from* EGHC would find no applicable form anywhere on the website.

The organization does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — it simply does not address patient self-access at all. The Notice of Privacy Practices mentions the right to "inspect and copy medical information" but provides no actionable instructions, no form reference, and no guidance on how to actually submit a request. A patient would likely need to call the Privacy Officer or visit in person, with no written process to guide them.

## Retrieval Experience

The forms page at https://eghc.org/forms/ is findable within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via site navigation. However, the forms are hosted on RightSignature, a third-party e-signature platform, which requires entering a name and email before viewing the form content. Old direct PDF links (from 2019) now return 404 errors but still appear in search engine results, creating confusing dead ends. The retrieval required moderate effort: the forms page was located without difficulty, but extracting the actual form content from RightSignature required technical workarounds (extracting the S3-hosted PNG image and converting to PDF).

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page document with clean layout and clear visual hierarchy: letterhead at top, patient identification fields, destination address, source provider field, a granular 17-option record type checklist, release duration options, legal disclaimer, and signature block. Via the RightSignature platform, the form is interactive with fillable fields and e-signature capability — a meaningful step toward digital-first form handling. However, the standalone captured PDF is image-only with no text layer, no fillable fields, and is completely inaccessible to screen readers.

The language is moderately accessible — the legal disclaimer covers standard HIPAA authorization elements (revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, non-conditioning) without being impenetrably dense. The form collects approximately 10 fields, which is reasonable in scope. However, it requests the patient's Social Security Number, which creates unnecessary data exposure risk given that name, date of birth, and address are already collected.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No patient access form**: The most significant barrier — a patient has no written pathway to request their own records.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers on a form designed for fax/mail transmission is an unnecessary privacy risk.
- **Missing authorization expiration**: The form lacks an explicit expiration date, a required element under 45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(v).
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees for record copies.
- **No submission instructions**: The form text gives no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **RightSignature viewing barrier**: Patients must provide name and email before even viewing the form content.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Both English and Spanish versions of the release form are offered — appropriate for an FQHC serving a diverse community in south-central Georgia.
- **RightSignature e-signature**: Electronic completion and submission capability is a genuine digital-first investment, even if applied to the wrong form.
- **Granular record type selection**: The 17-category checklist with an "Other" option gives patients meaningful control over what information is released.
- **Title X confidentiality**: The NPP includes thoughtful language about Title X Family Planning Program confidentiality.

## Overall Assessment

EGHC has invested in some positive infrastructure — bilingual forms, an e-signature platform, and a navigable forms page — but these investments are undermined by a fundamental gap: the organization provides no form or pathway for patients to request their own records. The only ROI-related forms are designed for incoming records from other providers. A patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access would find their rights acknowledged in the NPP but no actionable way to exercise them online. This represents a significant patient-centeredness failure that overshadows the form's otherwise reasonable document quality.

# The Iowa Clinic — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

The Iowa Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in West Des Moines, Iowa. Notably, the organization has fully transitioned away from downloadable PDF authorization forms: all medical records requests are now handled through third-party online platforms. The two PDF forms evaluated (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf) were retrieved exclusively from the Wayback Machine and date from approximately 2012–2015. They are no longer available on the live website.

## Available Pathways and Current State

The Iowa Clinic's medical records page (https://www.iowaclinic.com/for-patients/payment-billing/medical-records/) routes patients through four distinct channels depending on who is requesting records:

1. **Patient self-requests**: Datavant/Swellbox Health Record Wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/iowa-clinic-wizard.html) — an online portal for patients to request their own records.
2. **Imaging records**: A Formstack-powered web form on the Iowa Clinic website.
3. **Healthcare providers**: A separate Swellbox wizard.
4. **Third-party organizations**: SmartRequest portal (https://smartrequest.com).

This multi-channel architecture is the most relevant finding: The Iowa Clinic **does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release** at the website level, routing patients to a dedicated Swellbox wizard while directing third-party organizations to a separate SmartRequest portal. This structural separation is a meaningful strength.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page itself was straightforward — it's accessible under For Patients > Payment & Billing > Medical Records. However, finding downloadable PDF forms required significant effort since none exist on the current site. The PDFs were only recoverable through Wayback Machine archive searches of defunct URLs (`/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf` and `/static/docs/medical-records-release-form.pdf`). No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Historical Form Quality (form-1.pdf — Primary Evaluated Form)

Form-1.pdf is the newer of the two historical forms — a single-page "Authorization for Release of Information" with a clean digital layout (not a scan), text layer present, but **zero fillable fields**. It would require printing and handwriting. The form has approximately 15 fields including patient demographics, record-type checkboxes (8 options), destination address, purpose of release (6 options plus "Other"), sensitive-information opt-out initials, and signature. The layout follows a logical flow and fits everything on one page without excessive cramming.

The language is a mix of plain and semi-legal. Disclosure paragraphs are readable but contain some dense constructions. The form includes a "Request by patient" purpose option, which is a bright spot — acknowledging patient-initiated access even within a form designed primarily for third-party release. Submission was by fax (515-875-9600) or mail only.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection**: Both forms request Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The electronic transmission clause shifts all liability for misdirected fax/email to the patient, which is an overreach.
- **Fees**: The forms mention a "cost-based fee" without specifying amounts — compliant language but leaves patients unable to anticipate costs.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax and mail were offered as submission methods on the historical forms; the current online portal eliminates even these steps.

## Notable Strengths

The Iowa Clinic's most significant strength is its forward-looking transition to a fully digital, portal-based workflow. By routing patient requests through Swellbox/Datavant — a purpose-built health records request platform — the organization has eliminated the print-fill-fax cycle entirely for patients with internet access. The website's clear separation of patient requests from third-party requests demonstrates awareness of the distinction between individual access rights and authorization-based release.

## Overall Assessment

The Iowa Clinic presents a bifurcated picture. Its **current state** is strong: the organization has modernized beyond PDF forms to online portals with clear pathway differentiation. However, the **historical forms** we could directly evaluate were generic ROI authorization forms with no fillable fields, SSN collection, and liability waivers. Scoring reflects the best available current pathway (the Swellbox portal) while noting that the only downloadable form documents available for detailed quality assessment are from 2012–2015 and no longer represent the patient experience. For a patient requesting their own records today, The Iowa Clinic offers a patient-centered, digitally accessible process.

# Erlanger Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga, TN provides three distinct ROI-related documents: a general system-wide "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form-1), a behavioral health–specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" (form-3). The existence of form-3 — a purpose-built patient access request form — is the key differentiator for this organization and the focus of this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Erlanger is one of the organizations that clearly distinguishes between a patient exercising their right of access and a third-party release authorization. Form-3 is titled "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" and opens with the option to "give me a copy of my health information" — framing the interaction as a patient right rather than an authorization for disclosure. This is structurally separate from form-1, which serves as the general-purpose ROI authorization covering any release direction (to self, third party, insurer, attorney, etc.). The existence of this dedicated pathway shows deliberate organizational awareness that patient access and third-party release are different use cases with different legal frameworks.

However, the dedicated form originates from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital (EWCH) and it is unclear from the form itself whether it applies system-wide. The general ROI form (form-1) does include a "_________myself" option in the "Release Information To" field, providing an alternate pathway through the broader form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. All three were surfaced through a single web search, with no login walls, bot blocking, or broken links. The main erlanger.org site hosts a Medical Records page under patient tools. Form-3's URL is under a "murphy" path that may be associated with a specific facility building, making it less discoverable via direct site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the primary patient access form, is a single-page, digitally authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The layout is clean and logical, flowing from patient identification through facility selection, date range, record type checkboxes, format preference, delivery method, and signature. The language is notably plain and patient-friendly, using first-person phrasing: "I would like," "I want these parts of my record." The form provides granular record selection with 18 options across hospital and office/clinic categories, giving patients meaningful control over scope.

Form-1 (the general ROI) is also digitally authored with a text layer but no fillable fields (2 pages, 14+ record type options). Form-2 (behavioral health) is an image-only scan — inaccessible to screen readers and impossible to fill electronically.

## Submission Methods

Form-3 does not clearly state how to submit the completed form. An "EWCH Use Only" section with "ID Verified" checkboxes implies in-person submission may be expected. However, the broader Erlanger system accepts fax submissions — form-2's instruction page provides a fax number for the HIM department, and form-1 includes fax as a contact/delivery option. Mail is also available. No online portal or email submission option exists for the forms themselves, though secure email is offered as a records *delivery* method.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness requirements exist. The primary patient access form (form-3) is completely silent on fees — patients have no idea if they will be charged. Form-1 mentions "charges may apply" for CD and paper copies but does not specify amounts. Form-3 notes a 30-day turnaround, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Both form-1 and form-3 request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary when combined with name, DOB, and medical record number. Form-1 bundles sensitive-category consent (substance abuse, HIV, mental health) with no opt-out mechanism, which may raise 42 CFR Part 2 concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release — a meaningful structural choice
- **Plain-language, first-person framing** that is unusually patient-friendly
- **Granular record type selection** (18 options across hospital and clinic settings)
- **Secure email as a delivery option** for receiving records
- **Single-page simplicity** for the patient access form

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any form — all require print-and-handwrite workflow
- **No fee disclosure** on the patient access form
- **Unclear submission process** for form-3 (implies in-person with ID verification)
- **No patient rights statement** on the dedicated access form
- **Behavioral health form (form-2)** is an image-only scan with production errors (placeholder text left in)

## Overall Assessment

Erlanger demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form with plain language and granular record selection. The organizational awareness that patient access differs from third-party release is commendable. However, the complete absence of fillable fields, unclear submission instructions, and lack of fee transparency prevent the experience from being truly streamlined. The overall pathway earns a **B** — solid design intent held back by technical and process execution gaps.

# Hendrick Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hendrick Health, a nonprofit regional hospital system based in Abilene, TX, provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records requests — one for the hospital arm (Hendrick Medical Center, including South and Brownwood campuses) and one for the outpatient clinic arm (Hendrick Clinic). Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information, not dedicated patient self-access request forms. No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Hendrick Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting disclosure. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information (PHI)" and frame the transaction as a release between two named parties. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name in the "authorize" blank and again in the "who can receive" section — a workflow designed for attorneys, insurers, and other requestors, not for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The forms do include "Personal Use" as one of seven disclosure reasons, which accommodates patient self-access, but it is not highlighted or explained. There is no mention of the patient's Right of Access, no fee limitation language, and no stated response timeline.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Standard web searches immediately surfaced the Medical Records page (hendrickhealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/), which links directly to both PDFs with clear descriptions. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, login wall, or browser automation was required. The URLs are descriptive and stable. This is a findability bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1 (hospital)** is the stronger of the two forms and represents the best available pathway. It is a single-page flat PDF (zero fillable fields) with a text layer — digitally created from a Word document but exported without interactive form fields. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit via fax (325-670-6538), mail, email, or in-person pickup. The Hendrick Service Center address and contact information are pre-populated, reducing patient guesswork.

The form is organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → sensitive record initials → reason for disclosure → legal text → party identification → signatures. Record type granularity is a strength, with 16+ specific checkboxes plus an "all health information" option. However, the legal text in the lower third is dense, small-font legalese citing Texas Health & Safety Code § 181.154(c) and 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(1). No plain-language summary of patient rights is provided.

**Form-2 (clinic)** is structurally identical but notably weaker: it omits the email delivery option, lacks pre-filled contact information (leaving patients unsure where to submit), and omits a dates-of-service field. Patients who received care at both hospital and clinic entities would need to complete two separate forms with no cross-referencing guidance.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization, witness, or in-person submission is required — these are positive absences. Fees are not mentioned at all (neither disclosed nor waived). The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is unnecessary for HIPAA-compliant record identification but is a minor rather than severe barrier.

Both forms misspell "HIPAA" as "HIPPA" — a factual error that appears in the opening paragraph and undermines credibility. Form-2's PDF metadata exposes internal document management details ("Page 2__05.2022 MASTER-Authorization to Obtain or Release PHI- - Copy.docx"), suggesting careless export. The title of form-1 ("Authorization to Release Health Information") contradicts its subtitle ("Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information"), creating directional confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery** on the hospital form is uncommon and provides a digital delivery pathway
- **Pre-populated facility contact information** on form-1 reduces patient burden
- **Granular record selection** gives patients meaningful control over what is released
- **Single-page format** keeps the form manageable despite dense content

## Overall Assessment

Hendrick Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find and free of major barriers, but the organization channels all requestors — patients, attorneys, insurers — through the same generic authorization form without acknowledging that patient self-access is a distinct right with different rules. The flat, non-fillable PDFs represent a missed opportunity for digital-first design, and the split between hospital and clinic forms adds unnecessary complexity. A patient can get their records here without undue hardship, but the process was clearly not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Fisher-Titus Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fisher-Titus Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit community hospital in Norwalk, Ohio. Three documents were downloaded from the organization's website: two versions of the same "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form (form-1.pdf revised 11/2024 and form-3.pdf revised 07/2025, both carrying form number FTC24-5) and an unrelated Emergency Medical Authorization form (form-2.pdf) for minor children. The relevant documents for patient self-access are the two ROI authorization forms, with form-3.pdf being the more current revision.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient Self-Access Accommodation

Fisher-Titus does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. Instead, it provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose PHI" form that serves all release-of-information purposes — patient self-access, third-party releases to attorneys, insurers, and other providers alike. However, the form includes a notable accommodation: a **"Self (same info as above)" checkbox** in the recipient section (Section 2), which explicitly lets patients indicate they are requesting their own records without having to fill out a separate recipient name and address. A "Personal" purpose option in Section 4 further supports this use case.

Despite these accommodations, the form's framing — titled "Authorization to Disclose PHI" — and its overall design orient around third-party disclosure. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access, no plain-language explanation of patient rights, and no guidance distinguishing the patient self-access process from a third-party release. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different primary audience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. It is reachable within two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Guests → Patient Forms) and is also available on a dedicated Medical Records page (/medical-records). No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-rendered links were encountered. URLs are descriptively named. The two independent navigation paths to the form are above average for a community hospital. One confusing element: the Patient Forms page links to the older revision (form-1.pdf) while the Medical Records page links to the newer revision (form-3.pdf), with no indication to the patient which version is current.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-3.pdf, revised 07/2025) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with extractable text. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as typographic underscores, and checkboxes are non-interactive Unicode characters. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand or use a PDF annotation tool. This is a print-first design distributed digitally.

The form's structure is well-organized with **eight clearly numbered sections** following a logical progression: patient info → recipient → treatment location → purpose → record types → format/delivery → sensitive information consent → expiration/signature. Section 5 provides impressively granular record selection with approximately 17 specific record type checkboxes (discharge summaries, H&P, operative reports, lab, pathology, radiology images, immunizations, ED records, etc.), each with date fields. Patients can request their entire record or specific items.

The language is **moderately clear** — section headers are descriptive and the flow is intuitive, but legal boilerplate in Sections 7 and 8 uses complex sentence structures typical of authorization forms. A patient of average literacy could complete the form, though the dense Section 5 and legal consent language may slow them down. Approximately 20–25 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN requested**: Section 1 asks for "SS#" (Social Security Number), which is unnecessary for patient access under HIPAA and creates identity theft risk on a form that may be faxed.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Witness Signature" line appears at the bottom with no explanation of when or whether a witness is required, potentially deterring patients who lack a convenient witness.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: The form states Fisher-Titus "may charge a fee" but provides no fee schedule, amounts, or indication of whether patient self-access requests are free.
- **Two conflicting versions online**: The older and newer revisions differ in content (sensitive information categories, specialty office listings) but share the same form number, risking patient confusion.

## Bright Spots

- **Encrypted email as a delivery format**: Fisher-Titus offers encrypted email alongside CD, flash drive, and paper for records delivery — a progressive option for a community hospital.
- **Granular record selection**: The 17+ record type checkboxes with date fields give patients fine-grained control over their request scope.
- **"Self" checkbox**: The explicit self-request accommodation, while not a dedicated patient form, reduces friction compared to forms that only contemplate third-party recipients.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Fax numbers are listed for each treatment location, and mail and in-person options are available — ensuring patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fisher-Titus Medical Center provides an accessible, reasonably well-designed records request process hampered by a print-only form design and a generic authorization framework that does not truly center patient self-access. The form is easy to find, logically organized, and offers progressive delivery options including encrypted email. However, the lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of patient rights language or fee transparency pull the overall experience down. A patient can successfully request their own records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience with that patient in mind as the primary audience.

# Brattleboro Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, an independent nonprofit community hospital in Brattleboro, Vermont, publishes three ROI-related forms on its website. All three are general-purpose HIPAA disclosure authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to or from third parties. None is a dedicated patient access request form. The most current version — form-1.pdf, dated January 2025 — serves as the primary pathway for any patient requesting their own records, though patients must navigate a third-party-oriented workflow to do so.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three forms use a FROM/TO structure designed for transfers between parties. A patient requesting their own records would need to select the "Personal Records" purpose checkbox (available only on form-1 and form-3, not form-2) and enter their own name in the "TO" field — a workable but unintuitive approach. There is no online portal, patient portal integration, or web-based request wizard. The hospital's HIM Department lists a phone number (802-257-8258) and fax number (802-257-8881) on the form header, providing fax as an electronic submission channel, though the form itself never explicitly states how to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Standard web searches immediately returned direct PDF links hosted on the hospital's WordPress site. No login, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. However, the three overlapping forms are published without any landing page, version guidance, or indication of which is current. A patient who finds form-2 (older, shorter, with a witness line and 6-month default expiration) gets a materially different experience than one who finds form-1 (updated, more comprehensive, 12-month expiration, no witness line).

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1.pdf** (the best available) is a 2-page flat PDF. Despite retrieval notes suggesting fillable fields, metadata confirms zero interactive form fields — all blanks are underscore lines and text-rendered checkbox characters. Patients must print, handwrite, and submit via fax or physical delivery. The two-page structure is logical (instructions/rights on page 1, data entry on page 2), and required fields are marked with an asterisk convention. However, page 2 is densely packed with FROM/TO fields, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, verbal communication designees, date ranges, and signature blocks. Some checkbox labels are misaligned across columns. The language mixes plain statements with ALL CAPS instructions and bureaucratic phrasing — Instruction 4, which conditions processing on internal record completeness, is particularly confusing for patients.

The form offers approximately 15 fields for patient completion, a reasonable scope. Record-type checkboxes are comprehensive, covering standard categories plus sensitive information (psychiatric, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, hepatitis) and notably progressive categories (reproductive health care, gender affirming care). Delivery options are limited to "Pick Up" and "Send Out" with no electronic delivery mentioned.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on form-1 (though form-2 includes a witness line that may create perceived barriers). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "in accordance with state and federal law" — without specific amounts or a fee schedule. No response time commitment is stated. The form does not require in-person submission, and fax is available as an electronic submission pathway.

## Notable Strengths

- **Progressive sensitive-information categories**: The January 2025 revision includes Reproductive Health Care and Gender Affirming Care checkboxes — unusually inclusive for a community hospital.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to receive health services" directly addresses a common patient concern.
- **Verbal communication designees**: A dedicated section for authorizing up to three individuals for verbal communication with the hospital goes beyond typical ROI forms.
- **Easy online availability**: Forms are publicly accessible without any barriers to download.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: All forms funnel patients through a generic third-party disclosure workflow.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: The primary form cannot be completed digitally despite its digitally-authored appearance.
- **Multiple unversioned forms**: Three overlapping documents with no guidance creates confusion.
- **No electronic delivery options**: Only physical pickup or mail for receiving records.
- **No explicit submission instructions**: Fax and phone numbers are listed but the form never tells patients how to submit it.

## Overall Assessment

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The forms are easy to find and free of egregious barriers, and the January 2025 update shows thoughtfulness around sensitive health categories. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, non-fillable form format, and absence of electronic delivery options place the hospital behind peers who have modernized their records request processes. The overall experience earns a **C grade** — functional but not patient-centered.

# Riverwood Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Riverwood Healthcare Center is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Aitkin, MN. It maintains a Patient Forms page with multiple release-of-information documents and offers both printable PDF and online JotForm submission options. Three PDF forms were found (from 2015, 2018, and 2025), all general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms for releasing patient information. The organization also uses MyChart (OCHIN) for patient portal access, though this is not positioned as a records request channel on the Patient Forms page.

## Available Forms and Pathways

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3.pdf** (2025), the current "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" linked from the Patient Forms page as the "Printable Form." Two older versions (2018 and 2015) remain publicly accessible at their original WordPress upload URLs but are no longer linked from the main forms page. All three forms share essentially the same structure: patient demographics, release from/to fields, purpose checkboxes, record type selections, sensitive information opt-out, and standard HIPAA authorization language.

Critically, Riverwood also offers **HIPAA-compliant JotForm online submission** (https://hipaa.jotform.com/222405586410046) as an alternative to the printable PDF. This provides a fully digital workflow — no printing, handwriting, or faxing required. A second JotForm for "Consent for Release of Information" and a third for "Permission to Verbally Discuss PHI" are also available. These online options represent a meaningful accessibility advantage over the PDF-only approach.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Riverwood does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three PDF forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for releasing information from one entity to another. A patient requesting their own records must use the same from/to structure intended for third-party transfers — listing themselves in the "Release Information To" field. The "Personal Use" purpose checkbox is available, signaling that self-requests are anticipated, but there is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no statement of patient rights.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A simple web search for Riverwood's ROI form surfaced direct PDF links immediately. The Patient Forms page is accessible in one click from the main site navigation and provides organized links to both printable and online form options. The only concern is that outdated form versions (2015, 2018) remain publicly accessible, meaning a patient arriving via search engine could encounter a superseded form.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a **single-page, digitally composed PDF** with a clean layout, clear section headers, and notably helpful parenthetical plain-language guidance (e.g., "RELEASE INFORMATION FROM (WHO HAS THE INFORMATION YOU WANT RELEASED?)"). This design choice makes the form substantially more approachable than typical legal-style ROI forms.

However, the PDF has **zero fillable fields** — all checkboxes are Unicode characters (☐) rendered as text, not interactive elements. A patient must print and hand-fill the form. The JotForm alternative addresses this gap for patients who find it. The form does not collect Social Security Numbers (an improvement over the 2015 version, which did), and does not require a witness signature (also improved from the 2015 version).

Field count is reasonable at approximately 15–18 fields including demographics, from/to addresses, purpose, date range, record type selections, and signature. The authorization language is standard but dense, packed into two paragraphs with no visual breaks between concepts.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** on the current form — a positive.
- **Fax submission available** (218-927-5319), providing an electronic submission pathway beyond the JotForm.
- **No fees disclosed** on any form — appropriate for the authorization itself, though patients are not informed about potential costs.
- **Sensitive information defaults to release:** The form states "All information regarding chemical dependency will be released unless you restrict by initialing." This opt-out approach for 42 CFR Part 2–protected substance abuse records is the most significant compliance concern.
- **"Guardian" misspelled as "Gaurdian"** on the current form — a minor but unprofessional error.
- **Ambiguous revocation language:** The form requires patients to "present" written revocation to the Medical Records Department, which could be read as requiring in-person delivery.

## Overall Assessment

Riverwood Healthcare Center provides a **competent but undifferentiated** records request experience. The organization earns credit for easy findability, offering both printable and online submission options (via JotForm), and producing a clean single-page form with helpful plain-language guidance. The JotForm option is a genuine bright spot that elevates the digital experience. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the generic authorization form design, the non-fillable PDF, and the concerning opt-out model for sensitive information prevent a higher rating. This is a typical small critical access hospital approach — functional but not patient-centered.

# Minnie Hamilton Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Minnie Hamilton Health System (MHHS) is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Grantsville, West Virginia, affiliated with Mon Health. The organization does not publish any downloadable ROI or patient access form on its website. Instead, it directs all medical records requests through ChartRequest, a third-party online portal. Two documents were downloaded during this evaluation: a patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) and a Mon Health Medical Center authorization form (form-2.pdf) from the affiliate system — neither is an MHHS-branded records request form.

## Access Pathway

MHHS routes patients to ChartRequest (https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville) for medical records requests. This is an online portal where the authorization form is embedded in the electronic workflow. While portal-based submission is inherently electronic and potentially convenient, ChartRequest requires account creation before a patient can even see the authorization form or understand the terms of the request. This creates opacity — patients cannot preview the form, understand fee structures, or assess what information they'll need to provide before committing to a third-party account.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ChartRequest portal appears to be a general records release platform, not a pathway specifically designed for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. There is no publicly visible indication that MHHS has a separate, streamlined process for patients requesting their own records.

MHHS also maintains an Athena Health patient portal for clinical messaging, but the only downloaded document about it (form-1.pdf) covers sending documents *to* providers — the opposite direction of a records request. Whether a patient could request records through a portal message is unclear; the website directs records requests exclusively through ChartRequest.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding records request information for MHHS was **hard**. An extensive search process — multiple query variations, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine CDX API queries, and direct website navigation — failed to surface any downloadable ROI form. The MHHS website has no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. The website does link to ChartRequest from the patients page, but there is no standalone form to evaluate. The Mon Health authorization form (form-2.pdf) was located only by broadening the search to the affiliate system and is branded exclusively for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — a separate facility approximately 150 miles away.

## Form Document Quality

Because MHHS does not publish a standalone form, there is no primary form to assess for document quality in the traditional sense. The ChartRequest portal workflow could not be evaluated without creating an account. The Mon Health form (form-2.pdf), while not applicable to MHHS, provides the closest reference point: it is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) with dense content, a 4.1 MB file size (extremely bloated with 40 embedded images and 107 fonts), and no instructions for patients. It is a generic third-party authorization form that includes "Personal Use" as one purpose option but is not designed around patient self-access.

The patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) is well-written with numbered steps and plain language, suggesting MHHS is capable of producing clear patient-facing materials — but this capability was not applied to the records request process.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The primary barrier is **gatekeeping behind account creation**. Patients must create a ChartRequest account before they can access the authorization form or learn anything about the records request process. For patients with limited internet access or digital literacy — a real concern in rural Grantsville, WV — this is a significant obstacle. There is no phone-based or paper-based alternative publicly documented on the website, though the medical records department phone number (304-354-9700, ext. 2521) is listed.

No fee information is publicly available. No response time commitment is published. No patient rights information is accessible before engaging with the ChartRequest platform. The lack of any publicly visible authorization terms means patients cannot make informed decisions about the process before entering it.

## Strengths

- **Electronic submission pathway**: The ChartRequest portal provides a fully digital workflow, eliminating the need for printing, faxing, or mailing paper forms.
- **Digital-first approach**: MHHS has adopted modern platforms (Athena Health portal, ChartRequest) rather than relying solely on paper-based processes.
- **Clear instructional writing**: The patient portal guide demonstrates an ability to produce accessible, well-structured patient materials.

## Overall Assessment

Minnie Hamilton Health System presents a paradox: it has adopted a modern electronic records request platform, but in doing so has made the process less transparent and less accessible than many organizations that simply post a PDF form. The complete absence of a publicly available authorization form, fee schedule, timeline, or patient rights information means that MHHS patients enter the records request process with no visibility into what to expect. The reliance on a third-party platform with mandatory account creation creates an unnecessary gatekeeping barrier, particularly problematic for a rural critical access hospital serving a population that may have limited internet access. While the ChartRequest workflow may be well-designed internally, the opaque exterior facing patients undermines what could otherwise be a modern, patient-friendly approach.

# MountainView Hospital (Las Vegas, NV) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MountainView Hospital is part of HCA Healthcare's Sunrise Health network in Las Vegas. The facility's own domain (`mountainview-hospital.com`) redirects to the Sunrise Health system website at `sunrisehealthinfo.com`, where all medical records information is centralized. Two PDF forms were found—an English and Spanish version of the same standardized HCA Healthcare authorization form—alongside references to two additional digital pathways: an online Swellbox records request portal and the MyHealthONE patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The medical records page at sunrisehealthinfo.com offers three pathways for patients requesting records: (1) a downloadable PDF authorization form (in English and Spanish), (2) an online request wizard via Swellbox, and (3) the MyHealthONE patient portal. The primary downloadable form (form-1.pdf, HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21) is a system-wide HCA Healthcare standardized authorization used across all HCA facilities, not specific to MountainView Hospital. The Swellbox portal represents the most streamlined digital option, though the PDF form remains the most prominently linked resource.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MountainView Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The single authorization form serves both patient self-requests and third-party release, with a radio-button choice between "At the request of the individual" and "Other 3rd party recipient." While a patient *can* use this form to request their own records, the form's framing—with prominent "Recipient" fields, fax-to-provider-only restrictions, and third-party disclosure language—is clearly oriented toward release-of-information scenarios rather than individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. The form makes no distinction between Right of Access fee limits/timelines and general authorization practices.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was relatively easy. The medical records page is accessible via the main navigation ("For Patients → Medical Records"), and the authorization forms are directly linked with clear labels. The one complication was bot protection: curl requests to the initial download URL returned HTML rather than a PDF, requiring discovery of the actual CDN URL at `hcadam.com`. This is a minor technical obstacle that wouldn't affect a patient using a browser.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a single-page, fully interactive PDF with 52 fillable fields—patients can complete it digitally without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (patient/recipient info, marketing/PHI sale, signatures), with 16 specific record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. Four delivery format options are offered: paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure). The form also includes a rare USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release option, a forward-looking feature for structured data export.

However, the single-page constraint makes the layout quite dense, and some terminology (USCDI, Direct Address, NPI) is jargon that would be opaque to most patients. The language is a mix of plain language and legalese—the six "I understand that..." statements are reasonably clear, but the overall form assumes familiarity with medical records processes.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked optional but unnecessary for records authorization and a data minimization concern.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form states patients may obtain copies "for a reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts, and this language appears in a rights statement that could normalize fee collection even for Right of Access requests.
- **Fax restriction**: "(FAX only to Physician Office / Medical facility)" limits fax delivery destinations and may restrict patient choice.
- **No notarization or witness required**—a positive.
- **No in-person requirement**: Mail, fax, and online portal options are all available.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual**: Full Spanish translation (form-2.pdf) available alongside the English version—meaningful for Las Vegas's significant Spanish-speaking population, though the surrounding web pages remain English-only and some form footer elements were left untranslated.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare and forward-looking inclusion of interoperability standards on an ROI form.
- **Multiple electronic delivery choices**: Four format options with honest risk disclosures.
- **Alternative digital pathways**: Swellbox portal and MyHealthONE patient portal provide additional request channels beyond the PDF.
- **52 fillable fields**: Fully digital-first form design.

## Overall Assessment

MountainView Hospital, through HCA Healthcare's standardized forms and Sunrise Health's website, provides a reasonably accessible records request experience. The form is easy to find, technically well-built, and offers meaningful delivery format choices. The main weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway—patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization form that doesn't distinguish Right of Access rights, fee limits, or timelines. The availability of the Swellbox online portal and MyHealthONE partially compensates for this gap by offering alternative digital pathways. The form earns credit for its fillable design, Spanish availability, and USCDI awareness, but loses points for its generic framing, fee ambiguity, and unnecessary SSN collection.

# University Medical Center of Southern Nevada — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC) is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Las Vegas. Three documents were retrieved: two versions of the same PHI Release Authorization form (a current 2019 version and a superseded 2016 version) and a Request for Amendment form. The primary form for patient self-access is the 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

UMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting one's own records is a generic "Protected Health Information (PHI) Release Authorization" form — the same form used for third-party disclosures to attorneys, insurers, and other providers. The form includes a "Patient (self)" checkbox under the recipient section, which adapts it for self-access use, but the framing remains third-party-oriented: "I authorize the following facility(ies) to release my Protected Health Information." A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access must navigate the same full authorization form as someone authorizing release to a third party, including selecting a "purpose" (Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Care) — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access requests.

## Findability: A Significant Gap

The most striking finding is a disconnect between the website and the ROI form. UMC's Medical Records page (`umcsn.com/patients-visitors/patient-information/medical-records-and-birth-certificate-process`) links only to the Request for Amendment form — it does **not** link to the PHI Release Authorization that patients need to request copies of their records. The ROI form is only discoverable via web search or by knowing the direct URL. Compounding this, the superseded 2016 version remains hosted at an active URL with no indication it is obsolete, meaning patients could unknowingly submit the wrong version. This is a serious findability failure for a core patient rights document.

## Form Document Quality

The 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf) is a two-page, digitally-composed PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (9 fonts, 3 embedded images), it offers no interactive form fields. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and then determine how to submit it.

The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → facility selection → record type selection → sensitive information consent → recipient → purpose/format → legal statements → signature. The structure is reasonable, but institutional conventions undermine usability. The header instruction "PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" assumes clinical context meaningless to a patient at home. An unexplained barcode-like code ("*ROIRCD*") appears at the top. The header states "Page 1 of 1" on what is actually a 2-page document.

Language is mostly clear but formal. The sensitive information section deserves credit for its granular, well-explained approach — five categories (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, psychotherapy, genetic records) each with individual Yes/No consent and required initials.

## Submission: A Critical Omission

The ROI form specifies how records will be *delivered* to the patient (mail, fax, email, CD-ROM, pick-up) but does **not** state how to *submit the completed authorization*. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or portal URL appears on the form for submission. The only address on the form is for written revocation. By contrast, the amendment form (form-3) provides four clear submission channels: mail, walk-in, fax (702-207-8330), and email (HIMManagementAnalysts@umcsn.com). A patient would need to locate this information independently — likely from the Medical Records page that paradoxically doesn't link to the ROI form.

## Barriers and Compliance

UMC avoids several common barriers: no notarization is required, Social Security Number is explicitly marked as optional, and the form includes good rights language (voluntariness, non-conditioning of treatment, right to revoke). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "subject to reproduction fees in accordance with federal / state regulations" — without specifying amounts or noting that fees for patient self-access are limited by law. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions found.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular sensitive information controls**: Five-category consent with individual opt-in/opt-out is better than most ROI forms
- **Email as a delivery option**: Listed alongside mail, fax, CD-ROM, and pick-up
- **SS# marked optional**: Explicit labeling that many forms omit
- **"Patient (self)" checkbox**: Acknowledges patient self-access as a use case

## Overall Assessment

UMC provides a functional but poorly surfaced records request process. The form itself is adequate — clearly structured with good sensitive-information handling and reasonable rights language. But the patient experience is undermined by three compounding failures: the form isn't linked from the obvious website location, it isn't fillable despite being digitally composed, and it doesn't tell patients how to submit it. A patient navigating UMC's website in the expected way would find the amendment form but not the release authorization form. The organization treats records release as an institutional process that patients happen to participate in, rather than as a patient right that deserves a dedicated, discoverable pathway.

# Natividad Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Natividad Medical Center, a government-owned community hospital in Salinas, CA, hosts two ROI authorization forms on its medical records page at `https://www.natividad.com/medical-records/`:

- **Form 1** (2019): A 1-page "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — an image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields. Despite being the newer version, it is a grayscale scan at 200 DPI that cannot be read by screen readers or completed digitally.
- **Form 2** (2007): A 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" created from Microsoft Word. It has a text layer but is copy-protected (RC4 encryption) and also lacks fillable fields. It requests Social Security Number and contains a garbled legal citation.

Both forms serve the same general purpose — authorizing release of health information — and both remain linked from the website with no guidance on which is current or preferred.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. However, Form 1 does include explicit patient access language: "If you are the patient requesting your own records, you may choose between printed copies or CD." It also includes a "Patient" checkbox among requester roles. Form 2 has a "Patient request" checkbox under Purpose but is structurally oriented toward third-party release, requiring the patient to name a "release to" recipient — awkward when requesting one's own records.

The organization does not differentiate individual access from third-party authorization through separate forms, sections, or pathways. A patient must navigate a form designed for a different use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. A general web search for medical records release forms surfaced both PDFs, and a site-specific search confirmed the medical records page. The presence of two overlapping forms with unclear currency creates confusion — a patient finding both would not know which to use. The filename "Auth_ROI_e.pdf" for Form 2 is cryptic and unhelpful. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Neither form is fillable — both require printing and completion by hand. Form 1's image-only format makes it completely inaccessible to assistive technology, likely violating Section 508 and WCAG standards for a government facility. Form 2's text layer is an improvement but copy-protection prevents text selection. Both forms use underscore-line blanks for data entry.

Form 1 packs substantial content onto a single page with cramped layout. Section headings exist but are not strongly differentiated from body text in the scanned format. Form 2 is better organized with clear section headers (USE AND DISCLOSURE, PURPOSE, EXPIRATION, MY RIGHTS, SIGNATURE) and logical flow across two pages, though footnotes descend into dense legal prose.

Language is generally plain in both forms, though both include legal phrasing that may challenge patients with limited health literacy. Neither form provides clear instructions for completion.

## Barriers

- **No electronic submission pathway documented**: Neither form specifies how to submit — no fax number, email address, or portal is mentioned. The forms only address what information to release, not how to submit the request.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate charges.
- **Outdated delivery options**: Form 1 states "Natividad policy is to provide all electronic records on a CD" — CDs are increasingly obsolete, and this may functionally limit patients' right to receive records electronically.
- **SSN collection** (Form 2): Requesting Social Security Number is unnecessary for HIPAA requests and creates identity-theft risk.
- **Blank revocation address** (Form 2): The form instructs patients to submit revocations "to the following address" but leaves the address blank.

## Bright Spots

- Form 1 explicitly addresses patients requesting their own records and offers format choices.
- Form 1's opt-out exclusion model (defaulting to full disclosure with options to exclude HIV, substance abuse, mental health records) is patient-friendly.
- Form 1 dropped the SSN requirement present in Form 2, showing incremental improvement.
- Both forms include patient rights language covering refusal, no-retaliation, revocation, and right to a copy.

## Overall Assessment

Natividad Medical Center provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly maintained patient access experience. The organization relies on generic third-party authorization forms rather than a dedicated patient access pathway. The newer form (2019) is paradoxically less accessible than the older one (2007) due to its image-only scan format — a regression in digital accessibility. Neither form is fillable, no electronic submission method is documented, and the dual-form situation with no guidance creates unnecessary confusion. For a government-owned facility, the accessibility failures are particularly concerning. The org earns a **C grade**, reflecting a process that technically exists but was not designed with patient self-access in mind.

# JPS Health Network — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

JPS Health Network (John Peter Smith Hospital) is a government-owned community hospital in Fort Worth, TX. The organization's Patient Records page offers three downloadable forms: a primary ROI authorization form (English, with a Spanish version also available), an HIE opt-in authorization, and an HIE revocation form. Only the ROI form (form-1) is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records.

## Forms & Pathways

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is a single-page **Authorization & Request for Release of Information** PDF (form-1.pdf), last revised October 2018. This is a generic ROI form — it does not differentiate between patient self-access requests under HIPAA § 164.524 and third-party release authorizations. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no patient portal pathway mentioned on the records page.

The two HIE-related forms (form-2 and form-3) are irrelevant to patient self-access — they govern provider-to-provider data sharing via a health information exchange.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The Patient Records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records), and web searches also surface the direct PDF URL. The page uses accordion sections to organize content, with the ROI form under "JPS Authorization Form." Fee information and submission instructions are disclosed on the page before download — a transparency positive.

## Form Document Quality

The ROI form is the weakest element of JPS's patient access process. It is an **image-only scan** — a photograph of a paper form with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no extractable text (literally 1 character of output from text extraction). At 478 KB for a single page, it is technically a picture, not a document. It cannot be completed digitally, is invisible to screen readers, and fails basic digital accessibility standards.

The irony is sharp: JPS's 2025 HIE forms demonstrate the organization can produce modern, fillable, text-searchable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The core ROI form — the one patients actually need — remains a 2018 scan that has not been updated in over seven years.

The form is one page, which is an appropriate length. However, because it is an image-only scan, detailed analysis of layout, language clarity, field count, and instructions is limited to visual inspection rather than text analysis.

## Access Pathway Assessment

JPS does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The single ROI form appears to serve all release purposes. The fee schedule on the web page does not distinguish between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees (which Texas state law governs at higher rates). This conflation is a significant patient-centeredness gap.

Submission is limited to **print, handwrite, and mail or fax**. The Patient Records page explicitly states: "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time." Fax is available (which counts as an adequate electronic pathway and avoids the worst penalties), but the form itself cannot be filled digitally — it must be printed and handwritten.

## Barriers

- **Potentially excessive fees**: $30 for the first 10 pages, per-page charges thereafter, and a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery. The $75 electronic delivery fee likely exceeds HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based" standard for patient access requests. The fee schedule does not distinguish patient access from third-party requests.
- **No electronic form submission**: Despite having the technical capability (demonstrated by HIE forms accepting encrypted email), JPS refuses electronic submission of the ROI form.
- **Government photo ID required at pickup**: Standard practice but limits delivery to in-person collection.
- **Stale form**: Over 7 years old, predating HHS Right of Access enforcement actions and 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish language version** available for the ROI form, appropriate for Fort Worth demographics.
- **Fee disclosure** is transparent — patients know costs before downloading the form.
- **Easy findability** — the form is prominent and well-organized on the website.
- **HIE forms show capability** — the 2025 HIE forms prove JPS can do better, which makes the outdated ROI form a choice rather than a limitation.

## Overall Assessment

JPS Health Network presents a frustrating contradiction. The organization clearly has the technical capability and institutional will to produce modern, accessible digital forms — the 2025 HIE forms are well-designed, fillable, and accept encrypted email submission. Yet the core ROI form that patients actually need to request their own records remains a seven-year-old image scan with no digital functionality. Combined with potentially excessive fees and no electronic submission, the patient experience is well below what this organization could deliver. The form is easy to find, and fax submission is available, but the document itself is a relic that creates unnecessary barriers for patients exercising their access rights.

# Texas Oncology — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Texas Oncology provides a single ROI form — an "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf). Both are 3-page fillable PDFs, structurally identical, revised 09/19/2024. They are available as direct downloads from a dedicated Medical Records page at texasoncology.com/medical-records. The page outlines a clear 3-step process: download the form, complete it, and submit by fax or mail.

No patient portal submission, online request wizard, or third-party vendor platform (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was found. The only request pathway is the downloadable PDF form submitted by fax or mail.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Texas Oncology does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party disclosure. The single form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering nine disclosure reasons — Treatment, Personal Use, Billing, Legal Purposes, Disability Determination, School, Employment, Health Oversight, and Other. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" and then navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios, including filling in both "I authorize the following to disclose" (naming Texas Oncology) and "Who can receive and use the health information?" (naming themselves). This is awkward when the requester and recipient are the same person.

Notably, page 2 of the form includes a legally accurate statement that "This form is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual," citing 45 CFR §§ 164.502(a)(1)(i) and 164.524. However, this critical information is buried in supplementary legal text — not surfaced on page 1 where a patient would see it before completing the 3-page form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible from footer navigation (approximately one click from the homepage). While older PDF URLs found via web search returned 404 errors due to a site migration to Sitecore Edge CDN, the live page links worked without issue. No bot blocking, login walls, or captchas were encountered. Overall retrieval difficulty: easy to moderate — the slight complication was dead legacy URLs, but the current page is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed fillable PDF with 95 interactive fields — a thoroughly digitized form designed for on-screen completion. The layout is clean and logical: patient demographics → reason for disclosure → authorizing party → recipient → delivery method → record types → time period → signature. Section headers in all caps provide clear visual hierarchy.

The form offers 16 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, radiology reports, pathology, etc.) plus "All Health Information" and "Other," giving patients meaningful granularity. Four sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, genetic information, HIV/AIDS) require separate initialing, consistent with HIPAA and Texas law.

The language is reasonably plain for a legal authorization form. The statement that treatment cannot be denied for refusing to sign is prominently placed at the top of page 1 — better positioning than many ROI forms. However, the fee language on page 2 contains a grammatical error ("There may charge a retrieval/processing fee") and fails to specify amounts or distinguish patient-access fees from third-party disclosure fees.

The 95 fillable fields lack semantic names in the PDF metadata (all field names are empty), which impairs accessibility for screen readers and assistive technology.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Barriers are low to moderate.** No notarization is required — only a patient signature. No in-person submission is required; fax and mail are both accepted. The authorization expiration is reasonable (valid until death, revocation, or optional specified date). Right to revoke is clearly stated. The form includes current reproductive health protections (45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)) with a dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page — demonstrating up-to-date compliance with 2024 federal rules.

The main barrier is the lack of electronic submission: despite the fillable PDF and email as a records *delivery* option, patients must still print, sign, and fax or mail the form. There is no e-signature, portal upload, or online submission pathway.

Fee disclosure is vague — "a retrieval/processing fee may be charged" without specifics. No response time commitment is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: A professionally translated Spanish version is offered as a parallel download — commendable for a Texas-based practice serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **Reproductive health protections**: The dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page is current with 2024 federal law.
- **Email delivery option**: Records can be delivered via email, providing a practical electronic access mechanism.
- **Treatment-not-conditioned**: Prominently positioned at the top of page 1.

## Overall Assessment

Texas Oncology provides a competent but generic records request experience. The form is well-built as a document — fillable, logically organized, bilingual, and legally current. However, it funnels patients through a third-party authorization process rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. The buried acknowledgment that the form "is not required" for patient self-access only underscores this mismatch. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience. The organization earns a **B** grade — solid document quality and accessibility, held back by the lack of a patient-centered access pathway.

# Maury Regional Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Maury Regional Health, a nonprofit regional system based in Columbia, TN (encompassing Maury Regional Medical Center, Marshall Medical Center, Wayne Medical Center, and Maury Regional Medical Group), provides a reasonably accessible records request experience with several notable strengths — particularly multilingual availability and multiple delivery channels — but falls short of best-in-class by relying on a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms were found, both linked from the Medical Records page (`/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/`):

- **Form 1 (Form 131, 08/2018):** English-language "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a single-page, general-purpose ROI form.
- **Form 2 (Form 131S, 05/2017):** Spanish-language translation of the same form, though dated over a year earlier and containing content discrepancies.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, the medical records page also offers an **online request portal via Swellbox** and access through the **My Maury Health Patient Portal**, giving patients three distinct channels. Fax submission (931.380.4092) and phone contact (931.380.4089) are also listed.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Maury Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single form serves all purposes — requesting your own records, releasing to an attorney, sending to an insurer, etc. However, the form does accommodate patient access by listing "Myself" as the first option in the recipient field and including "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox. A patient can use this form, but must navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios (specifying a recipient name/address, selecting among purposes that don't apply). The availability of the Swellbox online portal is a meaningful alternative that may provide a more streamlined patient experience, though the portal itself was not evaluated in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A site-scoped search immediately surfaced the medical records page. The page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Medical Records). PDFs are hosted on Cloudinary CDN and downloaded without authentication or bot blocking. The only minor difficulty was a 403 error from the web_fetch tool on the medical records page, requiring browser fallback — but the PDFs themselves downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (Form 131) is a clean, single-page, digitally-created PDF — not a scan. It has a proper text layer enabling screen reader access and text search. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring handwriting after printing. The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (demographics → direction of release → purpose → date range → record types → format → consent → signature) and uses reasonable visual hierarchy with checkboxes and section groupings. Language is a blend of plain English and necessary legal terminology — the consent bullets are clearly written, though the sensitive information disclosure section is dense.

The form offers an unusually good set of **four delivery format options**: paper copies, CD, USB flash drive, and encrypted email — with a thoughtful security disclosure about email risks.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required.**
- **No fees disclosed** — the form says nothing about costs.
- **Hold harmless clause** is a red flag: "The facility is hereby released and discharged of any liability, and I will hold the facility harmless for complying with this authorization." HIPAA does not permit conditioning access on signing a liability release.
- **90-day authorization expiration** is relatively short but within norms.
- **Photo ID verification** on the English form implies in-person submission, though the website lists fax as an option.
- **No response time commitment** stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — uncommon among community hospitals in this study.
- **Multiple request channels** (PDF, Swellbox portal, patient portal, fax, phone).
- **Encrypted email delivery** option with proactive security disclosure.
- **"Myself" listed first** in the recipient field — a subtle but meaningful patient-centric design choice.

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must use a generic authorization form.
- **Non-fillable PDF** — requires printing and handwriting.
- **Spanish form is outdated** (05/2017 vs. 08/2018 English) with missing content (no Social Security/Disability purpose, no Photo ID section).
- **Hold harmless clause** is potentially noncompliant for patient access requests.
- **Sensitive information limitation** is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to exercise it.

## Overall Assessment

Maury Regional Health provides an accessible, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process with commendable multilingual support and multiple submission channels. The main shortcomings are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, a non-fillable PDF form, and a potentially problematic liability waiver. The availability of the Swellbox online portal partially compensates for the PDF's limitations, and the overall experience is adequate — a patient can successfully request their own records without undue difficulty, though the process could be more patient-centric.

# Desert Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Regional Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Palm Springs, CA, operated by Desert Care Network, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare. Two forms were found: an English-language ROI authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are 2-page digitally created PDFs available from a dedicated medical records page on the Desert Care Network website.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

Desert Regional does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization for the Release of Health Information" and are structured as third-party disclosure authorizations — the patient authorizes Desert Regional to release records *to* a named recipient. A patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient, an awkward workaround that conflates the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) with the authorization framework of § 164.508. There is no separate form, section, or instructions addressing patient self-access as a distinct use case.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient/patient representative" as one option, but "Continuation of Care" appears as the default/first option, further underscoring the form's third-party orientation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A direct `filetype:pdf` search yielded nothing, but a site-specific search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page at `/patients/request-medical-records`. That page is well-organized, with per-hospital download links in both English and Spanish. Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic downloads, requiring browser-based workarounds — though a patient using a standard browser would not encounter this. Overall, the form is roughly 2–3 clicks from the homepage via a logical navigation path.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is digitally authored with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores requiring print-and-handwrite. This is a significant missed opportunity given the digital-native construction. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, recipient info, 12 record-type checkboxes, date range, purpose, and delivery method. The layout is logical and readable, following a clear top-to-bottom sequence. Language tilts toward legal/administrative but is not impenetrably dense; the rights section uses standard HIPAA authorization language with four-exception conditional clauses that could benefit from plain-language explanation.

Delivery method options include patient pickup, mail, fax, and email — the inclusion of email is a positive differentiator. The form header provides phone, fax, and email contact for the HIM department, giving patients multiple submission channels.

## Spanish Translation Quality

The Spanish form (form-2.pdf) mirrors the English version in structure and content, but suffers from **pervasive typographical errors** — at least 9 distinct misspellings including "APCIENTE" (PACIENTE), "cofidencialidad" (confidencialidad), and "DIVILGACIÓN" (DIVULGACIÓN). More consequentially, the Spanish form **omits the delivery method section** entirely, meaning Spanish-speaking patients cannot indicate how they want to receive their records. The fax number in the Spanish header also appears truncated. These errors suggest the translation was not professionally reviewed and create a meaningful disparity in service quality for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no mandatory in-person submission, and no explicit fee requirements. Revocation rights and authorization expiration are clearly stated. However, the form says nothing about fees — neither disclosing them nor stating they don't apply for patient access. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, and the rights section covers only authorization-related rights (voluntariness, revocation). There is no mention of electronic health information export or the patient's right to receive records in their requested format.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** is meaningful for the Coachella Valley's large Spanish-speaking population
- **Dedicated medical records page** with clear, per-hospital download links
- **Email as a delivery option** is more progressive than many ROI forms
- **Multiple HIM contact channels** (phone, fax, email) on the form header

## Overall Assessment

Desert Regional Medical Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The primary pathway is a generic third-party release form with no differentiation for patient self-access — a common but patient-unfriendly pattern. The form is reasonably well-organized and findable, but the lack of fillable fields and the poor quality of the Spanish translation diminish the overall experience. A patient can submit via fax or email (adequate electronic pathways), but must first print and handwrite the form. The organization earns credit for bilingual availability and a clear website presence, but falls short on patient-centeredness and digital accessibility.

# Alabama Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Alabama Medical Group, P.C. is an independent, for-profit, multi-specialty physician practice based in Mobile, Alabama. The organization maintains a well-organized website with a dedicated Patient Resources section, including a clearly labeled "Request Medical Records" page. Two forms were found and evaluated: a general-purpose "Request for Release of Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a narrow "Permission to Give Medical Information" form (form-2.pdf) for authorizing family phone access. Only form-1 is relevant for a patient seeking their own records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Third-Party Authorization

Alabama Medical Group does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-1, a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form titled "Request for Release of Information." The form is structured around "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" fields — language designed for inter-provider and third-party transfers, not for a patient requesting their own records. A patient would need to place their own name and address in the "Release To" field, which is workable but not intuitive.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access anywhere on the form. The form frames the entire interaction as consent-to-release rather than as an exercise of a legal right. The purpose checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Evaluation & Treatment, Other) further confirm this is designed for third-party scenarios — a patient requesting their own records would likely select "Other" and write in an explanation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The website is well-organized with a clear path: Patient Resources → Medical Records → Request Medical Records. The form is linked directly from that page as a PDF download. The same form also appears on the "Other Patient Forms" page. No bot blocking, no browser fallback needed, and no significant difficulties were encountered. The duplicate hosting (identical file at two URLs uploaded one month apart) is a minor organizational issue but does not impair access.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but **no fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects patient name (including maiden name), date of birth, Social Security Number, medical record number, recipient/source information with address/phone/fax, purpose, type of information (free-text), sensitive information consent, and multiple signature lines. The field count is approximately 15–18 data points.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow and fits on one page, though this density makes it somewhat cramped. Language is a mix of plain English for identification fields and standard legal boilerplate for the authorization terms. The example prompt for specifying record type — "(Example: Office Notes, Labs, In-Office Testing, all records)" — is a helpful touch. The dual signature block for sensitive information consent (specifically permitting vs. specifically not permitting) gives patients clear control.

However, the form lacks submission instructions — no mailing address, fax number, or email address is printed on it. A patient who downloads the PDF would not know how to return it without navigating back to the website or calling the office. There is also no date range field, no delivery format options, and no mention of electronic delivery.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests a Social Security Number as a standard field, which is unnecessary for a medical records request and creates an identity theft risk. The **employee/witness signature line** at the bottom is ambiguous — if required, it would effectively mandate in-person submission, a significant barrier not required by HIPAA. **No fees are mentioned** on the form, which leaves uncertainty about costs. **No response time** is stated.

The form was uploaded in February 2018 and has apparently not been updated since, suggesting the organization has not revisited its records request process in approximately eight years.

## Notable Strengths

- Easy findability with clear website navigation
- Concise one-page form
- Helpful example text for record type specification
- Clean sensitive information consent design with explicit opt-in/opt-out

## Overall Assessment

Alabama Medical Group provides a **functional but dated** records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it funnels patients through a generic third-party release authorization with no acknowledgment of patient access rights. The flat PDF with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no electronic submission pathway creates a primarily paper-based workflow. The SSN collection and ambiguous witness requirement are concerning. This is a practice that has not modernized its records access process to reflect current patient expectations or HIPAA right-of-access principles.

# Mercy General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy General Hospital, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Sacramento, CA, provides patients with a reasonably accessible but structurally fragmented records request process. Three forms were found: a general third-party authorization (form-1), a medical group patient access form (form-2), and a hospital patient access form (form-3). The organization correctly separates patient self-access from third-party release — a meaningful positive — but splits patient access across two entities (hospital vs. medical group), requiring patients to navigate dual tracks.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Mercy General Hospital does differentiate individual access from third-party release. Both form-2 and form-3 are titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and explicitly state they will not result in disclosure to anyone other than the patient or their representative. The third-party authorization (form-1) is a clearly separate document. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations funnel all requests through a single generic HIPAA authorization form.

However, the dual-track structure (hospital form vs. medical group form) creates confusion. A patient who received both inpatient and outpatient care at Mercy General would need to submit two different forms to two different departments. The website does not provide clear guidance on which form to use, and the hospital vs. medical group distinction is opaque to most patients.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. All three were accessible via web search and linked from the Dignity Health Sacramento medical records page. One URL from search results returned a 404, suggesting some form reorganization over time, but current links worked. The forms' filenames are reasonably descriptive. Contact information (phone, fax, email) is provided on the medical group form, making it easy for patients to ask questions.

## Form Document Quality

The primary hospital patient access form (form-3) is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a significant gap, especially since the companion third-party authorization (form-1) has 42 fillable fields, demonstrating the organization has the capability to produce interactive PDFs. The medical group form (form-2) also has zero fillable fields. Both patient access forms are print-and-fill documents that were designed for in-person clinical workflows and posted online as an afterthought.

Form-3's text layer suffers from severe font encoding corruption — extracted text contains garbled characters (e.g., "3DWLHQW ,GHQWL¿FDWLRQ" for "Patient Identification"), which likely renders the form inaccessible to screen readers.

The layout of both patient access forms is logical with lettered sections, clear record-type checkboxes, and multiple delivery format options (Paper, USB Drive, CD, Secure Email, Unsecured Email for form-3; mail, pickup, email, flash drive, fax for form-2). Language is mostly plain, though some legalistic phrasing appears in the sensitive records sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flags relate to physician gatekeeping of patient access:

- **Physician veto mechanism**: Form-3 includes a "NOTIFICATION TO DOCTOR" section that actively solicits physician objections to releasing records, without informing the patient of their right to appeal a denial.
- **Physician approval for HIV and psychiatric records**: Both patient access forms require physician/caregiver approval before releasing HIV test results or psychiatric records to the patient — a requirement that likely conflicts with HIPAA's right of access, which generally does not condition patient access on provider approval.
- **ID verification contradiction**: Form-2 demands "PICTURE I.D. MUST BE PRESENTED" while simultaneously offering mail, email, and fax submission — contradictory requirements.

Fee disclosure is vague on both forms ("fees may apply") without specifying amounts. Form-3 references an "attached price list" that is not included in the PDF. Neither form states a response timeline, and neither includes a patient rights section (unlike the third-party authorization form, which does).

## Strengths

- Clear separation of patient access from third-party release, with explicit cross-references between forms
- Multiple electronic delivery options including USB drive, CD, secure and unsecured email
- Inspect-only option on form-2 (no copying fees)
- Direct contact information (phone, fax, email) prominently displayed
- Multi-facility coverage across six Dignity Health Sacramento hospitals

## Overall Assessment

Mercy General Hospital demonstrates good intent in creating dedicated patient access forms separate from third-party authorizations, and offers genuinely flexible delivery options. However, the execution falls short: non-fillable PDFs, encoding accessibility issues, physician gatekeeping provisions, and a confusing dual-track structure undermine patient-centeredness. The organization invests more technical effort in the third-party release form (42 fillable fields) than in its patient access forms (zero fillable fields each), suggesting that patient self-access is not the priority workflow. A patient can ultimately navigate the process, but must contend with printing forms, unclear fee structures, and potentially inappropriate physician approval requirements.

# St. Charles Redmond — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

St. Charles Redmond is part of the St. Charles Health System, a nonprofit regional system operating four hospitals across Central Oregon (Bend, Redmond, Madras, Prineville). The system uses a single, unified ROI authorization form across all locations — there is no Redmond-specific form. Four PDF documents were retrieved: a legacy 2016 non-fillable version (form-1), a superseded 2022 fillable version (form-2), the current 2025 English fillable version (form-3), and the current 2025 Spanish fillable version (form-4). The primary form for assessment is **form-3.pdf**, the current English authorization form linked from the website.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

St. Charles does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All records requests — whether a patient seeking their own records or a third party requesting disclosure — are routed through the same "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. A patient requesting their own records checks "Personal" under the purpose field, but the form's From/To structure, designed to handle bidirectional provider-to-provider transfers, is unintuitive for simple self-access. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and the form uses an authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than an access-request framework — a meaningful distinction that affects fee limits and processing timelines.

The website's release-of-information page does distinguish between self-requests and third-party requests in its instructions, and notes that patients can alternatively use **MyChart** for records from April 7, 2018 onward. This patient portal pathway offers a fully digital alternative, though it is limited to records after the system's EHR transition date.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the St. Charles ROI page, which is clearly linked under the Patients section. Both English and Spanish PDF links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor issue was that legacy form URLs remain accessible on the server, meaning a search engine could direct patients to an outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a well-constructed 2-page fillable PDF with **65 interactive fields** covering all data-entry points. This is a genuinely usable digital document — patients can type their responses on-screen. The form uses a numbered section system (1–10) with matching instructions at the bottom of each page, a thoughtful design pattern. Record-type options are granular, with parenthetical descriptions explaining what each category includes. Plain-language parentheticals gloss legal concepts (e.g., "revoke (take back or change my mind about)").

However, the layout is dense, and the dual From/To sections (3 and 4) have **identical instruction text**, creating confusion about which section applies to whom. The CORA radiology contact information adds operational clutter. The form collects approximately 15–20 patient-facing fields (demographics, purpose, locations, record types, date range, sensitive-records initials, format/delivery, and signature).

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the **wet-ink signature requirement** — the form explicitly states "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED," preventing electronic signatures and forcing patients to print the form after filling it digitally. The submission pathway then requires faxing (HIM fax number is listed in the footer: 541-706-6352) or mailing to the Bend HIM office. Fax submission is available, satisfying the electronic submission threshold, but the print-sign-fax workflow is cumbersome.

Fees are mentioned twice ("Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations") but never quantified, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. No fee schedule is referenced. The form does not distinguish between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's cost-based limits) and third-party release fees.

No notarization is required. A photo ID check appears in the office-use section but is not presented as a patient-facing barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Full Spanish translation (form-4) with 65 fillable fields — genuinely uncommon and meaningful for Central Oregon's community.
- **Iterative improvement**: The progression from flat PDF (2016) to 64-field fillable (2022) to 65-field fillable (2025) shows active form maintenance.
- **System-wide form with location checkboxes**: Simplifies multi-location requests within the St. Charles system.
- **MyChart alternative**: Provides a fully digital pathway for post-2018 records.

## Overall Assessment

St. Charles Redmond provides a competent but undifferentiated records-request process. The form itself is technically well-made — fillable, bilingual, well-organized — but it funnels patients through a generic authorization framework that wasn't designed for individual access. The wet-ink signature requirement undermines the otherwise digital-friendly form design, and the lack of fee transparency or Right of Access language represents missed opportunities. The MyChart alternative partially compensates but doesn't cover the full record history. Overall, this is a **C-grade** experience: functional and findable, but not patient-centered.

# ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

ENT & Allergy Associates is a large for-profit physician practice with 80+ offices across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Despite its size, the organization provides one of the poorest records-request experiences in this study. The sole ROI form is a 17-year-old Microsoft Word document buried on the website with no visible link, no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no pathway designed for patients requesting their own records.

## Forms & Pathways

Two documents were retrieved:

1. **form-1.pdf** (the ROI form): "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA" — a 2-page generic third-party release authorization. Originally a `.doc` file created in 2009, converted to PDF for this study. This is the only records-release mechanism available.
2. **form-2.pdf** (not an ROI form): "Patient Acknowledgment Form – Allergy Form Completion Fee" — a $25 fee acknowledgment for physician form completion (school/activity clearance). Found in the footer under the misleading label "Allergy Authorization Form."

There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The only pathway is downloading a Word document and figuring out independently how to submit it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for releasing records to a named third party. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in Item 8 ("Name and address of person(s) or category of person to whom this information will be sent"), which is unintuitive and not explained anywhere. The form contains no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights statement specific to individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient may simply want to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was exceptionally difficult. The website has no "Patient Forms," "Medical Records," or "Request Your Records" section. The FAQ mentions medical records only in the context of retention policies. The footer link labeled "Allergy Authorization Form" leads to the fee acknowledgment (form-2), not the ROI form. The actual ROI form exists at an orphaned URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) not linked from any navigable page — it was only discoverable through a targeted `filetype:doc` web search. A patient browsing the website would have no path to this form.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a Word `.doc` file with zero fillable fields, requiring patients to either print and handwrite or type into the Word template. The layout uses a numbered list but lacks visual hierarchy — no section headers, minimal bold, and no section dividers. Language is moderately dense legalese with constructions like "except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization." Item 6 is entirely in ALL-CAPS and contains a typo ("THEN" instead of "THE"). The form collects approximately 12–15 pieces of information, including the patient's Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection point that creates a privacy risk.

## Barriers & Red Flags

- **No submission instructions whatsoever.** The form provides no address, fax number, email, or portal link. A patient who manages to find and complete it has no guidance on how to return it.
- **SSN requested.** Unnecessary for identity verification in records requests and a data security risk.
- **Severely outdated.** Last modified January 2009 — predates the HITECH Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the ONC Information Blocking Rule.
- **Confusing Item 6.** The ALL-CAPS restriction on discussing health information could be read to limit the provider's ability to discuss records even with the patient themselves.

## Bright Spots

- **Proper handling of sensitive categories.** The form correctly requires separate initialing for HIV, substance abuse, and mental health records, with anti-redisclosure language and civil rights contact information per NY/NJ state law.
- **Anti-conditioning statement.** Item 4 clearly states treatment and benefits will not be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

ENT & Allergy Associates presents a deeply patient-unfriendly records request experience. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, an outdated Word document format, zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no patient-access-specific pathway means that a patient attempting to request their records online would face barriers at every step. For a practice of this size and market presence, this represents a significant gap in patient-centered service. **Grade: D.**

# Synthesis: Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center

## Overview

Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Far Rockaway, NY. Three documents were found on the organization's website: the primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a bilingual patient exit survey (form-2), and a general HIPAA consent/NPP acknowledgment form (form-3). Only form-1 functions as an actual records request authorization.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Addabbo does not offer a pathway designed specifically for patient self-access. The sole records request mechanism is **OCA Official Form No. 960**, a New York State standard "Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA." This is a general-purpose third-party authorization form — originally designed for litigation — that patients must repurpose when requesting their own records. The form includes "At request of individual" as one checkbox among several reasons for release, but it does not distinguish between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party seeking records. The instruction page explicitly states the form was designed for "release of health information needed for litigation in New York State courts" and "can, however, be used more broadly."

The form does not reference the patient's right to receive their own records, does not offer format or delivery options (electronic, paper, CD), and does not mention a patient portal. It collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for patient self-access and creates privacy risk.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. The organization's website has a dedicated Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`) accessible through the "For Patients" navigation menu. However, the forms are hosted on a third-party platform (Practice Builders / `pbformsonline.com`) via a JavaScript-based PDF viewer, requiring browser DevTools inspection to obtain the actual PDF download URL. A patient could fill the form within the embedded viewer, but downloading for offline completion requires technical sophistication.

A potential confusion point: the Patient Forms page labels form-3 as "HIPAA Consent to Release Information," which could mislead patients into downloading a registration consent form instead of the actual ROI authorization.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **fillable PDF** with 25 interactive fields, though none have accessible name attributes (degrading screen reader usability). The form is 2 pages — one page of authorization content and one page of litigation-context instructions. This is appropriately concise.

The form's structure front-loads six numbered legal disclosures (HIV redisclosure warnings, revocation rights, voluntariness) before any patient-fillable fields, creating a dense, legalistic opening. The language throughout is complex — written for attorneys, not patients. Item 6's all-caps restriction on discussing health information "WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SPECIFIED IN ITEM 9(b)" is confusing in a non-litigation context.

A notable bright spot: Addabbo added a **typed-signature acceptance clause**, allowing patients to complete and sign the form digitally without printing. This is a meaningful accommodation for remote submission. The form also provides a clear enumeration of what "entire medical record" includes and granular opt-in initialing for sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug treatment, mental health, HIV).

## Barriers

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number — unnecessary for patient self-access and a privacy risk.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. While this avoids imposing excessive fees, it also doesn't inform patients of their cost-limited rights.
- **No submission method specified on form**: The form itself does not indicate how to submit. The website context and Practice Builders platform provide some guidance, but submission via fax or in-person delivery appears to be expected.
- **Exit survey co-location**: The "We're Listening" exit survey (form-2) is posted alongside the ROI form on the Medical Records page, framing all records requests as patient transfers. If presented as a companion requirement, this could function as an implicit barrier. The survey contains pervasive Spanish translation errors.

## Bright Spots

- Typed-signature acceptance removes the print-sign-scan barrier
- Explicit enumeration of medical record contents gives patients clarity
- Granular sensitive-information opt-in via initialing
- Bilingual exit survey (despite translation quality issues) reflects community awareness
- Dedicated Medical Records page with direct link to the ROI form

## Overall Assessment

Addabbo provides a functional but imperfect pathway for patient records access. The organization relies on a state-standard litigation authorization form rather than creating a patient-centered access process. The form is fillable with typed-signature support — a meaningful digital accommodation — but the legalistic language, SSN collection, litigation framing, and lack of patient access rights language place the experience squarely in "adequate but not designed for you" territory. The retrieval experience is reasonable, though the third-party form hosting and confusingly labeled companion documents create unnecessary friction.

# Cone Health — Organizational Synthesis

## Overview

Cone Health is a nonprofit regional health system based in Greensboro, NC, operating multiple hospitals and the Cone Health Medical Group (CHMG) physician practices. Four documents were found related to medical records requests: a primary English HIPAA Authorization form (form-1), its Spanish translation (form-2), a Request for Amendment form (form-3, not an ROI form), and a separate CHMG-specific ROI form (form-4) discovered only through web search. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a generic HIPAA authorization downloaded from the Medical Records page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Differentiation

Cone Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "HIPAA Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-requests and third-party releases. The only differentiation is a checkbox in the Purpose section: "☐ Patient Request ☐ Legal ☐ Other." A patient requesting their own records must still complete recipient fields (name, address, fax, email) designed for third-party disclosures — effectively naming themselves as the recipient of their own information. The form never references the HIPAA Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or frames the interaction as a patient exercising a legal right. Adding to the confusion, CHMG patients need a separate form (form-4) that isn't linked from the main website, and no guidance explains which form applies to which patient.

## Retrieval Experience

The primary form was **easy to find** — it is linked directly from a well-organized Medical Records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records/`. However, the site employs bot protection that blocks standard HTTP requests, requiring browser-like headers or a real browser for downloads. The CHMG form (form-4) was only discoverable via web search, not through website navigation — a notable findability gap for medical group patients.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields despite being a digitally-produced document (not a scan). All 20+ fields must be completed by hand after printing. This is especially notable because the CHMG form (form-4) includes 42 fillable fields, demonstrating the organization has the capability. The form is organized into 6 numbered sections with a clear logical flow (patient identification → recipient → purpose → facility → date range → information type → delivery method → rights/signature). However, the language is heavily administrative/legal: the Patient Rights section consists of 8 dense paragraphs, and information-type checkboxes use clinical terminology ("History and Physical," "Consultation Reports," "Operative Notes") that most patients would not understand.

The form offers 6 delivery methods including email — a bright spot. But critically, the form provides **no submission instructions** — no address, fax number, email, or guidance on where to send the completed authorization. The only address appears in the revocation clause. A patient must independently determine how to submit.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee charge for reproduction of medical records" with no amounts or reference to HIPAA fee limits. The form bundles authorization for all sensitive categories (reproductive health, mental health, STDs, genetic testing, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS) with no opt-out mechanism — a patient requesting a simple lab result must authorize disclosure of all sensitive information. The "Office Use Only" section requiring a Driver's License number implies in-person identity verification may be expected. The CHMG form compounds these issues with an embedded liability waiver ("hereby released from any legal responsibility or liability") that is not standard HIPAA language and may chill patient access rights.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** (form-2), professionally translated and linked alongside the English version
- **Email delivery option** offered with transparent security disclaimer
- **Granular record-type selection** with 18+ checkboxes including behavioral health subcategories
- **Recently updated** (December 2024), suggesting active form maintenance
- **Amendment form published** alongside ROI forms, appropriately serving the related HIPAA right

## Overall Assessment

Cone Health provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form that was designed primarily for third-party disclosures, with no dedicated pathway for individual access. The primary form's lack of fillable fields, absent submission instructions, bundled sensitive-category consent, and split between hospital and CHMG forms create a process that works but requires persistence and guesswork from patients. The Spanish translation and email delivery option are genuine bright spots, but they don't compensate for the fundamental design choices that make this a C-level experience.

# UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, part of the UCHealth system in Aurora, Colorado, provides a solid pathway for patients requesting their own medical records. The organization's medical records page is well-organized, directly links to the current authorization form, and offers an online request portal (MRO Express) as an alternative. Four PDFs were downloaded during retrieval, but only two are genuinely relevant: the current system-wide authorization form (form-4) and an older 2017-era predecessor (form-1). A third form (form-2) is a legacy inter-facility transfer document, and the fourth (form-3) belongs to an entirely different organization — UC Health Cincinnati — retrieved due to domain confusion between uchealth.org (Colorado) and uchealth.com (Cincinnati).

## Access Pathway: Generic Form with Strong Patient Accommodation

UCHealth does not offer a dedicated patient-access-only form. The current form (form-4, document #HIM19000.1025, revised October 2025) is a generic "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it accommodates patient self-access unusually well. The form includes an explicit "If released to self, select method of release" section with four delivery options: email, My Health Connection (patient portal), mail, and PowerShare (for radiology images). The fee schedule is split clearly between patient access (free via portal, free paper up to 100 pages, first radiology disc free) and third-party recipients (retrieval fee plus per-page charges). This dual fee structure is a standout practice — few organizations make this distinction so transparently on the form itself.

The organization also offers MRO Express, an online request portal, as an alternative to the downloadable PDF. This portal provides a fully digital pathway, though our evaluation focused on the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. UCHealth's medical records page (`uchealth.org/access-my-health-connection/medical-records-uchealth/`) was reachable within 1–2 clicks from the main website and clearly presented the download link, online portal option, and location-specific contact information. The only complication was domain confusion: a web search returned a form from UC Health Cincinnati (uchealth.com), which could mislead patients searching generically for "UCHealth" forms. Two older forms (2017 and 2018 vintages) also remain publicly hosted at their original URLs with no indication they are superseded, creating a minor stale-link hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4) is a single-page, digitally generated PDF with a clean text layer — not a scan. Despite its digital-native construction, it has **zero fillable form fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. This is a notable gap: the older form-2 (a legacy inter-facility document) actually had 54 fillable fields, demonstrating that UCHealth has the technical capacity for interactive PDFs but did not apply it to the current form.

The layout is logical — flowing from facility selection through patient demographics, purpose, recipient, date range, record types, disclosures, fees, and signature — but extremely dense. Approximately 28 record-type checkboxes, a full fee schedule, six numbered disclosure statements, a reproductive healthcare warning, and a confidentiality notice are all compressed onto a single page. The form helpfully defines "Visit record" vs. "Visit summary" in parenthetical notes, aiding patient comprehension. Language across the disclosures is plain and accessible, covering right to revoke, voluntary nature, no conditioning on treatment, and re-disclosure risks. The form does not include submission instructions (no address, fax number, or email for where to send it), though this information is presumably on the medical records web page.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

UCHealth imposes no significant barriers: no notarization, no SSN request (a problem on the older form-2, now corrected), no mandatory in-person submission, and no conditioning of treatment on signing. The patient fee structure — free portal delivery and free paper up to 100 pages — is among the most generous observed. A notable bright spot is the reproductive healthcare warning (item 6), alerting patients that released reproductive health information could be used in litigation — a post-*Dobbs* addition reflecting emerging privacy concerns. Sensitive record categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, genetic, sickle cell, reproductive health) each require separate patient consent, providing granular control.

The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (requiring print-and-fill), the absence of submission instructions on the form itself, and the failure to state a processing time commitment (the older form-1 promised 10 business days). The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Overall Assessment

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital earns a solid **B** grade. The organization makes its form easy to find, provides an online portal alternative, clearly accommodates patient self-access with separate delivery options and fee structures, and maintains strong compliance posture. The main shortcomings are the non-fillable PDF format and the dense single-page design. With fillable fields and submission instructions added to the form, this would approach best-in-class.

# Phelps Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, NY is a community hospital within the Northwell Health system. It uses Northwell's system-wide forms for medical records requests, hosted at the parent system's medical records page (northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records). Six documents were retrieved in total: two core forms (patient access and third-party authorization), a Spanish bilingual authorization form, two companion instruction guides, and a duplicate non-fillable version of the authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

Northwell Health stands out by clearly differentiating patient self-access from third-party release. The medical records page has two distinct sections: "Request for Access to Health Information" (for patients requesting their own records) and "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (for directing records to third parties). The patient access form (form-2) is explicitly titled "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative" and opens by citing HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524) — framing the request as an exercise of patient rights rather than a permission grant. A "To me" checkbox in Section 2 makes the self-access pathway concrete. This separation is a genuine best practice that many health systems fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches for "Phelps Hospital" combined with medical records terms immediately surfaced the Northwell Health medical records page. The page is well-organized with descriptive URLs and clear section headings. The main friction is that Phelps Hospital's own sub-site (phelps.northwell.edu) does not host forms directly — patients must navigate to the parent system's website, which is a minor extra step but the connection is clear from the Northwell branding.

## Form Document Quality

The primary patient access form (form-2) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with 28 fillable interactive fields. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence: patient demographics, facility releasing records, recipient (with "To me" option), delivery manner and format, requested health information scope, substance use/HIV section, and signature. The delivery options grid is particularly well-designed, pairing delivery manner (mail, pickup, email, fax) with format (paper, USB, CD, secure/unsecure email) in a structured table. Scope options include medical record abstract, date-range records, entire record, lab results, radiology, itemized bills, and a free-text "Other" field — giving patients granular control.

The language is reasonably plain, with parenthetical glosses like "(From Who)" and "(To Who)" alongside formal labels. The substance use disorder section (Section 5) is denser legal text, but it's conditionally required — only for patients requesting those specific record types. A companion instruction document (form-6) provides step-by-step annotated examples with sample data, significantly lowering the completion barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization is required. The witness signature line is present but not explicitly mandatory. No fees are mentioned. No in-person submission is required. These are all positives.

The most significant gap is the absence of submission instructions on the form itself — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link. A patient who fills out the form has no guidance on where to send it. Fax submission is presumably available as an industry standard for Northwell facilities, but the patient must find this information independently.

A notable equity concern: the website has a bug where both the "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)" links point to the same URL, which contains only the Spanish authorization (third-party) form. There is no Spanish-language version of the patient access form despite the website appearing to offer one. This effectively denies Spanish-speaking patients access to the correct form for exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

## Notable Strengths

The strongest features of Northwell's approach for Phelps Hospital patients are: (1) the dedicated patient access form with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation, (2) companion instruction documents for both forms with annotated visual examples, (3) rich delivery format options including secure email, USB, CD, and fax, (4) fully fillable interactive PDFs for digital completion, and (5) plain-language accessibility touches throughout. The dual-form architecture — with separate patient access and third-party release pathways — represents a structural investment in patient-centered design.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Hospital, through its parent Northwell Health system, provides an above-average patient records request experience. The dedicated patient access pathway — with its explicit HIPAA § 164.524 framing, separate form architecture, and companion instruction materials — represents a genuinely patient-centered design that earns top marks for patient-centeredness. The fillable digital forms and comprehensive delivery options round out a strong offering. The main weaknesses — missing submission instructions on the form and the broken Spanish form links — are addressable defects rather than structural problems. This is a solid B-grade experience overall (4.25/5.0): clearly competent and patient-aware, with room for improvement in closing operational gaps.

# Lincoln Hospital (Davenport, WA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lincoln Hospital, a small government-owned critical access hospital in rural eastern Washington, publishes two ROI forms on its Health Records page: a **clinics version** (form-1.pdf) for records held at North Basin Medical Clinics and a **hospital version** (form-2.pdf) for hospital records. Both are titled "Authorization for Release of Health Care Information and Records" and share nearly identical structure and legal boilerplate. The forms are reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients and Visitors → Health Records), making them reasonably easy to find.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Neither form is a dedicated patient access request form. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information — the page 1 structure asks patients to specify a recipient for records, with fields for the recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. Page 2 of each form includes an "ACCESS REQUEST" section that acknowledges the patient's right to inspect and obtain copies of their own records, making the forms technically dual-purpose. However, a patient requesting their own records receives no clear guidance on how to fill out the third-party-oriented page 1 — should they list themselves as the recipient? The form doesn't say. The "At the request of the Patient" purpose checkbox and "Given to Patient" delivery option exist but are not prominently featured as a distinct pathway.

## Form Document Quality

The hospital form (form-2.pdf) is the technically superior document: it has a full text layer (7,364 characters extractable), making it screen-reader accessible and searchable. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. The clinics form (form-1.pdf) is worse: a scanned image of a paper document with no extractable text whatsoever, rendering it completely inaccessible to assistive technology.

Both forms are 2 pages and reasonably organized. Page 1 uses labeled sections (Types of Information, Purpose, Revocation, Re-Disclosure, No Conditions, Time Frame, Consent of Minor) with clear visual hierarchy. The language mixes plain English with necessary legal terminology; sections like the "No Conditions" statement are clear, while the sensitive-information preamble is dense legalese. The hospital form's "OFFICE USE" section appears near patient-facing fields without clear labeling, potentially confusing patients about what they need to fill out.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were found through web search and confirmed on the hospital website. The Health Records page returned a 403 error to automated fetch tools (likely bot blocking), requiring browser access, but loaded normally in a standard browser. One alternate URL for the clinics form returned HTTP 400, suggesting stale links. Overall findability was good — a patient navigating the website would locate these forms without difficulty.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant concern is the **fee structure**. The clinics form cites Washington's WAC 246-08-400 fee schedule ($26.00 search/base fee, $1.17/page for first 30 pages, $0.88/page thereafter plus tax) — fees designed for third-party record duplication that likely exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests. Worse, this fee schedule references dates of September 2017 through June 2019, making it nearly seven years expired. The hospital form takes a different approach: its fee field reads "$______ per page" with the amount left blank — unhelpful for patients trying to anticipate costs.

The clinics form requires patients to attach a copy of photo identification, which goes beyond HIPAA requirements and creates an additional burden. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both forms correctly state a 30-day response time (60 days for off-site records) with one possible 30-day extension, aligning with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

The clinics form offers electronic delivery options — "MyChart Secure Patient Portal, CD, USB Flash Drive (provided by patient)" — a notably progressive feature for a small rural critical access hospital. The "Most recent two (2) years" date range shortcut with specific clinical examples (colonoscopy, mammogram, DEXA, diabetic exams) is patient-friendly. Both forms include an explicit "No Conditions" statement and detailed minor consent provisions aligned with Washington State law.

## Overall Assessment

Lincoln Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and include some thoughtful patient-facing features (electronic delivery options, clinical shortcuts), but fundamental issues undermine the experience: no fillable fields on either form, a generic third-party authorization structure that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, potentially excessive fees, and one form that is an image-only scan. The organization deserves credit for acknowledging patient access rights on page 2 of each form but falls short of providing a clear, patient-centric access pathway.

# Myrtue Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Myrtue Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Harlan, Iowa. The organization posts its medical records forms on a dedicated "Authorization + Release Forms" page under the Patients + Visitors section of its website. Two English-language forms were retrieved, along with references to their Spanish translations:

- **form-1.pdf** — "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (the primary ROI form)
- **form-2.pdf** — "Consent for Disclosure" (permission for verbal communication with designated individuals)

Form-1 is the document a patient would use to request copies of their own medical records. Form-2 serves a different purpose — authorizing the facility to discuss a patient's care by phone with family members or caregivers — and is not relevant to the patient self-access use case.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

Myrtue Medical Center does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party seeking authorization for release. Form-1 is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form with a bidirectional "From / To" layout. A patient requesting their own records must check Myrtue in the "From" column and write their own name and address in the "To" column's "Other" field. This works, but the form was clearly designed with third-party release as the primary use case — there is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no streamlined self-request pathway, and no language acknowledging that patients have a legal right to their records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A site-scoped web search returned direct PDF links, and the organization's website provides a clearly labeled forms page reachable within two clicks from the homepage. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or login requirements were encountered. The PDF filenames are descriptive and include language and revision date. The form header includes complete HIM department contact information (phone, fax, and email), giving patients clear channels for questions and submission.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally designed PDF — concise and logically organized with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, from/to routing, record type selection, purpose, delivery method, legal disclosures, and signature. The language is mostly plain, with formal phrasing limited to the legal disclosures at the bottom. Record type options are granular, with appropriate handling of substance use disorder records under 42 CFR Part 2.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being designed in publishing software with 10 fonts and an embedded logo. All checkboxes and text blanks are static graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a missed opportunity — the June 2025 revision could have added interactive form elements with minimal effort.

## Submission and Delivery Options

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: MyChart Portal, mail, encrypted email, and in-person pickup. The inclusion of MyChart Portal and encrypted email is a genuine bright spot for a small rural facility. For form submission, the header lists fax (712-755-2640) and email (medicalrecords@myrtuemedical.org), meaning a patient can submit the completed form electronically. This meets the baseline for adequate electronic access.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required — only the patient or authorized representative signature. Fees are disclosed as subject to "reproduction fees in accordance with federal/state regulations," but no specific amounts are provided, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. The form includes required HIPAA authorization disclosures: right to revoke, no-conditioning statement, re-disclosure warning, and a one-year maximum expiration. However, because the form frames patient access as a § 164.508 authorization rather than a § 164.524 access request, patients may not understand that different fee rules and timelines apply to their own records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish translations available** for both forms — commendable for a small rural Iowa facility
- **MyChart Portal and encrypted email** as delivery options signal a digital-forward approach
- **Substance use disorder carve-out** with 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language reflects careful compliance
- **Recent revision** (June 2025) suggests active form maintenance
- **Single-page design** minimizes patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Myrtue Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with some genuinely progressive features (portal delivery, encrypted email, bilingual availability). However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields, and the generic authorization framing place it squarely in the middle tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center (VGMHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Hillsboro, Oregon, serving a predominantly Latino patient population. The organization publishes four Release of Information–related documents on its website: the main HIPAA ROI authorization form in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), plus a Release of Verbal Health Information form in English (form-3) and Spanish (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records is form-1 (or form-2 for Spanish speakers).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

VGMHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form or pathway. A patient wanting their own records must use the same general-purpose HIPAA Release of Information form designed for inter-provider exchanges and third-party releases. The form asks the patient to choose a direction ("Get information," "Give information," or "Get and give information") and specify a recipient provider/facility — a workflow that doesn't map cleanly to "I want a copy of my own records."

A partial mitigation exists: the form includes "For my own use" as a purpose checkbox alongside "Coordination of care" and "Insurance/Legal." This acknowledges patient self-access as a valid use case, but the patient still must navigate a form structured around bilateral information exchange rather than simple record retrieval. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal–based records request option visible on the website.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search immediately returned direct links to the English ROI form, and the organization's Patient Forms page (https://virginiagarcia.org/get-care/patient-forms/) has a clearly labeled "Release of Information Forms" section grouping all four documents. The only friction points were technical: PDF links are embedded in Divi theme JavaScript click handlers rather than standard HTML anchor tags, and the initial Spanish PDF URL found via search returned an error page (the working URL differed by one character in the filename). Neither issue would meaningfully impede a typical patient clicking through the website.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English ROI form (form-1) is a **well-constructed, fillable interactive PDF** — a 2-page document with 54 interactive form fields, a full text layer, and clean digital typography. It was clearly born-digital, not a scan. The form follows a logical structure: patient identification → direction of release → recipient details → purpose and frequency → granular record type selection (9+ categories plus 4 sensitive-information opt-ins) → legal disclosures → signature block → staff-only section.

The language is mostly **plain and accessible**. The rights section clearly states patients don't need to sign to receive treatment, provides a 30-day processing timeline, and offers two concrete revocation pathways. One minor grammatical error exists ("If have not received your records" — missing "you").

A notable accessibility gap: all 54 fillable fields **lack accessible names** (`fillable_field_names: []`), meaning screen readers cannot identify what each field is for. This is a significant deficiency for an otherwise well-designed digital form.

## Barriers and Compliance

VGMHC imposes **no illegitimate barriers**. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person submission mandate, no witness signature needed, and no fees mentioned. The form header provides both a fax number (503-357-4371) and a PO Box address, enabling remote submission. The 30-day processing commitment aligns with HIPAA requirements.

One concern is the **open-ended authorization duration** — the form defaults to remaining in effect "until my care ends with Virginia Garcia," which could mean years or decades for a patient in an ongoing care relationship. While the patient can specify a different date, the default is unusually long compared to typical 1-year expirations.

The form does not explicitly cite the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or frame patient record requests as a distinct legal entitlement — it treats all authorization types equivalently under a general HIPAA authorization framework.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both the main ROI form and the verbal release form are available in full English and Spanish versions — not bilingual addenda, but complete standalone translations. For an FQHC serving a predominantly Spanish-speaking community, this is a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Granular record selection**: Patients can choose specific record types (progress notes with date range, immunizations, labs, dental, medications, imaging, consultations) rather than an all-or-nothing approach, with separate opt-ins for sensitive categories.
- **Active document governance**: Version numbering (v6), effective/revision dates, and department ownership (Compliance) demonstrate ongoing form maintenance.

## Overall Assessment

Virginia Garcia earns a solid **B grade**. The organization makes its forms easy to find, provides a technically capable fillable PDF, offers meaningful bilingual access, and imposes no illegitimate barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway — a patient requesting their own records must navigate a generic authorization form designed for third-party releases. The form accommodates patient access (via the "For my own use" checkbox) but doesn't prioritize it. For an independent FQHC without portal infrastructure, this is a common pattern, and VGMHC handles it better than many peers thanks to its well-designed form documents and strong language accessibility.

# Saratoga Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Saratoga Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Saratoga Springs, NY, now part of the **Albany Med Health System (AMHS)**. Its original website (saratogahospital.org) redirects to albanymed.org/saratoga/. Two authorization forms were found: an older Saratoga Hospital–specific form (form-1.pdf, dated 2020) and the current system-wide AMHS form (form-2.pdf, dated November 2024). The system-wide form is the one actively linked from the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page and is the primary form a patient would encounter today.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release, Not Patient Access

Neither form offers a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both are titled "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" and are structured as third-party release authorizations. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Release Information To" / "Disclose To" field and select a purpose — an awkward workaround for what should be a straightforward right-of-access request. There is no checkbox, section, or simplified flow for "I want my own records." Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or explains patient access rights beyond the right to revoke authorization.

The system-wide form (form-2) does include a sidebar callout to **MyChart** (mychart.albanymed.org), the AMHS patient portal, as an alternative pathway. This is a meaningful digital option, though the form does not clarify what records are accessible through MyChart or whether it satisfies a full records request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A general web search returned direct links, and the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page is accessible without login or bot blocking. The only complexity is the redirect from the Saratoga Hospital domain to Albany Med, which could momentarily confuse a patient searching by the old hospital name. Both PDFs downloaded without difficulty.

## Form Document Quality (Primary: form-2.pdf)

The system-wide form is a strong technical document. It is a digitally constructed PDF (not a scan) with **65 fillable fields** — an unusually high count indicating comprehensive interactive coverage. Patients can complete every field on-screen without printing. The form spans 2 pages with a logical layout: patient demographics → record type selection → facility selection → sensitive information initials → recipient details → delivery method (page 1), then legal disclosures and signatures (page 2).

Record type options are granular (13 categories plus "Other"), and the form includes an "Entire Record" checkbox — an option absent from the older form-1. Delivery methods include email, fax, mail (with CD/USB options), and in-person pick-up. The multi-facility checkboxes let patients specify which AMHS hospital(s) to release from.

The main weakness is page 2: a dense wall of legal text covering revocation rights, HIV/AIDS protections, re-disclosure warnings, and 42 CFR Part 2 — all in small print with no headings, bullets, or visual hierarchy. The language is written at a college reading level. The footer on both pages contains a typo ("Dislcose" instead of "Disclose").

## Barriers

**Fee concern**: Both forms state a **$0.75/page copy fee** (phrased as "$0.75 cents per page" — a formatting error). The fee is waived for physician-to-physician transfers but not explicitly waived for patient self-access. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, per-page fees are generally impermissible; only reasonable cost-based fees are allowed. This is the most significant compliance concern.

**No witness required**: The newer system-wide form (form-2) removed the witness signature line that appeared on the legacy form-1 — a clear improvement.

**No notarization or in-person requirement**: Patients can submit by fax, email, or mail, satisfying the electronic submission baseline.

**No response time stated**: Neither form commits to a turnaround timeline.

## Notable Strengths

- **65 fillable fields** on the primary form — one of the most digitally complete ROI forms encountered
- **MyChart portal alternative** mentioned directly on the form
- **Granular record type and sensitive-information controls** with separate initials for HIV, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing
- **Multi-facility coverage** — a single form for all four AMHS hospitals reduces confusion

## Overall Assessment

Saratoga Hospital, via the Albany Med Health System, provides a technically polished and easily findable authorization form with excellent fillable-field coverage and a MyChart alternative. However, the experience is undermined by the complete absence of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must navigate a third-party release framework to exercise their individual access rights. The $0.75/page fee applied without distinguishing patient access from third-party release is a compliance concern. The form is a solid B-level document in terms of technical quality, but the lack of patient-centeredness and fee ambiguity hold back the overall score.

# Rhode Island Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rhode Island Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Providence, RI, is part of the Brown University Health system (formerly Lifespan). Two PDF forms were retrieved: a system-wide "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" form (form-1, updated October 2024) and a department-specific imaging-records release form (form-2, Lifespan Medical Imaging, revised February 2023). Form-1 is the primary form relevant to a patient requesting their own records from Rhode Island Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Rhode Island Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both retrieved forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. The primary form (form-1) frames the workflow around disclosing records *to* a named recipient ("To release to:"), which is the structure of a third-party authorization — not a patient self-access request. While the form does include "Patient Request" as a purpose checkbox (Section 4), a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in their own name as both the patient and the recipient. There is no separate form, section, or process that recognizes individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 as distinct from authorized disclosure to third parties.

The hospital does maintain a dedicated medical records request webpage at `brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records` with contact information, which is a helpful navigation aid. However, this page directs patients to the same generic authorization form rather than offering a simplified patient-access workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the primary form, and a site-specific search confirmed the URL and identified the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or other access barriers were encountered. The PDF was directly downloadable from a public URL. This is a strong point — many organizations make form discovery far more difficult.

## Form Document Quality

**Fillability**: The primary form is a born-digital PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being a recently updated document (October 2024), patients must print it and complete all fields by hand. This is a missed opportunity given the form's digital origin — adding interactive fields would be trivial.

**Layout and organization**: Form-1 uses a logical 11-section numbered structure covering facility selection, recipient, dates, purpose, format, record types, exclusions, and legal terms — all compressed onto a single page. The structure is clear, but the density is high, with legal boilerplate competing for space with patient-facing fields.

**Language**: The legal sections (8–11) use standard but dense regulatory language. No plain-language summary, explanatory guidance, or patient-friendly instructions are provided. A patient without familiarity with HIPAA authorization forms would likely find the legal sections intimidating.

**Record format options**: Limited to "paper" or "CD disc" — no electronic delivery option (email, portal, secure link) is offered. This is notable for a 2024 form, especially given HIPAA's requirement to provide records in the electronic format requested if readily producible.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Broad liability waiver**: Section 9 requires patients to "release Brown University Health, its employees and my physicians from all liability arising from this disclosure of my health information." Bundling a blanket liability release into a records authorization is aggressive and may discourage patients from exercising their access rights.
- **Vague fee language**: The form notes "There may be a fee associated with this request" without specifying amounts, providing a fee schedule, or distinguishing between patient-access fees (HIPAA-capped) and third-party release fees.
- **No electronic delivery**: Offering only paper and CD in 2024 creates a barrier for patients seeking digital access.
- **Out-of-state contact numbers**: Status inquiry numbers route to Massachusetts and California area codes, suggesting outsourced ROI processing — potentially confusing for Providence-based patients.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record-type selection**: ~10 specific record categories plus a behavioral health subsection, with a helpful "Abstract" definition footnote, give patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.
- **Sensitive information protections**: Five categories of sensitive information (sexual abuse, mental health, STIs, substance use, HIV) can be excluded, respecting both 42 CFR Part 2 and Rhode Island state law.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: A single form covers all Brown University Health facilities with clear checkboxes, avoiding the need to locate separate forms.
- **Easy findability**: Forms are prominently available online with no access barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Rhode Island Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and logically organized, but it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual access rights — through a generic third-party authorization workflow. The absence of fillable fields, electronic delivery options, and a patient-access-specific pathway places it squarely in the middle of the pack. The embedded liability waiver and vague fee language are concerning, though the granular record-type options and sensitive-information protections are commendable. A patient can successfully request records, but the process was clearly designed for institutional disclosure workflows rather than patient self-service.
