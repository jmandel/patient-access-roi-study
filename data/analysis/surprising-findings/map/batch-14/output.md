# Surprising Findings — Batch 14

## The For-Profit Paradox

The single highest-scoring organization in this batch is **Flowers Hospital** in Dothan, Alabama — a for-profit Community Health Systems (CHS) facility that earned the only **A grade** (4.65). Its dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" form with "Myself" as the primary option, 66-field fillable PDF, co-equal Spanish translation, and Swellbox portal alternative outperform nearly every nonprofit and academic medical center. Other for-profit standouts include **Merit Health Central** (MS, 4.15) and **TriStar Centennial** (TN, 3.9). Meanwhile, the overall average for for-profit organizations (3.28) is essentially indistinguishable from nonprofits (3.35). The expectation that profit-driven hospitals would cut corners on patient access doesn't hold; several appear to benefit from system-wide CHS or HCA form templates that impose a baseline of quality.

## Mississippi's Stark Internal Divide

Mississippi contains both near-best and worst-in-study outcomes. **Merit Health Central** (for-profit, 4.15) sits alongside **Neshoba General Hospital** (government, 1.2/F) and **Aaron E. Henry CHC** (FQHC, 1.2/F) — both of which publish literally no ROI form online. **UMMC**, the state's flagship academic medical center, scores only 2.85 (C), with its English-language form link returning a 404 error and a full SSN requirement. The pattern suggests that ownership structure matters more than geography: for-profit system affiliation lifted Merit Health, while independent government and nonprofit providers in the same state failed to provide even basic online access.

## JPS Health Network's Internal Contradiction

**JPS Health Network** (Fort Worth, TX) presents a striking internal disconnect: its 2025 HIE forms are modern, fillable, and accept encrypted email — demonstrating clear technical capability. Yet its core ROI authorization form is a seven-year-old image-only scan with no fillable fields, a fee schedule that charges $75 for electronic delivery (likely exceeding HIPAA's cost-based limit), and no distinction between patient access and third-party releases. The organization invested in digital infrastructure for health information exchange but neglected the form patients actually need.

## Small Rural Hospitals Punching Above Their Weight

Several critical access hospitals defy the resource-scarcity narrative. **Myrtue Medical Center** (Harlan, IA, 25 beds) offers a Spanish-language ROI form, MyChart portal delivery, encrypted email, and 42 CFR Part 2 substance-use carve-out language — earning 7 bright spots and a 3.65 (B). **Wayne County Hospital** (Monticello, KY, 25 beds) provides a parallel online web form for electronic submission, email delivery, and KRS 422.317 free-copy disclosure printed directly on the form. **Gritman Medical Center** (Moscow, ID) offers a 17-category granular record type selection with a "Major Documents for the Last 3 Years" shortcut. These tiny independent facilities match or exceed many 300+ bed system hospitals.

## The SSN Collection Problem Is Pervasive

Fully 46 organizations across every facility type request Social Security Numbers on their ROI forms — a practice with no HIPAA basis that creates identity theft risk, especially on faxable documents. Even prominent teaching hospitals like **Barnes-Jewish** (full SSN), **Duke** (last 4), and **UMMC** (full SSN) engage in this practice. The problem spans from 25-bed critical access hospitals (**Nemaha Valley**, **Lane County**) to major physician groups (**ENT & Allergy Associates**, **GI Alliance**). This isn't a small-provider issue — it's an industry-wide habit that no one has systematically questioned.

## The Dedicated Patient Form Gap

Only 22 of 190 organizations (12%) offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The overwhelming majority (142, 75%) route patients through a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party disclosures. The score difference is stark: dedicated forms average **3.88** vs. generic forms at **3.26**. Organizations like **Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin** (4.4), **Intermountain Medical Center** (4.4), and **Advocate Good Samaritan** (4.0) demonstrate what's possible with purpose-built patient forms — question-based headers, "Myself" as default recipient, transparent timelines. The 7 organizations offering only phone/in-person pathways score a dismal **1.45** average.

## Third-Party ROI Vendors as Shadow Infrastructure

Swellbox/Datavant appears in 36 organizations' records workflows and CIOX/MRO in 18 more — meaning roughly 28% of organizations have outsourced some aspect of records fulfillment. Paradoxically, having a portal doesn't guarantee quality: **Anaheim Global Medical Center** (Datavant portal, 2.45/D) and **Southwell-Tift Regional** (Swellbox, 2.75/C) show that a portal bolted onto a poor underlying form ecosystem doesn't fix the patient experience. The portal becomes another pathway to navigate rather than a replacement for good form design.
