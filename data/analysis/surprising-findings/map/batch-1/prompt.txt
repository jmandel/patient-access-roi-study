# Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital is a critical access hospital in Miller, SD, part of the Avera Health regional nonprofit system. The facility does not publish its own ROI form; instead, patients use Avera Health's system-wide "Authorization – Release Of Medical Records Information" form (Form 8691-04). Only one form was found applicable to this facility.

## Pathway Assessment: Generic Third-Party Authorization

The sole available form is a **general-purpose HIPAA authorization** designed for disclosure of records between any two parties. It does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third party (attorney, insurer, other provider) requesting records with patient authorization. The form's structure — with separate "Provider (Who is releasing information?)" and "Disclose Information to (Where is information to be sent?)" sections — frames the transaction as a release between entities, not as a patient exercising individual access rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524).

There is no dedicated patient access form, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no simplified workflow for self-access. A patient wanting their own records must complete the same authorization form as a third-party requester, filling in themselves as the recipient. The form does reference 45 CFR 164.524 in its authorization block, acknowledging the right to inspect or obtain copies, but this is buried in legal boilerplate rather than presented as a primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The Hand County facility profile page on avera.org does not link directly to any medical records form. A patient would need to navigate to Avera Health's system-level "Request Medical Records" page or perform a web search. Additionally, Avera's website **blocks automated downloads** (curl/wget return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. The form URL is descriptively named, which is a minor positive.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally generated PDF** with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, making it a print-and-handwrite document. Patients must print, fill by hand, and submit via fax or mail. The layout uses labeled left-margin sections (Patient Identification, Provider, Disclose Information to, etc.) which provide reasonable navigation, but fitting all content onto one page results in a visually dense, cramped document. The language mixes moderately plain English with regulatory references (42 CFR Part 2, 45 CFR 164.524) and HIV/AIDS disclosure warnings — functional but not optimized for patient readability.

The form asks for approximately 15–18 discrete fields including patient demographics, provider information, recipient information, record type checkboxes, date ranges, format preferences, purpose, expiration date, and signature. This is a moderate field count for an authorization form, though several fields (provider address, recipient fax) add complexity that a patient self-access form would not need.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is not required by HIPAA for access requests and may deter privacy-conscious patients.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" field is present without clarification of whether it is required or optional. If interpreted as mandatory, this creates an unnecessary barrier.
- **No submission instructions on form**: The form does not print a mailing address or designate the fax number as a submission destination; the Avera fax number (605-322-8200) appears only in the context of "questions about disclosure."
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Charges may apply" for entire record requests with no fee schedule or amounts provided.

## Bright Spots

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: The form offers paper, fax, flash drive, CD-ROM, and email — with encryption by default and an explicit opt-out for unencrypted delivery. This is a notably comprehensive set of format choices.
- **45 CFR 164.524 citation**: Explicit reference to the HIPAA Right of Access provision signals regulatory awareness.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Covering all required elements on one page reduces printing burden.

## Overall Assessment

Avera Hand County Memorial Hospital provides a functional but **generic, third-party-oriented** pathway for records access. The form is adequate for its purpose as a system-wide authorization but does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, SSN collection, and ambiguous witness requirement create friction. The strong delivery format options and 45 CFR 164.524 reference are bright spots, but the overall experience reflects an organization that has not optimized for patient-initiated access requests.

# WellSpan York Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

WellSpan York Hospital is part of WellSpan Health, a regional nonprofit health system in Pennsylvania. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms at the system level on wellspan.org. **Form-1.pdf** ("Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information," Form #2606, Rev. 08/25) is the primary system-wide form applicable to York Hospital and all other WellSpan facilities. **Form-2.pdf** ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information") is scoped exclusively to three WellSpan neighborhood hospitals (Newberry, Shrewsbury, Carlisle) and does not apply to York Hospital. The assessment below focuses on form-1.pdf as the relevant patient pathway.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WellSpan does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form or pathway distinct from third-party release. Form-1.pdf is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization with a bidirectional "Obtain from" / "Disclose to" structure designed for third-party transfers. However, the form does include a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an unusually clear statement of the right to self-access: *"I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."* This language partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated pathway, but a patient must still navigate a form framed around releasing records to another party and figure out how to adapt it for self-access (e.g., writing their own name in the "Disclose to" field).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A straightforward web search immediately returned a direct PDF link on wellspan.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. Multiple search strategies all converged on the same document. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1.pdf is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a complete text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally created, all fields are blank underscored lines, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient identification flows into record source/destination, then record type selection, purpose, delivery format, sensitive-records disclosure, legal terms, signatures, and submission instructions. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records paragraph on page 1 is a dense run-on sentence that could benefit from formatting improvements.

Record type options are well structured with five top-level categories (Abstract with detailed sub-list, Diagnostic Test Results, Imaging, Billing, and Complete record). Delivery format options are a standout feature: patients can choose Paper, CD, Fax, or Email, where the email option delivers records through a secure portal as PDFs available for 30 days.

## Barriers & Compliance

The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's SSN — an unnecessary data collection practice that introduces privacy risk without being required for patient identification. A witness signature line on page 2 creates ambiguity about whether a witness is routinely required or only for specific circumstances. Fees are mentioned as "regulated by state and federal law" but no specific amounts are disclosed. Notably, form processing is handled by MRO Corporation, a third-party ROI vendor, meaning patients interact with MRO rather than WellSpan directly.

On the positive side: the form explicitly accepts copies in lieu of originals, does not require notarization, and clearly states that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing. The 12-month authorization window is reasonable.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit the completed form via **fax** (717-812-8119), **email** (PatientRequests@wellspan.org), or **mail** to the York, PA HIM office. The availability of fax and email means patients are not required to physically visit the facility or rely solely on postal mail.

## Overall Assessment

WellSpan York Hospital provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed authorization form with modern delivery options (secure portal) and explicit right-to-self language. However, the absence of fillable fields in a born-digital PDF, the generic third-party authorization structure, the SSN collection, and witness ambiguity prevent it from reaching the top tier. The organization serves patients adequately but has clear room for improvement in both digital accessibility and patient-centered design.

# Synthesis: Aurora Medical Center - Grafton

## Overview

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton is a community hospital in Grafton, Wisconsin, operated by Advocate Health (formerly Advocate Aurora Health). The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones, drawing from Aurora Health Care's centralized medical records infrastructure. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also directs patients to its LiveWell patient portal for online record access.

## Forms and Pathways

Three forms were downloaded:

- **Form-1 and Form-2** are identical copies (same form number S300503 Rev. 11/25, same byte size) of the general "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — a third-party release form designed for authorizing disclosure to other providers, insurers, or attorneys. Two URLs exist for the same document, a minor source of confusion.
- **Form-3** is a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" (S88411-EN Rev. 11/25) — explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. It features a "Myself" checkbox, omits the purpose-of-release requirement, and opens with a callout to the LiveWell patient portal.

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3**. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, separate from the third-party authorization, is a meaningful structural choice that many organizations fail to make.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Aurora clearly differentiates individual access from third-party release. Form-3 is titled and structured around the patient's own request — no "Release the Requested Information to" recipient block, no purpose-of-release field, and a prominent "Myself" option. The patient portal callout ("Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org") is placed at the very top of the form, proactively directing patients to a faster digital channel before they even begin filling out the paper form. This is a best-practice design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Aurora Health Care maintains a well-organized medical records page at `/patients-visitors/medical-records`, reachable in about two clicks from the homepage. The page clearly lists all available forms with download links, including English and Spanish versions, instruction sheets, restriction request forms, accounting of disclosures, and revocation forms. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The forms also appeared in web search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean typography and logical section flow: patient demographics → treatment context → record type selection → recipient → delivery method → signature. The record-type selection is impressively granular, with 22+ checkbox options spanning medical records, imaging by modality, billing documents, and laboratory reports. The language is plain and accessible — the sensitive-information acknowledgment is straightforward without being alarming.

However, despite being digitally produced, form-3 has **zero interactive fillable fields**. All checkboxes are static glyphs, and all blanks require handwriting. This is the form's most significant weakness — adding fillable fields would be trivial for the design team and would dramatically improve the digital experience. The form is designed as a print-and-fill artifact published as a PDF.

## Submission and Delivery

The medical records page lists multiple submission methods: email, fax, mail, and in-person delivery. The form itself offers multiple delivery methods for receiving records: paper by mail, encrypted email, CD, patient portal, and in-person pickup. Offering both encrypted email and patient portal as electronic delivery options is progressive. The note "(Fees may apply)" appears but no fee amounts or schedule are provided — a common ambiguity.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The form correctly omits a purpose-of-release requirement for patient access. Non-discrimination language is present on the third-party form. Minor authorization provisions are detailed and legally careful. The main compliance gap is the vague fee disclosure — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

## Overall Assessment

Aurora Medical Center - Grafton, through its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form, a patient portal alternative, Spanish translations, and granular record-type selection. The retrieval experience is excellent and the content design is clear and well-organized. The primary weakness is the non-fillable PDF format, which forces a paper workflow despite the form being digitally authored. This technical gap prevents the organization from reaching the top tier, but the overall experience is solidly good — a patient requesting their own records has a clear, well-documented pathway with multiple submission and delivery options.

**Grade: B** (weighted score: 4.15/5.0)

# Riverside Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Riverside Community Hospital, an HCA Healthcare facility in Riverside, CA, provides three downloadable authorization forms for medical records release. **Form-2** (English, 1 page, 52 fillable fields) is the current official document, linked directly from the hospital's [medical records page](https://www.riversidecommunityhospital.com/patient-resources/medical-records). **Form-3** is a Spanish-language equivalent with identical structure and field count. **Form-1** is an older, 5-page non-fillable version hosted by a third-party ROI vendor (Legal Image) that is no longer linked from the hospital's website. The retrieval notes also mention a MyHealthONE patient portal and a Swellbox-based online request wizard, though the PDF forms remain the primary documented pathway.

## Patient Self-Access vs. Third-Party Release

Riverside Community Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization for Release of PHI" documents designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-2 does include a checkbox distinguishing "At the request of the individual" from "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form's overall structure still centers on designating a separate "Recipient" — a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly enter their own name and address as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 (right of access), no mention of the 30-day response deadline for patient access requests, and no distinction in fee treatment between patient access and third-party release. The form is a general-purpose HCA corporate template (HCA-840-00434), not something designed with the patient self-request experience in mind.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy** — the medical records page is accessible within 1-2 clicks from the main website under Patient Resources. Both English and Spanish forms are directly linked as downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that form-1 is served over HTTP (not HTTPS) by the third-party vendor, but this is not the primary form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is technically strong. It is a genuinely digital-first, fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields — checkboxes, radio buttons, and text fields — all on a single page. A patient can complete the form on-screen without printing. The layout is organized into three clearly labeled sections (A: authorization details, B: marketing/PHI sale, C: signatures), with 16 granular record-type checkboxes plus an "All Pertinent Records" option. The language is formal and clinical but generally comprehensible. However, the single-page format makes the form quite dense, and there are no standalone instructions or guidance text on the form itself (unlike form-1's two-page instruction set). The USCDI release request option is a rare and forward-looking inclusion, though the technical jargon ("Requires Direct Address or National Provider Identifier") would be meaningless to most patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

No significant barriers were identified. No notarization or witness signature is required. Submission can be made by mail (to HCA's Nashville, TN processing center) or by fax, satisfying the baseline for electronic submission. The SSN field is present but marked optional. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("a reasonable copy fee") without specifying amounts or distinguishing patient access from third-party release. No response time commitment is stated. The centralized Nashville mailing address means local submission is not mentioned on the current form, though a patient could potentially submit in person at the hospital's HIM department.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language parity**: Form-3 is a fully equivalent Spanish version with the same 52 fillable fields — genuine language access for Riverside's majority-Hispanic community.
- **USCDI release option**: Rare among ROI forms and signals awareness of interoperability standards.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with risk disclosure).
- **52 fillable fields**: Among the most technically complete fillable forms observed.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Patients are funneled through the same generic authorization form used for insurance companies and attorneys.
- **No right-of-access language**: The form never informs patients of their HIPAA right to access their own records or the associated protections (fee limits, 30-day timeline).
- **Centralized processing**: All requests route to Nashville, TN — no local submission address on the current form.
- **Grammar error persists**: "obtain a copy the information" (missing "of") appears across all form versions.

## Overall Assessment

Riverside Community Hospital delivers a technically competent but patient-generic records request experience. The fillable PDF, Spanish-language version, and multiple delivery options represent genuine strengths. However, the organization treats patient self-access as just another type of third-party release, missing an opportunity to provide a streamlined, patient-centered pathway. A patient can get their records through this process, but they receive no guidance tailored to their situation and may not understand their rights. The overall experience earns a **B** — solid technical execution held back by a one-size-fits-all approach to records access.

# Synthesis: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital

## Overview

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital in Murfreesboro, TN is part of Ascension, the largest nonprofit Catholic health system in the U.S. For medical records requests, the hospital relies on two pathways: a **Swellbox-based online request wizard** (the primary pathway linked from the patient portal page) and a **downloadable PDF authorization form** (STHS490) shared across the entire Ascension Saint Thomas system in Tennessee. Only the PDF form was available for detailed evaluation. No dedicated patient access request form was found — the single PDF serves both patient self-access and third-party release.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information at the form level. The PDF form (STHS490) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Disclosure of PHI" that handles both use cases through a single "and/or" construction: patients can check "Use my health information" and/or "Disclose my health information to the following individual or organization." A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same form — including specifying themselves as the recipient — as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), the 30-day response obligation, or patient-specific fee limits.

However, the existence of the **Swellbox online wizard** as the primary pathway is significant. Though we could not evaluate the wizard's internal design, the fact that patients are directed to an online request tool — rather than solely to a downloadable PDF — suggests a more modern and potentially more patient-friendly experience as the default path. This partially mitigates the generic nature of the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form was **easy**. A targeted Google search on the second attempt returned a direct link. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or browser fallback was needed. The form is hosted on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure (the URL path includes "legacy"), suggesting it predates the current website architecture and is discoverable primarily via search engines rather than site navigation. The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, is linked from the patient portal page via normal site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF form (STHS490) is a **single page** — concise and complete. It uses a numbered structure (items 1–7) with a logical flow from patient identification through record type selection, rights notice, and signature. The record type checklist (ten options plus "Other") gives patients meaningful control over scope. Contact phone numbers for all eight Saint Thomas facilities are listed, which is helpful.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. The layout is dense, with small fonts (likely 8–9pt in places) cramming all content onto one page. Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese, particularly in the revocation clause (item 5). There are no separate instructions, no multilingual versions, and no plain-language summary of patient rights.

The form offers **mail and email delivery** checkboxes (item 7), which is better than forms limited to mail or in-person pickup. Combined with the Swellbox wizard for online submission, a patient has viable electronic pathways available.

## Barriers

The most notable barrier is the **SSN field combined with "ALL BLANKS MUST BE COMPLETED"** — implying SSN is mandatory. HIPAA does not require SSN for a records authorization, and requiring it creates both a privacy risk and a potential deterrent. The form also uses stale branding ("Saint Thomas Health" in body text vs. "Ascension Saint Thomas" in footer) and has a filename/form number mismatch (sths409 vs. STHS490), which are minor but erode trust in document currency.

No notarization or witness is required. No fees are mentioned on the form. The six-month default expiration is reasonable.

## Strengths

- **Online alternative (Swellbox wizard)** as the primary pathway
- **Email delivery option** on the PDF form
- **Granular record type checklist** with helpful descriptions
- **HIM contact numbers** for all facilities listed directly on the form
- **Easy findability** — no search difficulties

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox online wizard as the primary pathway is a meaningful strength that elevates the organization above those relying solely on PDF forms. However, the PDF form itself — the only document available for detailed evaluation — is a generic third-party authorization form with no fillable fields, an implied SSN requirement, and no acknowledgment of patient self-access as a distinct right. The organization earns credit for offering electronic pathways but falls short on patient-centeredness and form document quality.

# Barrett Hospital & HealthCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Barrett Hospital & HealthCare is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Dillon, Montana. The organization offers a single pathway for patients requesting their medical records: a one-page PDF authorization form linked from a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page on its Wix-hosted website. Only one form was found during the retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Barrett Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole form — titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios, including inter-provider transfers, third-party releases, and patient access. The form includes dual "RECEIVE from" / "RELEASE to" fields, a compensation disclosure clause, and language about conditioning treatment on signing — elements that are appropriate for third-party authorizations but inappropriate and potentially confusing when a patient is simply exercising their HIPAA right of access under § 164.524. There is no mention of patient access rights anywhere on the form.

The "Purpose" field does include "Personal Use" as a circled option, which is the closest the form comes to acknowledging patient self-access. However, this is a single option among several on a general-purpose form, not a dedicated pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search quickly identified the "Request Medical Records" page, which features a clearly labeled download link. For a small rural critical access hospital, this level of web accessibility is commendable — many larger organizations make their forms harder to find. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **natively digital PDF but not fillable** — it has zero interactive form fields. Patients must print, handwrite their responses on blank lines, and return the form via fax, mail, or in-person pickup. The "circle one" instructions for format and delivery options confirm the print-and-handwrite design intent.

Despite the non-fillable limitation, the form is well-organized and concise at a single page. It follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → date ranges → format/delivery → legal notices → signature. The record-type section uses an efficient tabular layout with per-category date ranges. The turnaround time ("10 days") is stated prominently at the top — a practice many organizations neglect entirely.

The language is mostly plain, though the legal paragraphs at the bottom are denser. The "Initial" column in the record-type table is ambiguous — patients are apparently expected to initial next to each record type they want, but this is never explained. The abbreviation "Disc" next to imaging options is also cryptic.

The form collects last four digits of SSN, which is unnecessary under HIPAA for identity verification and may deter some patients. Delivery options include pick up, fax, and mail — fax qualifies as an electronic submission pathway per our scoring baseline, so the organization meets the minimum for remote submission.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The most significant compliance issue is the conditioning language: "I understand that I may refuse this authorization and that my refusal to sign may affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment or my eligibility for benefits." Under HIPAA § 164.524, providers cannot condition treatment on a patient's willingness to authorize access to their own records. Because this dual-purpose form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release, this problematic language is presented to all requestors regardless of context.

The compensation disclosure clause ("I understand that _____ will receive compensation for its use/disclosure of the information") is similarly irrelevant for patient access requests and adds confusion. No fee schedule is disclosed on the form or the website's medical records page.

## Strengths

- **Easy findability** with a dedicated medical records page and clear download link
- **Concise single-page design** that reduces patient burden
- **Stated turnaround time** of 10 days sets clear expectations
- **Fax submission available**, providing a remote electronic pathway
- **42 CFR Part 2 and redisclosure notices** are properly included

## Overall Assessment

Barrett Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of small independent hospitals. The form is easy to find, reasonably organized, and concise, but it is a generic third-party authorization form repurposed for all disclosure purposes — including patient self-access — without any differentiation. The non-fillable PDF and conditioning language are the most notable shortcomings. For a critical access hospital with limited resources, the web presence and form accessibility are respectable, but the organization misses the mark on patient-centeredness by failing to treat individual access as distinct from third-party release.

# Lankenau Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lankenau Medical Center is part of **Main Line Health**, a regional nonprofit health system in suburban Philadelphia. The facility does not publish its own records request form; instead, it uses a system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form managed centrally by Main Line Health. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URLs on mainlinehealth.org — form-1.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0621, June 2021) with 41 fillable fields and interactive buttons, and form-2.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0325, March 2025) as a flat, non-interactive PDF with zero fillable fields. Both are 2-page documents with identical content structure.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed to serve all disclosure purposes — release to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. That said, Main Line Health does include **"Patient personal use"** as an explicit purpose checkbox, which is a positive accommodation. However, the form's framing remains disclosure-oriented: it asks the patient to specify "This information is to be disclosed to: Name of Person or Institution," meaning a patient requesting their own records must somewhat awkwardly write their own name as the disclosure recipient. There is no separate, streamlined pathway for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A straightforward web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No bot blocking, authentication, or patient portal login was required. The form is prominently published on the Main Line Health website. The only minor friction is that two versions coexist at different URLs without any clear indication of which is current — a patient could inadvertently download the older fillable version or the newer flat version.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing based on **form-1.pdf** (the fillable version, which provides the better patient experience):

- **Fillable fields**: Yes — 41 interactive fields plus PRINT, SAVE AS, EMAIL, and RESET action buttons. The EMAIL button suggests the form can be completed and submitted entirely digitally. This is genuinely digital-first design.
- **Layout**: Clean and logically organized — facility selection → patient ID → date range → record types → sensitive information → recipient → purpose → delivery → expiration → signatures, with a full instructions page on the reverse.
- **Language**: A mix of plain and legal language. The rights acknowledgment paragraphs are substantive but dense. Instructions on page 2 are clear and well-structured.
- **Instructions**: Thorough. Numbered instructions cover completion requirements, submission methods (fax, email, mail, walk-in), a delivery options matrix by recipient type, fee information, and detailed signing authority guidance for minors, incapacitated patients, and deceased patients under PA law.
- **Delivery options**: Exceptionally strong — six options including encrypted USB, MyChart portal, printed paper (pick-up or mail), fax, and encrypted email/third-party portal. A clear table shows availability by recipient type.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Prepayment language**: The instructions state "payment will be expected prior to the records being delivered," which could function as a barrier to patient access. Under HIPAA, covered entities should not condition record delivery on prepayment in a way that creates unreasonable barriers.
- **Witness line ambiguity**: A "(Signature of Witness)" field is present but the form does not clarify whether a witness is required, potentially confusing patients completing the form at home.
- **Fee amounts undisclosed**: The form references fees "in accordance with Federal and PA State Law" but does not specify amounts, leaving patients uncertain about costs.
- **No notarization required**: Correct — the form does not impose this unnecessary barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Excellent delivery options** with encrypted electronic formats and a clear availability matrix
- **Fillable PDF** with embedded action buttons (form-1 version)
- **"Patient personal use" checkbox** that normalizes self-access requests
- **Detailed signing authority guidance** reflecting PA-specific law
- **Sensitive information opt-in** with separate checkboxes for HIV, psychiatric, and substance abuse records
- **HIPAA-compliant response timelines** clearly stated (30/60 days with 30-day extension)

## Overall Assessment

Main Line Health provides an above-average records request experience for Lankenau Medical Center patients. The form is easy to find, technically well-executed (in its fillable version), and offers unusually comprehensive delivery options. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic third-party disclosure form and adapt it to their own needs. The prepayment language and undisclosed fee amounts are minor compliance concerns. Overall, this represents a solid **B-grade** experience: a patient can accomplish their goal, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# HopeHealth (Florence, SC) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

HopeHealth is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Florence, South Carolina. The organization has fully outsourced its medical records release process to HealthMark Group, a third-party vendor. No HopeHealth-branded ROI or authorization form exists as a publicly downloadable document. Instead, the organization's medical records page directs patients exclusively to HealthMark's online Request Manager portal.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved during the evaluation:

1. **form-1.pdf** — HopeHealth's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP). This is an informational document, not an authorization or request form. It mentions patients' right to access records but provides no actionable mechanism beyond directing them to the Privacy Officer's contact information.

2. **form-2.pdf** — A generic HealthMark Group Medical Records Release Authorization form. This was found on HealthMark's parent company website (hmutx.com), *not* on HopeHealth's website. It is unbranded and could apply to any HealthMark client facility.

The **primary pathway** for a patient is the HealthMark Request Manager online portal, linked from HopeHealth's medical records page at `https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/`. This portal requires email verification to initiate a request.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

HopeHealth does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The generic HealthMark form lists "Patient Request" as one of six purposes alongside Attorney, Insurance, Disability, and Referring Physician — treating patient access as a flavor of general disclosure rather than a distinct legal right under HIPAA § 164.524. The form cites § 164.508 (authorization for disclosure) throughout, which is the wrong legal framework for individual right-of-access requests. It is unknown whether the HealthMark portal differentiates these pathways internally, as the portal could not be accessed without email verification.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was **hard**. Extensive web searches, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine checks, and HTML source inspection failed to locate any HopeHealth-specific authorization form. Search results were complicated by name confusion with Hope Health Ellis County, TX (a different organization). The HealthMark portal is gated behind email verification, making it impossible to evaluate the actual request workflow or any forms within it. The Wayback Machine confirmed this portal-only approach has been consistent since at least 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The generic HealthMark form (form-2.pdf) is a digitally-created single-page PDF but has **no fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite or use annotation tools. It contains approximately 15 data fields and 11 record-type checkboxes. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (recipient → patient → dates → records → purpose → acknowledgments → signature), but the content is dense, with inline CFR citations and legal language that would challenge many patients. There are no instructions for completion, no statement of patient rights, and no options for how records should be delivered.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are not disclosed anywhere — neither on the form, the NPP, nor the medical records page. The generic form imposes a fixed 180-day expiration on the authorization, which would not apply to a § 164.524 access request. The NPP contains a notable typo: the Privacy Officer's email is listed as `HIPPA@hope-health.org` (misspelling HIPAA), which could undermine patient confidence and cause email delivery issues.

## Strengths

The decision to outsource to an online portal (HealthMark Group) is conceptually a strength — it provides a digital pathway that avoids requiring patients to download, print, and mail forms. The NPP, while dense, includes concrete patient-friendly examples of permitted uses and addresses substance use disorder protections. The generic form offers granular record-type selection with 11 categories.

## Overall Assessment

HopeHealth's approach is a mixed bag. The online portal represents a modern, potentially patient-friendly pathway, but the organization provides no transparency about what that portal experience entails. There is no downloadable form for patients who prefer a traditional approach, no fee disclosure, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The available documentation (NPP and generic form) has quality issues including dense legalese, wrong HIPAA citations, and a notable typo. A patient navigating this system would find their way to the portal with moderate effort but would encounter opacity about the process, fees, and timeline.

# Valley Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Valley Medical Group (VMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice with offices in Amherst, Easthampton, Greenfield, and Northampton, Massachusetts. For medical records requests, VMG fully delegates to **MediCopy**, a third-party Health Information Management vendor. The practice does not publish its own ROI form — instead, its website (vmgma.com) features a prominent "REQUEST RECORDS" link that redirects patients to MediCopy's patient portal at medicopy.net.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Two PDF authorization forms were found, both hosted on MediCopy's website:

- **form-1.pdf** — MediCopy's generic English-language authorization for release of medical records
- **form-2.pdf** — Spanish-language version of the same MediCopy form

MediCopy also offers an online HelloSign-based authorization (https://app.hellosign.com/s/01LCH5zj), providing a fully digital alternative to the PDF. The English PDF (form-1.pdf) is the most relevant document for assessing the patient experience, as it is the standard-language version of the form VMG patients are directed to use.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

VMG does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic MediCopy release-of-information authorizations designed for sending records to a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own information twice — once as the patient and again as the recipient — and select "Personal Use" from the purpose options. While "Personal Use" is listed, the form's structure (with separate "patient" and "recipient" sections) is clearly oriented toward disclosure to others. There is no dedicated patient access form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no streamlined self-request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form requires **moderate effort**. The "REQUEST RECORDS" link on vmgma.com is visible in the header and footer, which is helpful. However, clicking it sends the patient to medicopy.net — a third-party domain that may feel unfamiliar or untrustworthy. From there, the patient must navigate to MediCopy's ROI landing page to find the downloadable PDF, a 3-click cross-domain journey. A web search for "Valley Medical Group medical records request" would not surface the MediCopy form, since it contains no VMG branding whatsoever. The "Facility Name" field is blank — patients must know what to write.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (7 fonts, proper text extraction), it functions as a print-and-fill document. The layout is clean and uses conversational section headers phrased as questions ("Tell us about the patient," "What would you like released?"), which is more approachable than typical legal-heavy forms. Record type selection offers 11 checkboxes plus exclusion options for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric records), giving patients meaningful control. Delivery methods include email, fax, and postage.

However, the form has **no submission instructions** — no address, fax number, or email for returning the completed authorization. A patient who downloads this PDF in isolation would have no idea where to send it. The file is also disproportionately large (1.39 MB for one page).

## Barriers and Compliance

- **No notarization or witness required** — positive
- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for a records release and creates a privacy risk
- **Fee disclosure**: The English form mentions an "additional fee" for postage but provides no fee schedule; the Spanish form references 45 CFR 164.524 and mentions a "reasonable fee" but discloses no amounts
- **No response time commitment** stated
- **Default release of sensitive records**: The opt-out framing means substance abuse, HIV, and psychiatric records are released unless the patient affirmatively checks exclusion boxes

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form available** — meaningful for a small independent practice
- **Online HelloSign alternative** exists alongside the PDF, providing a digital submission pathway
- **Email delivery option** for receiving records
- **Sensitive-information exclusion checkboxes** give patients granular control
- **Conversational, plain-language headers** make the form approachable

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No VMG branding or customization** — completely generic MediCopy form
- **No fillable fields** on the PDF despite digital creation
- **No submission instructions** on the form itself
- **SSN collection** is unnecessary and risky
- **No patient rights statement** regarding Right of Access or fee limitations
- **Poor Spanish translation** with mistranslations ("lanzado" for "released") and grammatical errors

## Overall Assessment

Valley Medical Group provides a functional but generic pathway for records requests through its MediCopy partnership. The "REQUEST RECORDS" link on the homepage is a reasonable starting point, and the availability of both a PDF form and an online HelloSign option gives patients choices. However, the complete lack of VMG customization, the absence of fillable PDF fields, missing submission instructions, and the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release all indicate a process that was outsourced without much thought given to the patient experience. The form serves its administrative purpose but does not center the patient.

# Fallon Medical Complex — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Fallon Medical Complex (FMC) is a small independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Baker, Montana — a rural community in the state's eastern plains. FMC publishes three documents on its Information Management page: a primary ROI authorization form (form-1), a verbal release form (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3). The primary ROI form is the relevant document for a patient seeking copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

FMC does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form — "Authorization for Access, Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. A patient wanting their own records must navigate the same "Release From" / "Release To" fields used when authorizing disclosure to an insurer or attorney. The form does list "Personal" as a purpose option, which is helpful, but provides no guidance on how a patient should fill in the directional fields when they are both the requester and the recipient. This is a common pattern among small facilities, but it means the patient must figure out which parts of the form apply to their situation.

The verbal release form (form-2) is narrowly scoped to phone-based verbal sharing and explicitly directs patients to form-1 for copies. The NPP (form-3) describes patient rights including the right to inspect and copy records but does not cross-reference the actual forms.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Two web searches led directly to the Information Management page at fallonmedical.org, where all three documents are clearly linked. No login walls, CAPTCHAs, or bot blocking were encountered. The one notable issue: the primary ROI form is published as a Microsoft Word .doc file rather than a PDF, hosted on a Google Cloud Storage bucket with "tmp" in the URL path — an unusual and potentially fragile hosting arrangement for a permanent compliance document.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page document with **zero fillable fields**. It was published as a .doc file and had to be converted to PDF for this study. The lack of fillable fields means every patient must print and handwrite their information. The form has a text layer (not a scan), uses 5 fonts, and is visually legible, but the non-interactive format is a significant accessibility gap — especially for a geographically isolated community where patients may live far from the facility.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → release routing → purpose → record types → date range → disclosure format → sensitive information → patient rights → signatures. The information-type checkboxes offer good granularity (10 categories from "Emergency Report/Records" to "Entire Medical Record"). The dual sensitive-information sections — one for categories to include, one to exclude — are structurally sound but confusingly similar, with identical checkbox labels distinguished only by a header word.

Language is a mix of accessible and legalistic. The "I Understand That" section covers core rights (revocation, non-conditioning, inspection under §164.524) but is dense. There are two spelling errors ("immunodefiency" twice, "proving" for "providing") and a confusing interstitial note ("IF SENDING RECORDS TO FMC, PLEASE MAIL IF MORE THAN 20 PAGES") apparently directed at other facilities rather than patients.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization is required (the witness signature is in the "For Office Use Only" section). Photo ID is required for fax, mail, or email submissions — reasonable identity verification, though potentially burdensome for patients without government-issued ID. The statement "A HIM professional will supervise the review of my medical record" adds friction to in-person review that may feel paternalistic.

**Notable bright spots for a rural CAH:**
- **First copy free** — the form explicitly states patients may receive the first copy without charge, reducing financial barriers.
- **Seven disclosure format options** — paper mail, USB drive/disc, electronic fax, review only, paper pick-up, unencrypted email (with informed consent), and patient portal access. This is remarkably comprehensive for a 25-bed rural hospital.
- **Patient portal integration** — offering portal signup directly from the ROI form bridges paper and digital workflows.
- **Unencrypted email with informed consent** — respects patient autonomy while ensuring awareness of risks.

Submission of the completed form appears possible via fax, mail, or email (implied by the ID requirement language), meaning patients do not need to physically visit the facility.

## Overall Assessment

Fallon Medical Complex demonstrates a sincere effort to serve patients within the constraints of a small rural facility. The breadth of delivery format options is genuinely impressive and patient-centered. However, the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a patient access request, published in an outdated format (.doc) with no fillable fields. A patient must print, handwrite, and fax or mail the form — a workflow that falls short of modern accessibility expectations. For a critical access hospital in rural Montana, FMC does better than many peers, but meaningful improvements are within reach: converting to a fillable PDF, separating the patient access pathway, and adding clear instructions for self-access requests would significantly improve the experience.

# Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Chandler, AZ, with eight office locations across the Phoenix metro area. Three documents were retrieved: an incoming records request form (form-1), the primary outbound ROI authorization form (form-2), and a new patient forms packet from a sister site (form-3). Only form-2 serves a patient requesting their own records from Ironwood.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Ironwood does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-2, a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" designed to serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party release, legal, insurance, and disability. The form uses a "To" and "From" field structure oriented toward third-party transfers, which can confuse patients seeking their own records. However, "Personal Use" is explicitly listed as the first purpose option, which partially signals awareness of patient self-access as a legitimate use case.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or use individual-access-specific language. A patient must navigate a form designed around third-party release and determine which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the ROI form required **moderate-to-significant effort**. The patient forms page at ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/ existed but did not expose downloadable links — possibly due to JavaScript rendering requirements or link removal. The primary ROI form (form-2) was only discoverable via site-specific search engine queries. Its URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/`) suggests it dates from March 2019 and may be effectively orphaned. Ironically, the incoming records form (form-1) was updated more recently (November 2023) and is fillable, suggesting the organization invested in making it easy for other providers to send records to Ironwood while neglecting the patient-facing release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable/interactive fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a notable gap, especially given that form-1 (the incoming records form) has 22 fillable fields. The asymmetry suggests intentional or negligent underinvestment in the patient-facing document.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → record types → date range → purpose → delivery method → legal disclosures → signatures. Seven record type categories (physician's notes, lab reports, radiology reports, biopsy reports, prescriptions, radiology imaging, plus "Other") provide reasonable granularity for a cancer center. Five delivery methods are offered: fax, secure email, mail, pick up, and patient portal — a strong set of options including two electronic channels beyond fax.

The form lacks any introductory instructions or plain-language guidance. Legal disclosures are presented in dense paragraph format on page 2, though "I UNDERSTAND THAT" headers provide some scannability. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions available.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fee disclosure is vague: "A fee may be charged for providing the protected health information" — no amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees. This ambiguity could discourage patients.

No notarization or witness signature is required. The non-conditioning statement is present and appropriate. Revocation rights are clearly stated. The authorization expires after one year, which is standard.

A notable red flag on form-1 (though not the primary patient form): the STD definition section cites Washington state law (RCW 70.24) despite Ironwood being an Arizona practice — a template-copy error that raises questions about form review diligence.

## Strengths

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: Offering secure email and patient portal alongside fax, mail, and pickup gives patients meaningful choice — better than many comparable practices.
- **"Personal Use" as an explicit purpose**: Listing this as the first purpose option is a small but meaningful signal of patient access awareness.
- **Reasonable record type granularity**: The checkbox categories are well-suited to oncology records.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable patient form vs. fillable provider form**: The clearest indicator of misaligned priorities.
- **Orphaned form**: Not linked from any active webpage; discoverable only via search engines.
- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Generic authorization for all release types.
- **Vague fee language**: Could deter patients from exercising their access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers provides a **minimally adequate** but clearly deprioritized pathway for patient self-access to records. The generic authorization form technically works for patient self-access, and the inclusion of electronic delivery options (secure email, patient portal) is a genuine strength. However, the non-fillable form, orphaned web presence, vague fee language, and lack of any patient-access-specific design collectively signal that individual record access is not a priority for this organization. A patient can get their records, but only after navigating search engines to find a form that wasn't designed for them.

# Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital is a community hospital in Fairfield, Ohio, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system. Medical records requests are managed centrally through the parent system's website at mercy.com, which provides a dedicated medical records request page covering all Mercy Health facilities. The hospital is listed as a checkbox option on the Cincinnati-region authorization form, with a dedicated fax number (513-599-4491).

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were downloaded. **Form-1** is an older Cincinnati-region "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (MHP 0786 Rev 1/19) with a full text layer and 5,192 characters of extractable text. **Form-2** is a newer system-wide version of the same form (printed 2024-01-17), but it is an image-only scan with only 46 characters of metadata — a significant regression in digital accessibility. Form-2 is the version currently linked from the medical records page; form-1's URL still works but is no longer prominently linked.

Beyond PDF forms, Mercy Health offers **MyChart** (patient portal) and an **online eRequest system** through Ciox/Datavant (Swellbox) at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html, providing genuinely electronic alternatives. A **Spanish-language** version of the authorization form is also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for all release-of-information purposes, not dedicated patient access forms. However, the form does accommodate patient self-access reasonably well: **"Self" is the first checkbox** in the recipient section, and the default purpose is "For Personal use if not otherwise stated." The form explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 (the individual right of access provision). While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, patient self-access is clearly a recognized use case rather than an afterthought.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately returned the Mercy Health medical records page. The centralized page is well-organized with facility-specific fax numbers, links to forms (English and Spanish), and information about MyChart and eRequest options. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing the best available PDF form (form-1, the text-layer version): it is a **single-page**, well-organized form with a logical flow from patient demographics through facility selection, date range, record types, recipient, delivery method, purpose, and legal disclosures. The form offers granular record-type checkboxes (10 specific categories plus "Other" and "Entire record") and four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email). Format defaults to electronic (PDF/CD) if unspecified.

However, neither form has **fillable fields** — both require printing and handwriting. Form-1 at least has a proper text layer making it searchable and compatible with assistive technology. Form-2, the currently linked version, is a flat scan that is completely inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally at all. The replacement of a functional digital PDF with an image scan is a notable regression.

## Barriers

- **Photo ID required**: The form states "Photo ID required at the time of request," which could exclude patients without government-issued identification.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "There may be a charge for copies of records" provides no specific amounts or fee schedule.
- **"Standard two years" default**: The "Entire record" option defaults to two years of information unless otherwise specified — patients expecting their full history may receive only a subset.
- No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission — fax, mail, MyChart, and secure email are available.

## Notable Strengths

- Multiple request pathways including MyChart and Swellbox/Datavant online portal
- Spanish-language form available
- "Self" as the first recipient option; electronic format as default
- Explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation
- Single-page form design
- Centralized, easy-to-navigate medical records page

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The availability of MyChart and the Swellbox online portal significantly elevates the digital pathway beyond the PDF forms alone. The PDF forms themselves are adequate in content design but limited by the lack of fillable fields, and the current primary linked form (an image scan) represents a troubling accessibility regression. The generic HIPAA authorization approach — while clearly accommodating patient self-access — falls short of a dedicated patient access pathway. The overall experience is functional but not exemplary.

# Northwestern Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Northwestern Memorial Hospital, part of the Northwestern Medicine / Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) system, publishes three documents related to medical records requests. The primary form is **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form 8094, rev. 2/2026) — a system-wide ROI authorization covering all 11 NMHC hospitals, physician groups, and behavioral health locations. **Form-3.pdf** is a full Spanish translation of the same form (8094SP, rev. 8/2024). **Form-2.pdf** is a separate inbound records request form for transferring records *into* NMHC from other providers — not relevant for patient self-access.

All forms are published at the system level on nm.org and are used across all NMHC entities. Northwestern Memorial Hospital does not maintain facility-specific forms.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Northwestern Medicine does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to attorneys, insurers, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" as the purpose, then list themselves as the recipient in the "Send Information To" section. This is functional but unintuitive: the form was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) anywhere on the form. This matters because Right of Access requests carry different fee limits and timing requirements than third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was trivially easy. A basic web search returned direct download links to the PDFs hosted on nm.org's media CDN. No website navigation, login, CAPTCHA, or bot-blocking was encountered. The URLs are descriptive and the forms are well-organized in the patients-and-visitors section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **79 fillable fields** — text inputs, checkboxes, and date fields can all be completed digitally without printing. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → facility selection → purpose → record types → delivery method → medical images → recipient → legal disclosures → signatures. Record-type categories include helpful parenthetical explanations (e.g., "Hospital Stay (History and physical, progress notes, consultations, operative reports, discharge summary, test results)") that help patients understand what they're requesting. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The legal disclosure section is moderately dense but covers required elements: 30-day response window, right to revoke, no care denial for refusal to sign, and sensitive-record opt-outs (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic testing, mental health). The language is somewhat complex but not impenetrably legalistic.

## Submission and Delivery

Submission options are strong: mail (Winfield, IL), fax (312.926.3093), and email (releaseofinformation@nm.org). Delivery options are notably forward-looking: **MyNM patient portal**, fax, email, and US mail (CD or paper). The portal delivery option is a standout feature that removes a common access barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or in-person requirements exist. Fees are referenced vaguely — "Standard record copying fees per 735 ILCS 5/8-2006 may apply" — without specific amounts or clarification that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a cost-based amount. This ambiguity could lead patients to expect the (higher) Illinois statutory copying fees even for personal-use requests.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form** with the same 82 fillable fields — Spanish-speaking patients get equal digital functionality
- **MyNM portal delivery** alongside fax, email, and mail
- **Email submission** (still uncommon among healthcare organizations)
- **Memorable toll-free number**: 877.9RECORD with TTY: 711 support
- **Parenthetical record-type explanations** helping patients understand each category

## Notable Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway — generic authorization form for all release types
- No reference to HIPAA Right of Access or patient access rights
- Fee language references Illinois statute without distinguishing patient-access fee limits
- Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version (missing hospital renaming, updated 42 CFR Part 2 language, and TTY reference)

## Overall Assessment

Northwestern Medicine provides a technically strong, easy-to-find form ecosystem with excellent digital features (fillable fields, email submission, portal delivery, Spanish translation). The primary weakness is structural: the organization channels all records requests — including patient self-access — through a generic authorization form designed for third-party release, without acknowledging the distinct rights and fee limits that apply to individual access under HIPAA. The form works well for patients who know what they need, but it wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.

# Boulder Medical Center — Organization Synthesis

## Available Pathways

Boulder Medical Center (BMC) presents patients with three record-request pathways, clearly laid out on their [Medical Records department page](https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/departments/medical-records/): (1) a Swellbox online portal for records created before September 9, 2024; (2) the MyChart "Sharing Hub" for records after that date; and (3) a downloadable PDF authorization form. The PDF form (`form-1.pdf`) was the only traditional document available for download and is the focus of this evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

BMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The single PDF form — titled "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Patient Information" — is a generic ROI authorization designed to handle bidirectional record transfers between entities. While the phrase "I am requesting my records" appears, the form's structure treats the patient as a routing intermediary rather than the information recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no language explaining patient-specific rights beyond the standard no-conditioning clause. The online portals (Swellbox and MyChart) may provide a more patient-centric experience, but neither was evaluated as a downloadable form document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search led directly to the Medical Records page, where the PDF is clearly linked under "Option 2." No bot-blocking, JavaScript rendering, or deep navigation was required. The page helpfully contextualizes the PDF as one of three options, giving patients a clear choice. This is a strong findability result.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a single-page, digitally-created document — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores, requiring patients to print and handwrite. The layout follows a logical flow (demographics → delivery method → record types → entity information → authorization → signatures), but the authorization section is a dense block of nine "I understand" statements with no visual separation. The form includes some genuinely helpful plain-language disclosures ("once this information is disclosed by BMC, it will no longer be protected by BMC"), though the dual-direction design ("from the Entity... to be mailed to ___ at BMC" vs. "to be sent to Entity listed below") is confusing for a patient requesting their own records for personal use. Record type options are limited to five categories with no "all records" checkbox.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form states a 10-business-day processing time, well within HIPAA's 30-day window. It correctly includes a no-conditioning clause and a 180-day expiration. However, the fee disclosure is vague ("there may be a cost to copy the records") with no schedule or estimate. Most concerning is the email restriction: "Due to HIPAA regulations regarding security of electronic transmissions, we cannot email records to anyone but your personal email." This mischaracterizes HIPAA, which explicitly grants patients the right to direct records to a third party. The designated agent language is also narrowly scoped, covering only incapacitated patients rather than parents of minors or POA holders. Submission can be done by fax (303-449-9380) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple pathways**: The website clearly presents three options (Swellbox, MyChart, PDF), giving patients choices based on their record dates and preferences.
- **Single-page conciseness**: The form avoids the multi-page burden common at other organizations.
- **Plain-language disclosures**: Several authorization statements are unusually clear and honest.
- **Easy findability**: The form is prominently linked from a well-organized Medical Records page.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** despite being a digitally-created PDF — a missed opportunity.
- **No patient access differentiation**: The form treats all requests identically regardless of who is requesting and why.
- **Misleading HIPAA email restriction**: Incorrectly frames a policy choice as a legal requirement.
- **Stale form**: Revision date January 2019, uploaded November 2020, but a major system transition occurred in September 2024.

## Overall Assessment

Boulder Medical Center earns credit for making its form easy to find and for offering multiple request pathways including online portals. However, the PDF form itself is a generic, non-fillable ROI authorization that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The misleading email restriction and vague fee disclosure are compliance concerns. A patient can complete the process via fax or mail submission without visiting in person, which meets the baseline, but the lack of fillable fields and the form's dual-direction confusion reduce usability. The organization is adequate but not patient-centered in its PDF-based pathway.

# Lane County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lane County Hospital is a government-owned, independent critical access hospital in Dighton, Kansas. The facility offers a single pathway for medical records requests: a one-page PDF authorization form available on its website. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient self-access form.

## Available Pathways and Form Classification

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "Authorization for Release of Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for third-party release of information. It uses the standard disclosure structure — "I authorize [entity] to disclose... to [name]" — which frames the transaction as releasing records to someone other than the patient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the authorizing party and the recipient, navigating a form that was not designed with their use case in mind.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access requests and third-party authorization releases. There is no separate patient access request form, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 individual access rights, and no streamlined process for patients who simply want to review or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was exceptionally easy. A basic web search immediately identified the hospital's Records Request page, which contains a single "Click Here" link to the PDF. No login, bot blocking, or portal navigation was required. For a small rural hospital, this level of web accessibility is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally created PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscore lines, requiring the patient to print the form and complete it by hand (or use third-party PDF annotation tools). The form is one page long with a logical flow: patient identification at top, authorization body, 16 record-type checkboxes, legal disclosures, and signature block. The record-type checkboxes offer strong granularity — 16 categories from Anesthesia Records to Social Work Reports — giving patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.

The language is a mix of plain language and standard legal boilerplate. Some sentences are convoluted ("I understand that I may refuse to sign this Authorization and that my treatment of payment for my treatment will not be affected...") but the form is generally readable. The title contains a typo ("HEATH" instead of "HEALTH") that has persisted since at least 2018. "Psychotherapy Notes" appears twice in the checkbox list, and a cryptic "RESOURCE: MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FORM" reference at the bottom could confuse patients.

## Submission and Barriers

The form directs patients to return it via **fax** to one of two numbers. No email, mail, or online submission option is mentioned. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway.

Two unnecessary barriers stand out. First, the form requests a **Social Security Number**, which is not required for HIPAA-compliant release processing and creates identity theft risk on a form routinely transmitted by fax. Second, a **witness signature line** creates an implicit expectation that a witness is needed, though HIPAA does not require one for valid authorization. Together these add friction and potential deterrence for patients acting alone.

No fees are mentioned. The form includes solid compliance elements: an expiration field, a citation of Kansas SB 119's one-year authorization limit, and clear revocation instructions naming the Privacy Officer with full contact information.

## Overall Assessment

Lane County Hospital makes its records request form easy to find and keeps it concise at one page with good record-type granularity. However, the form funnels all requesters — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization designed for disclosure to others, not for individual access. The lack of fillable fields, the SSN request, and the witness signature line create unnecessary friction. For a small critical access hospital, the web accessibility is commendable, but the form itself reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-centered approach to individual access rights.

# Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital is part of **Cottage Health**, a regional nonprofit system serving the Santa Barbara/Goleta area of California. The hospital does not maintain its own ROI forms; instead, it uses Cottage Health's system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (Form NS1405). Three documents were retrieved: the current English form (Aug 2025), a complete Spanish translation (Form NS1406, Aug 2025), and a superseded English version (Jun 2025). Cottage Health also offers an online electronic request pathway via Swellbox, linked from the same medical records page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

The primary form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for all types of health information disclosure — to providers, insurers, attorneys, and the patient themselves. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. However, Section C includes a clear **"Patient (self)" checkbox**, so a patient requesting their own records can use the form without pretending to be a third party. The form's title ("Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information"), structure (redisclosure restrictions, recipient relationship fields), and framing are clearly built around the third-party release paradigm. A self-requesting patient must navigate sections that don't apply to them — recipient relationship, redisclosure restrictions — and there is no streamlined "I just want my own records" pathway on the PDF itself.

The **Swellbox online wizard** (linked from the medical records page) provides an alternative digital pathway that may be more patient-centric, though it was not evaluated in detail.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **straightforward**. The medical records page sits at a clear navigation path (Home > Patients & Visitors > Accessing Your Medical Records) and is well-organized. The main friction was technical: the primary website URLs are protected by Akamai CDN, which blocks programmatic downloads. Azure Blob Storage mirror URLs worked without issue. The website also hosted both June and August 2025 versions simultaneously, creating minor version-confusion risk. The older version remains live at its original URL with no "outdated" notice.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a **2-page, digitally-authored PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. Despite this, it has **zero fillable/interactive form fields**. All checkboxes and text blanks are static visual elements. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and then scan or photograph it for electronic submission. This contradicts the form's own statement that "VALID ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES WILL BE ACCEPTED" — the form signals digital readiness but doesn't deliver it.

The layout is well-organized with **nine lettered sections (A–I)**, each with clear headings, following a logical flow: patient info → record scope → recipient → delivery method → expiration → rights → restrictions → cost → signature. The language is **mostly plain**, with an accessible opening statement about the right to refuse. Some passages lean toward legalese (redisclosure restrictions in Section G). At approximately 15–18 fields, the scope is reasonable for the content covered.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Submission methods** are genuinely flexible: email (medicalrecords@sbch.org), fax, and mail are all accepted. No in-person requirement exists. Electronic signatures are explicitly accepted. **No notarization** is required.

**Fees** are vaguely disclosed: "There may be a fee for copies of medical records. You will be notified in advance." No fee schedule or amount is provided, and the waiver for provider-to-provider transfers could imply that patient self-requests do incur fees. The form commits to a **15-day turnaround**, faster than HIPAA's 30-day requirement.

One **red flag**: the opening warning that "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" could function as a barrier, potentially giving the organization grounds to reject incomplete but actionable requests. HIPAA does not permit denying access based on incomplete non-essential fields.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version**: A complete, professionally translated form (NS1406) — not a summary — demonstrating genuine linguistic accessibility for the Goleta/Santa Barbara community.
- **MyChart delivery option**: Patients can receive records directly through the patient portal, a modern approach many organizations lack.
- **Swellbox online alternative**: A fully digital request pathway exists alongside the PDF, giving patients a choice.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Email, fax, and mail all accepted — no physical visit required.
- **California sensitive-category handling**: Appropriate opt-in checkboxes for Mental Health, Chemical Dependency, HIV, and Reproductive Healthcare with state law citations.

## Overall Assessment

Cottage Health provides a **competent but not exemplary** patient access experience. The system earns credit for offering multiple pathways (PDF, Swellbox portal, email/fax submission), a Spanish translation, and MyChart delivery. However, the core form is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF undermines the digital workflow the system otherwise supports. The vague fee language and "invalidation" warning are minor compliance concerns. A patient can successfully request their own records through this system without undue hardship, but the process could be meaningfully improved with a patient-specific form and interactive PDF fields.

**Grade: B** — Good overall with room for improvement in patient-centeredness and technical accessibility of the PDF form.

# Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, a ScionHealth-affiliated for-profit community hospital in Hartsville, SC, offers two publicly available ROI forms: an English "Release of Information Authorization / Requisition Form" (form-1.pdf) and an identical Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are hosted on ScionHealth's CMS infrastructure and linked directly from the hospital's medical records page at cprmc.com/medical-records. No additional patient access forms, online portals, or digital request wizards were found. The hospital uses MRO Corp as its third-party ROI vendor for processing requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms structured around a "disclosing provider → recipient" model. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the "Name of Recipient" section with their own information — a workflow designed for third-party disclosure, not individual access. The form references 45 CFR 160 and 164 only in the context of redisclosure risk and never mentions HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524). There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no simplified self-request form, and no portal-based alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-specific web search immediately surfaced both PDF URLs, and the medical records page provides direct links alongside submission instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, or multi-click navigation was encountered. File names are descriptive (`Authorization_Update_(English).pdf`). This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — but with **zero fillable fields**. Every field must be completed by printing and handwriting. The layout is organized into two sections: Section A for patient and recipient demographics plus record type selection, and Section B for seven legal statements with a signature block. The 15-category record type checklist (face sheet, H&P, labs, imaging, etc.) with an "All Records" option provides good granularity. However, the single-page format forces dense layout with limited whitespace, and the legal statements use moderately complex language referencing CFR provisions. The form lacks instructions beyond section labels, provides no guidance on how patients will receive their records, and includes a "purpose/reason for this request" field without noting that HIPAA does not require patients to justify self-access requests.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable red flags emerge. First, Statement 6 states that patients "may need to have my physician authorize" the use or disclosure of sensitive information in their records — language that could function as an illegitimate barrier to patient access under HIPAA's Right of Access. Second, the "For Office Use Only" section includes a Social Security number field, creating unnecessary data exposure risk. The form discloses no fees, states no response timeline, and does not mention the MRO Corp third-party vendor relationship. On the positive side, no notarization is required, and submission channels include fax and email in addition to in-person delivery — adequate electronic submission options.

## Notable Strengths

The availability of a professionally translated Spanish-language form is a genuine bright spot, particularly for a community hospital. Both language versions are equally accessible from the medical records page. The granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control over their request scope. The easy online findability — direct links, descriptive URLs, no access barriers — represents a model for form availability.

## Overall Assessment

Carolina Pines provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and submit, and the Spanish translation is commendable. However, the lack of any patient self-access differentiation, zero fillable fields, concerning physician-gating language for sensitive records, and absence of fee or timeline transparency place this organization squarely in the middle tier. A patient can navigate this process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary audience.

# Synthesis: Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix

## Overview

Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix is part of Banner Health, a major nonprofit health system in the western United States. The facility uses Banner Health's system-wide forms for medical records release rather than maintaining its own. Two forms were found: a current system-wide authorization (form-1.pdf, revised 06/2025) and a legacy hospital-specific version (form-2.pdf, revised 09/2017). The current system-wide form is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Banner Health offers two pathways for record access: a downloadable PDF authorization form and a patient portal (Banner Health App / https://account.bannerhealth.com/). The current form (form-1.pdf) prominently notes at the top that patients can access most health information through the portal, which is a helpful redirect before a patient commits to the paper process. For records not available through the portal, the PDF form is the primary pathway. Submission options include mail, fax, and in-person pick-up — fax provides an adequate electronic submission method, though there is no online form submission or email-based submission option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Banner Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" documents designed to cover all release scenarios. The current form includes a "Self" checkbox under both the "Release/Send Information To" field and the "Purpose" field, acknowledging that patients may request their own records, but the form structure, language, and authorization requirements are identical regardless of who the records are going to. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same release-from/release-to paradigm, date range fields, record type checkboxes, and HIPAA authorization language that a third party would face. There is no simplified patient access request pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A straightforward web search returned the system-wide form immediately, and it is published on bannerhealth.com under the patients/medical-records section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA was encountered. Both forms were directly downloadable via curl. The coexistence of the current (2025) and legacy (2017) forms on the same website creates a minor risk that patients might download the outdated version, which lacks the portal callout and has less granular sensitive-information controls.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a flat, non-fillable PDF — zero interactive form fields despite being a born-digital document. A patient must print the form, handwrite all fields, sign it, and submit via mail, fax, or in-person. The form is 2 pages with approximately 20 fields to complete (patient demographics, release from/to addresses, date range, record type checkboxes, delivery preference, purpose, and signature). The layout is logically organized with clear section headers and a natural top-to-bottom flow. Record-type selection is granular with 12 specific categories plus an "Other" option.

Language is mixed: the opening paragraph about "third-party directives" is dense regulatory jargon that would confuse most patients, but the authorization statements on page 2 use accessible "I understand" framing. The sensitive information section uses an exclusion model — all sensitive data is included by default, with checkboxes to opt specific categories out. This is more protective than the legacy form's blanket consent but may still surprise patients who don't realize they must affirmatively opt out.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: The form warns "There may be a FEE associated with your Request for Records" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access fees (capped under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. This vagueness may deter patients from making requests.

**Liability waiver**: The form includes a broad release of Banner Health from "any legal responsibility or liability for the disclosure" — a clause that goes beyond standard HIPAA authorization requirements.

**No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature (or legal representative), which is appropriate.

**No in-person requirement**: Fax submission is available, so patients are not forced to visit the facility.

## Strengths

- **Patient portal callout**: The prominent opening line directing patients to the portal is a best practice that may eliminate the need for the paper form entirely for many patients.
- **Recent revision**: The 06/2025 revision date demonstrates active form maintenance.
- **Granular record selection**: 12 specific record categories give patients meaningful control.
- **Sensitive information opt-out**: Per-category exclusion checkboxes improve on the blanket consent approach.
- **Clear patient rights language**: Explicit statements about the right to refuse, non-conditioning of treatment, and right to revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Banner Health provides a findable, recently maintained, and reasonably well-designed authorization form, but it falls short of a truly patient-centered experience. The form funnels all requests — self-access and third-party — through the same generic authorization, the PDF is not fillable, and the fee disclosure is vague. The patient portal redirect is a genuine bright spot, but for patients who need the paper form, the experience is a standard paper-based workflow with no digital-first innovation. The organization earns credit for accessibility and active maintenance but loses ground on technical modernization and pathway differentiation.

# Tioga Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Tioga Medical Center, a small independent critical access hospital in Tioga, North Dakota, offers a single ROI form: an "Authorization for Release of Medical/Confidential Information" available from its Health Information Management (HIM) page at https://www.tiogahealth.org/him. The form is provided in both PDF and Word (.docx) formats. No patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form exists. The only submission options apparent from the form are fax (701-664-2646) and mail (P.O. Box 159, Tioga, ND 58852).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Tioga Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form uses a "Release From" / "Release To" structure that assumes records are moving between facilities or to a third party — not to the patient themselves. A patient requesting their own records would need to awkwardly list themselves in the "Release To" field, navigating a paradigm that was never designed for them. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no dedicated patient access pathway, and no guidance on how patients requesting their own records should complete the form. This is a textbook example of the "wrong form" problem: the organization funnels all requesters through a generic authorization form built for inter-institutional disclosure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the HIM page, and the form is directly linked with no login required. For a small critical access hospital, this represents reasonable discoverability. The only minor issue is that the download URL is a Wix-generated hash path that gives no indication of the document's content, and the HIM page provides little context about when or why a patient would use this form.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is an **image-only scan** — a CCITT fax-encoded grayscale image at 200 DPI with zero text layer, zero fillable fields, and zero embedded fonts. It is completely inaccessible to screen readers and fails basic digital accessibility standards. A patient must print the form and fill it out by hand. The availability of a Word (.docx) version partially mitigates this: a patient with Microsoft Word could type into the document, but this depends on having compatible software and the initiative to seek out the alternative format.

The form itself is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics, release-from/to facility information, date range, purpose checkboxes (6 options), record type checkboxes (12 categories), sensitive records authorization, and signature lines. The 12 checkbox categories for record types — from emergency room records to clinic notes — provide genuinely useful granularity. However, a dense legal paragraph at the bottom covers revocation rights, insurance implications, and re-disclosure warnings in a single unbroken block with no visual emphasis on key patient rights.

## Barriers and Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — while not explicitly marked as required, its presence as a structured field implies it is expected. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests, and this could deter patients who lack someone available to witness. The form mentions no fees, states no response timeline, and provides no delivery format options (electronic, CD, mail). An internal tracking sidebar ("Records given □ / Number of Pages / Initials") sits unlabeled among patient-facing fields, creating potential confusion.

## Strengths

Despite its limitations, the form has some positive elements: a clear voluntariness statement ("I can refuse to sign this authorization. I need not sign this form in order to assure treatment"), explicit revocation rights, a reasonable six-month authorization window, and granular record-type selection. The dual-format availability (PDF + Word) shows some awareness of accessibility needs, even if the execution is lacking.

## Overall Assessment

Tioga Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request process that reflects the resource constraints typical of small independent critical access hospitals. The form is easy to find and covers the basics, but it is technically primitive (image-only scan), not designed for patient self-access, and includes a potentially unnecessary witness requirement. A patient could navigate this process, but they would need to print the form, handwrite their information, figure out that they belong in the "Release To" field, and fax or mail it back. The organization earns a **C grade** — adequate findability cannot fully compensate for poor technical accessibility and a form paradigm that treats patient self-access as an afterthought.

# Western Washington Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Everett, WA. Three ROI-related documents were retrieved: a primary organization-wide fillable authorization form (form-1), a GI department-specific non-fillable release form (form-2), and a generic unbranded authorization hosted on PatientPop (form-3). Form-1 is clearly the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records and is the basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WWMG does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Western Washington Medical Group to RELEASE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION" — a standard third-party release authorization. Patients requesting their own records use the same form as those authorizing release to an attorney, insurer, or another provider. "Personal (to patient)" appears as one of several purpose checkboxes, annotated with "*service fee may apply." There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal option for record requests. The form does not reference the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish individual access rights from third-party authorization. A patient must navigate a form designed around sending records to someone else and adapt it for self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search returned direct PDF links, and WWMG maintains a dedicated Medical Records Request page (wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/) that links to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or portal requirements were encountered. The URL is descriptive and the form is also listed on the Patient Intake and Registration Forms page. The only complication is the existence of three forms — a patient could potentially encounter the inferior GI-specific (form-2) or orphaned PatientPop form (form-3) instead of the primary one, though the website clearly surfaces form-1.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a single-page fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — well above average for healthcare ROI forms. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → record scope → sensitive information exclusions → purpose → expiration → signature. The language is relatively plain, with direct instructions like "PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE." The scope options are strong, offering four ways to define what records are released (all within 3 years, specific condition, specific dates, or mutual exchange). The sensitive information exclusion section gives patients granular control over HIV, STD, psychiatric, and substance abuse records using an opt-out model with required initials.

The form is not a scan — it was designed digitally with clean text, multiple fonts, and embedded branding. At 143 KB for a single page, it is appropriately sized. WWMG's address is pre-filled, reducing patient burden.

## Submission and Delivery

The form directs patients to "visit wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request and refer to the contact info on the chart" for submission instructions, rather than listing submission options directly on the form. The "OFFICE USE ONLY" section indicates records can be faxed, mailed, or emailed — confirming electronic submission pathways exist. This indirect approach adds a step but avoids restricting patients to in-person delivery. Fax availability means patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or witness signature is required. However, two issues stand out:

1. **Vague fee language**: The "*service fee may apply" note next to "Personal (to patient)" is concerning. HIPAA limits fees for patient access to reasonable, cost-based amounts, and this language provides no specifics, potentially discouraging patients or leading to overcharging.

2. **Misleading "ALL" scope**: The "ALL healthcare information" option is silently limited to the last 3 years. A patient seeking their complete history must use the "Specific DATES" option, but this limitation is not explained. The word "ALL" is misleading.

The 90-day default authorization expiration is adequate for patient access requests (HIPAA requires fulfillment within 30 days with one extension) but creates unnecessary re-authorization burden for ongoing provider exchanges. A conflicting 1-year expiration for the "mutual exchange" option adds confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — genuinely digital-first design
- Single-page format that fits all necessary elements concisely
- Strong scope options with granular sensitive-information exclusion controls
- Multi-clinic awareness field routing requests to the correct WWMG location
- Easy-to-find forms with a dedicated Medical Records Request page

## Overall Assessment

WWMG provides a technically competent, well-designed authorization form that is easy to find and fill out digitally. However, it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — patients must navigate a generic authorization form and select the "Personal" purpose checkbox. The vague fee language for patient access is a compliance concern. The form's document quality and digital-first design are above average, but the lack of a patient-centered access pathway keeps this from being an exemplary practice.

# UPMC Presbyterian — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

UPMC Presbyterian uses the system-wide UPMC "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (form-1.pdf), a two-page PDF hosted on UPMC's Digital Asset Management CDN. Two additional documents were found: an In-Home Urgent Care variant (form-2.pdf) for home-based care services, and an informational guide (form-3.pdf) that walks patients through completing the main form. The primary form relevant to a patient at UPMC Presbyterian requesting their own hospital records is form-1.pdf.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UPMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to physicians, insurers, attorneys, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form used for third-party release, selecting "Personal Use" as the purpose and listing themselves as the recipient. However, UPMC does include a notable inline annotation: **"Purpose is not required for patient access,"** a clear acknowledgment of HIPAA individual access rights that most organizations omit. This partially bridges the gap, but the form's structure — "I authorize UPMC to release information to: [Facility/Person to Receive Records]" — remains fundamentally oriented toward release to third parties. There is no separate patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a MyChart-based records request workflow in the materials reviewed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links on UPMC's CDN. The form is prominently linked from both the system-wide medical records page and the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page. No bot blocking, broken links, or login requirements were encountered. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a **born-digital but print-first PDF**. Despite being created digitally (22 embedded fonts, not a scan), it has essentially no fillable fields — only 1 unnamed interactive field was detected across the entire document. All data entry points use underscore-style blank lines and checkbox squares intended for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit it via mail or fax.

The form is **extremely dense**. Page 1 packs facility selection (14+ UPMC hospitals), patient demographics, recipient information, purpose, disclosure format, delivery method, record type selection (20+ specific document types), sensitive-information opt-outs, expiration terms, and signature blocks onto a single page. While the logical flow is sound (sections labeled A through C), the tight spacing and small text create a visually overwhelming experience. Page 2 contains patient rights and responsibilities disclosures.

The language mixes plain English with legal terminology. Instructions like "Parts 1 and 2 below must be completed" are clear, but fee language and re-disclosure warnings are dense. The 20+ record-type checkboxes offer impressive granularity but may overwhelm patients who simply want "all my records."

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Fee language is ambiguous for patient access.** The form states "charges may be associated with this request" citing Pennsylvania state law, without distinguishing patient access (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) from third-party requests. The phrase "records will be sent upon receipt of payment" could be read as conditioning access on pre-payment.
- **90-day default authorization expiration** is unusually short and may force resubmission if processing is slow, though patients can specify up to one year.
- **No fillable fields** despite born-digital creation is a missed opportunity that forces a paper workflow.
- **Fax delivery restricted to "Providers Only"** — patients cannot receive records by fax, though email and Direct Address are available as electronic delivery alternatives.

## Notable Strengths

- **Companion instruction guide** (form-3.pdf) is a rare patient-friendly resource that explains each section with plain-language examples (e.g., "Inpatient: Admitted for treatment or surgery with overnight stay in hospital").
- **"Purpose is not required for patient access"** — an unusually clear inline acknowledgment of HIPAA rights.
- **Email and Direct Address delivery options** demonstrate awareness of digital access preferences.
- **Anti-conditioning statement** explicitly states UPMC will not condition treatment on signing.
- **Oral authorization provision** for patients physically unable to sign, with two-witness requirements.

## Overall Assessment

UPMC Presbyterian provides an accessible, findable ROI form with some genuinely patient-friendly features — particularly the companion guide and the "purpose not required" note. However, the organization funnels all record requests through a single generic authorization form that was designed for third-party release, lacks interactive form fields despite being born-digital, and uses ambiguous fee language that doesn't clearly distinguish patient access rights. The result is a process that a motivated patient can navigate but that was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. For a major academic health system, the lack of any digital-first submission pathway (online portal, fillable PDF, or web form) is a notable gap.

# The Baton Rouge Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

The Baton Rouge Clinic maintains three distinct medical records forms on a well-organized "Downloadable Forms" page: (1) an outbound release authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information FROM The Baton Rouge Clinic"), (2) an inbound transfer authorization ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information TO The Baton Rouge Clinic"), and (3) a "Right of Access Form" citing HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 164.524. This three-form strategy shows unusual thoughtfulness — the clinic has differentiated between outbound third-party release, inbound records transfer, and patient-directed access, which is more than most organizations offer.

## Patient Self-Access Pathway

The Right of Access form (form-3) is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. At just one page and ~1,300 characters, it is admirably concise compared to the two-page authorization forms. It explicitly cites HIPAA Right of Access authority and offers a choice between electronic and hard copy delivery — a genuine bright spot that many organizations lack.

However, the form has a meaningful design flaw: it is framed entirely as a designee authorization, directing providers to disclose records "to: Name: ___." There is no clear option for a patient to request records for themselves; a patient wanting their own records would need to awkwardly write their own name in the recipient field. The form that most directly invokes the Right of Access isn't actually designed for the most common Right of Access use case — patient self-request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. A web search immediately returned direct PDF links to the authorization forms. All three forms were hosted on a well-organized downloadable forms page at `batonrougeclinic.com/patient-information/downloadable-forms/` with no login, CAPTCHA, or JavaScript rendering required. The one findability gap: the Right of Access form (form-3) was not surfaced by the initial web search and was only discovered by browsing the forms page directly. A patient searching specifically for "how to request my records" might land on the third-party release form instead.

## Form Document Quality

All three forms are flat PDFs with zero fillable fields, despite having clean text layers (not scans). Every form requires printing and hand-filling — a significant accessibility gap, particularly ironic for form-3, which explicitly offers electronic record delivery while requiring a paper submission process. Form-3 has a clean, simple layout with logical flow (patient name → designee → scope → format → duration → signature). The language is relatively plain and accessible. Form-1 uses an asterisk system to mark required fields, which is helpful, though it also requires a Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection burden that form-3 wisely avoids.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. None of the forms disclose fees or state response times. Form-1 includes a hold-harmless clause that goes beyond HIPAA requirements, though form-3 omits this — a more patient-friendly approach. Submission methods are poorly documented: form-1 provides a medical records email (medrecords@brclinic.com) and phone number for questions and urgent requests, but no form explicitly states how to submit the completed document. No fax number is provided. The mailing address appears in footers. A patient completing form-3 has no guidance on where or how to send it.

## Overall Assessment

The Baton Rouge Clinic demonstrates above-average organizational thinking about patient access — the three-form strategy and HIPAA Right of Access citation reflect genuine awareness of different use cases. The Right of Access form's conciseness and electronic delivery option are bright spots. However, the execution falls short in key areas: all forms lack fillable fields, submission pathways are unclear, and the Right of Access form's designee-only framing creates a confusing gap for patients seeking their own records. The clinic has the right structure but needs better implementation — fillable fields, explicit submission instructions, and a self-access option on the Right of Access form would substantially improve the patient experience.

# Nevada Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Nevada Health Centers (NHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Carson City, NV. The organization publishes three ROI-related forms on a well-organized patient forms page. All three are bilingual English/Spanish PDFs created in Adobe Illustrator, and none have fillable fields or an extractable text layer. The primary form for patient self-access is a general-purpose "Release of Medical Information" authorization — there is no dedicated patient access request form.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved from the forms page at `nevadahealthcenters.org/forms/`:

1. **Form-1** — "Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). This is the primary general-purpose release form, covering both patient-initiated requests and third-party releases via a "To/From" checkbox. It is the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records.
2. **Form-2** — "Authorization to Share Information" (2 pages, bilingual EN/ES). This is a proxy access designation form allowing patients to authorize family or friends to access information on their behalf. It does *not* serve patient self-access.
3. **Form-3** — "WIC Release of Medical Information" (1 page, bilingual EN/ES). A WIC program-specific variant of Form-1, listing seven WIC clinic locations. Structurally identical to Form-1 with added clinic details.

The organization directs completed forms to its Support Services Department in Las Vegas. Fax numbers appear on the forms (and specifically on Form-3's clinic listings), and a mailing address is provided on Form-1. No online portal, email submission, or patient portal-based records request was identified.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NHC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Form-1 uses a single "To or From" directional checkbox to handle both scenarios. A patient requesting their own records would check "To" (themselves) and provide their own contact information in the recipient fields — but the form's language and structure are oriented toward third-party release, asking for a recipient's name, address, phone, and fax. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524, the Right of Access, or any patient rights language beyond revocation rights. The form requires a "Reason for Request" (with options including "Personal"), which HIPAA does not require for patient self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **relatively easy**. A site-scoped search (`site:nevadahealthcenters.org`) identified the forms page within 2–3 steps. The page is well-organized by category (General Forms, Dental Forms, Mammovan Forms, etc.) with clearly labeled PDF links. However, generic web searches did not surface NHC-specific forms — results returned other Nevada healthcare organizations instead. A patient would need to navigate directly to the NHC website to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a clean, single-page design that packs bilingual content, multiple checkbox sections, and a signature block into a reasonably organized layout. The top-to-bottom flow is logical: patient identification → direction of release → record types → date range → confidential information → reason → signature.

However, significant technical and design issues undermine usability:

- **No fillable fields and no text layer**: All three PDFs were created in Adobe Illustrator with text rendered as vector paths. They have zero extractable text, zero embedded fonts, and zero interactive fields. Screen readers cannot read them, text cannot be copied or searched, and every field must be hand-filled after printing. This is an especially unfortunate choice because the documents are born-digital (not scans) — a word processor or PDF form tool would have preserved accessibility.
- **No "All Records" checkbox**: The form offers six specific record categories plus "Other" but lacks an option to request a complete record. A patient exercising their Right of Access to their full designated record set must check every box and potentially write additional categories.
- **Ambiguous witness line**: The signature block includes a "Witness" field without indicating whether it is required or optional, potentially creating a perceived barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **Inline bilingual compression**: English and Spanish share space on a single page, which keeps things concise but subordinates the Spanish text and reduces whitespace.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers**: No notarization is required. No fees are mentioned (neither disclosed nor explicitly waived). The 120-day default expiration is reasonable but on the shorter side. The witness field ambiguity is a minor concern. The primary barriers are technical: the completely non-digital workflow (print, handwrite, fax/mail) and the inaccessible PDF format.

**Bright spots**: The bilingual English/Spanish design across all three forms is a genuine strength for this FQHC's patient population. The granular confidential information opt-in/opt-out section (AIDS/HIV, behavioral health, alcohol/drug, social services) gives patients meaningful control over sensitive categories. The single-page form length is appropriately concise.

## Overall Assessment

Nevada Health Centers provides a findable, bilingual, concisely designed release form that a patient *can* use to request their own records — but the process was not designed with patient self-access in mind. The generic authorization form, the print-only workflow, and the complete lack of digital accessibility represent a paper-era approach that creates unnecessary friction. The organization earns credit for easy findability and inclusive bilingual design, but loses ground on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness. Overall grade: **C**.

# Emory University Hospital — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Emory University Hospital, part of the Emory Healthcare system, offers four documents on its medical records page: a current English ROI authorization form (form-1, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), a legacy 4-page ROI package (form-2, ~September 2022), a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), and a Request for Amendment form (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting records is form-1, the current English authorization. Emory also provides a Swellbox/Datavant online records request wizard as an alternative digital pathway.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Emory does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release authorization. The primary form is a generic "Authorization for the Release of Protected Health Information" used for all release scenarios — patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties all use the same document. However, the form does include "At my request" as a named purpose option, and its delivery methods include MyChart and EHI Export, signaling awareness that patients are a key audience. A patient requesting their own records must fill themselves in as the recipient, navigating a form framework designed around the third-party release paradigm. The Swellbox portal offers a somewhat more guided digital alternative, but the overall process does not clearly distinguish HIPAA Right of Access requests from general authorization-based releases.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A targeted web search for Emory Healthcare medical records forms surfaced the PDF URL directly, and the medical records page at `emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records` is well-organized with clear links to all relevant documents — English and Spanish authorization forms, fee sheets, e-delivery instructions, amendment form, and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed. The descriptive filename convention (`english-authorization-form-fillable-revised-11-2025.pdf`) is a small but meaningful usability detail. One minor issue: the URL path includes a `/wr/` segment (likely referencing the Warner Robins facility), which could confuse patients at other Emory locations.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely fillable 2-page PDF with approximately 100 interactive fields (checkboxes and text inputs), though the PDF's AES-256 encryption caused metadata tools to report zero fillable fields. The form is organized into numbered sections covering facility selection (18+ Emory Healthcare locations), recipient and delivery information, record type specification (17+ granular checkboxes with date fields), and purpose. The layout is clean and logical. Language is a mix of clear structural labels and moderately dense legal text on page 2 (revocation rights, re-disclosure warnings, sensitive information waiver). The form is not tagged for screen reader accessibility.

A notable strength is the range of delivery options: paper, CD, USB drive, MyChart, mail, pick-up, e-delivery website, email, and — remarkably — **EHI Export**, a forward-thinking option that very few organizations surface on their authorization forms. The Spanish-language version (form-3) mirrors the English structure, though it has character encoding issues (accented characters rendering as digits) and incomplete translation of institutional terms.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. No in-person submission requirement exists — patients can fax or use the Swellbox portal. The primary form does not disclose fees directly; a separate fee sheet ($6.50 flat for electronic delivery, $0.07/page for paper) is available on the medical records page. The legacy form-2 required a separate fee acknowledgment signature, but the current form-1 does not. The form does include a blanket waiver for sensitive information (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health) that does not allow patients to opt out of releasing specific sensitive categories — a common but patient-unfriendly approach.

## Overall Assessment

Emory Healthcare provides a competent, well-organized records request process with several standout features — particularly the EHI Export delivery option, the Spanish-language form, and the Swellbox online portal. The forms are easy to find, fillable, and recently updated. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must use the same generic authorization form as third-party requesters, without clear guidance on how to request their own records specifically. The form accommodates patient requests but was not designed around them as a first-class use case. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and well-maintained, but not yet patient-centered in its design philosophy.

# Hartford Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hartford Hospital is part of Hartford HealthCare (HHC), a regional nonprofit health system in Connecticut. For medical records requests, the organization uses the system-wide "Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information" form (HH Forms 571559, Rev. 11-2022), a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all 11 HHC facilities. Three PDF documents were retrieved: the system-wide form hosted on two different HHC domains (form-1 and form-3, which are textually identical), and an older Institute of Living–specific variant from 2012 (form-2). The primary form for a patient seeking their own records is form-1.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Route

Hartford Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The system-wide form is a general-purpose authorization designed equally for third-party release (to insurers, attorneys, other providers) and patient self-access. The form's structure — "I authorize _____ to disclose/obtain health information to: ______" — is fundamentally oriented around third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must puzzle over which blank to fill with the hospital's name and which with their own.

The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient" as one checkbox alongside "Medical," "Legal," "Disability," and "Insurance," correctly marked as "(Optional)." But the form offers no simplified pathway, no separate section, and no explanatory text for patients exercising their Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524. The patient must navigate the same form and fields designed for attorneys and insurance companies.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The parent system's medical records page at `hartfordhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/patients/medical-records` is well-organized and links directly to the authorization form. However, a patient starting at `hartfordhospital.org` must navigate to the parent system's site. A previously indexed URL for the form now returns a 404 error, meaning patients following older search results or bookmarks encounter a dead link. The current URL uses an opaque numeric filename (`571559.pdf`) that gives no indication of the document's contents.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised in November 2022, every field is rendered as static underscored blank lines. A patient must print the form and complete it by hand — or use a PDF annotation tool as a workaround. For a major regional health system, the absence of any interactive form fields is a significant missed opportunity.

The layout is dense but logically organized: patient identification → source/destination → delivery method → record types → purpose → rights/signature. However, the form opens with staff-facing administrative fields (MR#, Date Completed, Pages Copied, Initials) that have no relevance to patients and may cause confusion. The record type section offers 19 checkbox options — useful granularity for specificity but potentially overwhelming for patients who simply want "my records." Sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse, reproductive health) are appropriately broken out with corresponding legal notices on page 2.

The language is moderately legalistic. The opening sentence is a dense multi-clause construction that packs in references to mental illness, substance abuse, HIV, and reproductive services. Page 2's legal notices contain typographical errors ("If the event" instead of "In the event") and inconsistent capitalization.

## Submission Methods and Barriers

The form lists fax numbers and mailing addresses for all 11 HHC facilities, making submission by fax or mail straightforward. There is no email address, web portal, or online submission option. Fax qualifies as an adequate electronic pathway per our scoring baseline.

**No notarization or witness is required.** No fees are mentioned on the form. The form correctly states that treatment is not conditioned on signing the authorization, and that the patient may inspect or copy their information. The purpose field is correctly marked optional.

## Bright Spots

- **Comprehensive facility directory**: All 11 HHC facilities listed with addresses and fax numbers as checkboxes, eliminating the common pain point of not knowing where to send the form.
- **Connecticut-specific protections**: Detailed legal notice blocks for HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, and reproductive health records, citing applicable state and federal law.
- **Purpose marked optional**: Correctly implements the HIPAA principle that patients need not justify access requests.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Separate checkboxes for specially protected categories give patients granular control.

## Red Flags

- **Stale URL returning 404**: Older links to the form lead to a dead end.
- **Confusing dual-purpose "disclose/obtain" structure**: Patients must determine which direction of information flow applies to them.
- **"Electronic" delivery undefined**: Listed as an option with no explanation of what it means in practice.
- **Typographical errors**: Multiple instances of "If the event" instead of "In the event" on page 2.

## Overall Assessment

Hartford Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request experience. The system-wide form covers the basics and includes appropriate compliance language, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of a dedicated patient access pathway, and generic third-party authorization structure all represent missed opportunities to serve patients well. The form is a C-grade experience: a patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them in mind.

# Michigan Medicine – University of Michigan Health: Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Michigan Medicine provides three publicly available forms related to medical records, though only one is relevant for patient self-access. **Form-1** (70-10015, VER: A/24) is the current "Authorization to Release Copies of a Medical Record," a 3-page document that serves as the primary ROI form for both patient self-requests and third-party releases. **Form-2** is an outdated 2011 version of the same form, still indexed on the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain — a housekeeping gap that could confuse patients. **Form-3** is an inbound records request form (authorizing Michigan Medicine to pull records from other providers), unrelated to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves dual purposes, but it does meaningfully differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Item 2 provides a dedicated "Myself" checkbox with delivery options tailored to patients (Patient Portal, electronic email web link, US Mail), while item 3 handles third-party recipients with its own delivery methods. This structural separation gives patients a clear path without needing to decode which sections apply to them. Additionally, the form prominently promotes the **MyUofMHealth Patient Portal** as a free, zero-cost delivery channel — a strong nudge toward the most convenient option. However, the form remains fundamentally an authorization rather than a dedicated patient access request, and the fee schedule and prepayment language do not clearly exempt patient self-requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search for Michigan Medicine's ROI form immediately returned direct links to the current PDF on `uofmhealth.org`. No site navigation was required. The download was unobstructed — no CAPTCHAs or bot blocking on the primary domain (though the legacy `medicine.umich.edu` domain had Cloudflare challenges). The one annoyance is the uninformative filename (`ROI_.pdf`).

## Form Document Quality

The form has a proper text layer and clean digital design — it is not a scan. However, despite the full text layer, **no fillable/interactive PDF fields exist** (metadata confirms `fillable_field_count: 0`). A patient must print and handwrite or use a PDF annotation tool. For submission, fax (734-936-8571) and mail are available; notably, **no walk-in services** are offered — a departure from the 2011 version which accepted in-person delivery at any registration desk.

The layout uses numbered sections (1–9) that follow a logical progression: voluntariness statement → patient info → self/third-party selection → purpose → record set → expiration → revocation → signature → fees. The **package-based record selection** system is a genuine bright spot: instead of requiring patients to specify individual record types, it offers pre-built packages (Package 1: Key Clinical Documentation; Package 2: All Clinical Documentation) mapped to common purposes. This simplifies what is typically one of the most confusing parts of any ROI form.

Language is bureaucratic but generally comprehensible. Legal disclosures (voluntariness, revocation rights, re-disclosure risks) are clearly stated. Some passages are dense, particularly the insurance authorization exception clause. The fee schedule on page 3 is presented as a clear table with a helpful "No Cost Services" sidebar.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are disclosed transparently: portal access is free, electronic delivery to patients costs $6.89, and third-party requests incur higher per-page fees. The $6.89 patient fee is close to HIPAA's cost-based guidance but not explicitly justified as cost-based. More concerning is the prepayment language — "Some records requested for legal, insurance, or personal use may require a prepayment" — where "personal use" could be read to include patient self-requests, potentially conflicting with HIPAA's prohibition on conditioning access on payment.

The authorization defaults to a 60-day expiration, which is relatively short given the stated turnaround of 5–7 business days (with a caveat to "allow up to 30 days"). Turnaround time discrepancies between pages 2 and 3 add confusion. The form also names **Vital Chart (VRC)** as the third-party vendor handling records fulfillment — a transparency bright spot that sets patient expectations for communications from an unfamiliar sender.

## Overall Assessment

Michigan Medicine provides a competent, moderately patient-centered records request process. The form is well-organized, the package system simplifies record selection, and the portal promotion guides patients toward a free pathway. However, the lack of fillable PDF fields, the ambiguous prepayment language, and the elimination of walk-in services create friction. The continued availability of the outdated 2011 form is a minor but avoidable risk. This is a solid B-level experience: functional and accessible, with room for improvement in digital form design and compliance clarity.

# Springhill Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms & Pathways

Springhill Medical Center provides two downloadable documents from its Medical Records page: a single-page "Request for Release of Health Information" authorization form (form-1.pdf) and a generic ONC patient rights infographic (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is an actionable authorization form. The organization's Medical Records page also links to a **Zoho-based online ROI request portal** operated by MedRecs Management, and mentions a patient portal. The HIM department accepts fax submissions at 251.410.4014.

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

Springhill does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole authorization form uses a generic structure — "I hereby authorize ___ to release the following information to ___" — designed for third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in the hospital as the source and themselves as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that individual access requests have different legal requirements than third-party authorizations. The Zoho portal may offer a more tailored digital workflow, but the downloadable form funnels all requesters through a single generic pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A simple web search returned the PDF directly, and the organization's Medical Records page clearly links to both the form and the Zoho portal. No bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. However, the form URL embeds "2011-Version-1" in the filename, raising immediate questions about currency.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** — no interactive fields, no clickable checkboxes, just underscore blanks and bracket-style checkboxes requiring print-and-handwrite completion. At one page, the length is reasonable, and the logical flow (demographics → authorization → record types → delivery method → legal language → signature) is sound. However, the form is visually dated and dense, cramming all content onto a single page with small text. The language is a mix of functional and legal — mostly accessible but with a dense legal block at the bottom covering revocability, sensitive information categories, and redisclosure warnings.

The form requests approximately 20–25 fields including patient demographics, record type selections, delivery method details, and signatures. Notably, it asks for the patient's **Social Security Number**, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates a significant privacy risk.

## Barriers & Concerns

Several barriers stand out:

- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers for a medical records request creates unnecessary privacy risk, especially for forms submitted via fax or email.
- **Witness signature line**: The form includes a "Signature of Witness" field, implying a witness may be required — an unnecessary barrier with no HIPAA basis for patient-initiated requests.
- **Sensitive information bundling**: Substance abuse, psychiatric, STD, and HIV/AIDS records are bundled into the general authorization without separate opt-in, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2.
- **Outdated references**: The form still uses the legacy name "Springhill Memorial Hospital" and references "UB-92" (replaced by UB-04 in 2007), signaling a form that has not been updated in over a decade.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods**: The 2011-era form offers five delivery options — pick-up, mail, fax, patient portal, and email — which was forward-looking for its time.
- **Online portal availability**: The Zoho-based electronic request portal provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.
- **Patient rights education**: Hosting the ONC patient rights infographic shows awareness of patient access rights, even if the resource is generic.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: The form explicitly states that treatment and payment cannot be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Springhill Medical Center provides a functional but dated pathway for records access. The form is easy to find and offers multiple submission methods including fax and email, but the authorization form itself is a 15-year-old, non-fillable generic release form that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party disclosure. The SSN requirement and witness signature line create unnecessary barriers. The existence of a Zoho-based online portal is a meaningful positive, offering patients a digital alternative — though the downloadable form itself reflects a process that has not been meaningfully updated since 2011. A patient can get their records through this organization, but the experience requires navigating a form not designed for them.

# Medical City Dallas Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Medical City Dallas Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare's Medical City Healthcare division, provides patients with a single system-wide authorization form for requesting health records. The form is available in both English and Spanish as fillable PDFs linked from the hospital's medical records webpage. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients requesting their own records use the same generic HIPAA authorization form designed for all release-of-information scenarios, including third-party disclosures.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were retrieved, both hosted on HCA's digital asset management platform (`hcadam.com`):

- **Form 1** (English): HCA-840-00434, Rev. 09/21 — "Authorization for Release of PHI (Protected Health Information)." A 1-page fillable PDF with 52 interactive fields.
- **Form 2** (Spanish): HCA-840-00434-S — Direct Spanish translation of Form 1, with identical structure and 52 fillable fields.

Both forms are general-purpose release authorizations. The purpose-of-disclosure field offers "At the request of the individual" as one option alongside "Other 3rd party recipient," but the form does not distinguish between patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) and third-party authorization. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission wizard.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required navigating the hospital website to the medical records page (`/locations/medical-city-dallas-hospital/for-patients/medical-records`). Direct web searches returned stale 404 URLs from a previous hosting location (`medicalcityhealthcare.com/util/forms/`), with no redirects in place. Once on the correct page, the forms are clearly labeled and directly downloadable. No bot blocking or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed, born-digital PDF — not a scan. All 52 fields are interactive and fillable on-screen, eliminating the need for handwriting. The single-page format is efficient but extremely dense: patient demographics, recipient information, four delivery options (paper, electronic media, encrypted email, unencrypted email), 16+ record-type checkboxes, a six-point disclosure statement, psychotherapy notes handling, marketing/sale of PHI questions, and a signature block are all compressed into one page. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — functional for most adults but potentially challenging for low-literacy readers.

The form provides clear section headers (A, B, C) and logically groups related fields. Instructions are implicit in the form structure rather than stated separately. The consent statements correctly cover voluntary authorization, revocation rights, and non-conditioning of treatment — standard HIPAA requirements. The form mentions a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying an amount.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests the last 4 digits of SSN, marked "(optional)." While optional, collecting SSN on an ROI form is unnecessary for patient identification and creates a data exposure risk.
- **Centralized processing**: All requests go to HCA headquarters in Nashville (PO Box 290789), not to the local hospital. A patient expecting to deal with Medical City Dallas directly may find this confusing.
- **Fax restriction**: Fax delivery is limited to "Physician Office / Medical facility," which could restrict a patient's ability to receive records via fax at a non-medical location.
- **No online submission**: The form must be printed, signed, and mailed or faxed to Nashville. There is no portal-based or email submission option. However, fax submission is available (844-481-0298), meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language version**: A fully translated Spanish form with identical structure and fillable fields, linked with Spanish-language text from the same page — a meaningful accessibility feature for Dallas's large Spanish-speaking population.
- **USCDI release option**: The form includes a forward-looking option for USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability) release requests, acknowledging modern health data exchange standards. This is rare among ROI forms.
- **52 fillable fields**: Comprehensive digital interactivity means the entire form can be completed on-screen before printing for signature.
- **Four delivery format options**: Paper, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients genuine choice.

## Overall Assessment

Medical City Dallas Hospital, via its parent HCA Healthcare, provides a technically competent ROI form that is fillable, multilingual, and reasonably well-organized. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — there is no dedicated patient access pathway. The form is a generic authorization that serves all purposes. Findability is hampered by broken legacy URLs, and the centralized Nashville processing model may confuse local patients. The form's document quality is solid (fillable, clear sections, multiple delivery options), but the lack of a patient-centric access pathway and the optional SSN field are notable shortcomings. The organization earns a mid-range assessment: technically adequate with meaningful strengths in multilingual access and digital form quality, but falling short on patient-centeredness and access pathway design.

# Vanderbilt University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

Vanderbilt Health offers patients multiple pathways to request their medical records. The official medical records page at vanderbilthealth.com lists both downloadable PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish) and three online portals: a **Swellbox patient request portal**, a Swellbox provider request portal, and a ChartSwap third-party request portal. The separation of these portals by requester type — patient, provider, and third party — is a meaningful structural differentiator that many organizations lack.

Five PDF documents were discovered across Vanderbilt web properties. The current official English form is **form-4.pdf** (VMR 3017, dated 10/2023), a 2-page authorization linked from the main medical records page. Form-5 is its Spanish translation. Forms 1 and 2 are older versions (2022 and 2017 respectively) still publicly hosted on VUMC subdomains with no deprecation notice. Form-3 is an incoming-records form (release TO Vanderbilt) irrelevant to patient self-access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Vanderbilt partially differentiates individual access from third-party release. At the portal level, the separation is clear: patients, providers, and third parties each have distinct Swellbox/ChartSwap entry points. However, at the PDF form level, Vanderbilt uses a single generic "Authorization for the Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" — a HIPAA § 164.508 authorization form doing double duty for patient access requests that should technically fall under § 164.524 Right of Access. The form does correctly scope the purpose question in Section 8, noting it is only required "if not for your personal use," which recognizes patient self-access as the default. But the overall framing ("I hereby give Vanderbilt Health permission to disclose my individually identifiable protected health information") miscasts a patient right as a permission grant.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. The official vanderbilthealth.com medical records page clearly links both the English and Spanish PDFs under "Request Records by Authorization Form," and all downloads succeeded without bot blocking or login walls. The primary findability concern is that **outdated versions persist** on VUMC subdomains (student health, information privacy & security) — a patient searching Google could land on the 2017 or 2022 version, which has different fee structures, fewer facilities, and old branding, with no indication it's superseded.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4 is compact and well-organized, condensed from the older 4-page format to 2 pages with 10 numbered sections and clear bold headers. However, it is fundamentally an **image-only scan** — zero fillable fields, only 61 characters of extractable text, and no screen-reader accessibility. A patient must print it, complete it by hand, and submit via mail or fax. The electronic delivery option described in Section 4 (PDF through a request portal, directions sent to email) is a genuine patient-friendly feature. The fee schedule, while complex (6 scenarios), is transparently disclosed with all fees capped at $50 and a $6.50 flat rate for fully electronic delivery.

The form requests Last 4 SSN, which is more personal information than necessary. Section 9's acknowledgment section packs 11 bullet points of legal text in small font. The sensitive-information handling (Section 6) defaults to including psychiatric, substance use, and HIV information with an opt-out checkbox — permissible but puts the burden on the patient.

## Barriers and Strengths

**Barriers are minimal.** No notarization or witness is required. Submission is possible via fax (adequate electronic pathway) and mail, plus the Swellbox portal provides a fully digital alternative. The 30-day response timeline is stated explicitly, and the form commits to no treatment conditioning. Fees are disclosed upfront and capped.

**Notable strengths** include: the Spanish-language version linked alongside the English form; the differentiated Swellbox patient portal as a digital alternative; the transparent and capped fee schedule; the correctly scoped purpose question; and the inclusion of an electronic delivery option via a request portal. The QR code on the form header may provide an additional pathway, though its destination isn't determinable from the PDF.

**Red flags** are the dual-purpose authorization framing, the persistence of outdated forms on subdomains, and the image-only scan format — surprising for a 2023 form from a major academic medical center that fails basic WCAG/Section 508 accessibility standards.

## Overall Assessment

Vanderbilt Health provides a **competent but imperfect** patient records request experience. The organization earns credit for offering differentiated digital pathways (Swellbox patient portal), a Spanish translation, transparent fees, and a well-organized 2-page form. It falls short on digital-first form design (image-only scan, no fillable fields) and conflates patient access rights with third-party authorization. The availability of the Swellbox portal as an alternative substantially mitigates the PDF's technical limitations, making this an organization that serves digitally-savvy patients reasonably well while leaving paper-dependent patients with an unnecessarily cumbersome experience.

# Nemaha Valley Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital, an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Seneca, Kansas, provides two documents on its Resources page: an "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-2.pdf). The authorization form is the only mechanism available for patients to request their records. A Spanish-language version of the authorization form is also linked from the same page but was not separately downloaded for evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for disclosures to named third parties — a patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient and navigate fields (purpose, recipient address) that assume a third-party disclosure scenario. There is no mention of HIPAA § 164.524, no "right of access" language, and no separate pathway for individual access requests. The NPP, by contrast, does describe the right to inspect and obtain copies and even commits to providing records in electronic format upon request — but this information lives in a 12-page compliance document, not in the actual request form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) is accessible within two clicks from the homepage, and a site-scoped web search surfaced the link quickly. The page labels the form clearly as "Authorization for Release of Health Information." No bot blocking or access restrictions were encountered. General `filetype:pdf` searches did not return direct results, but this is a minor issue given how easily the form was found through site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a significant weakness. It is an **image-only scan** — a photocopy of a paper form scanned by a Savin copier in 2016, with zero extractable text, zero fillable fields, and no accessibility metadata. The revision date is January 2014, making it over a decade old. The form must be printed and filled out entirely by hand.

The layout is functional but dated, using a typewriter-style font with hand-drawn lines. Page 1 follows a logical sequence: patient identification, recipient designation, purpose, a 14-item record-type checklist, treatment date range, legal disclosures, and signature block. Page 2 is an internal cost-calculation worksheet that probably should not have been included in the patient-facing download — it shows per-page copy rates, labor charges, and staff-use fields for tracking releases. Both pages are erroneously labeled "Page 2 of 2."

The legal language is reasonably clear for a healthcare authorization form, but it is presented as dense paragraph text with no bold headings or visual breaks between disclosure sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable red flag is the **Social Security Number field**, which is prominently placed alongside name, birthdate, and MRN. SSN collection is unnecessary for medical records release and creates identity theft risk — especially concerning for a form that must be physically handled (printed, mailed, or hand-delivered).

The form provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address for the records department, no fax number, and no mention of email or portal submission. A patient would need to call the hospital to learn how to submit the completed form. The cost worksheet on page 2 references pick-up, mail, and fax as record delivery methods, suggesting fax capability exists, but no fax number is provided on the form itself.

Fees are very reasonable: $0.03 per page for copies, with a $3.90 per 15-minute labor charge. The per-page rate is well within HIPAA limits. The $10 charges for CDs and USB drives are dated but not egregious.

## Notable Strengths

Despite its weaknesses, the hospital has several bright spots. The availability of a **Spanish-language authorization form** is notable for a small rural hospital in Kansas. The **14-item record-type checklist** gives patients granular control over what is released. The **NPP is excellent** — recently updated (February 2026), it names a specific Privacy Officer with direct phone and email, commits to electronic format delivery, includes HIE participation transparency, and offers multilingual nondiscrimination taglines in 15+ languages. The contrast between the polished, current NPP and the decade-old scanned authorization form is striking.

## Overall Assessment

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital earns a **C grade**. The form is easy to find and fees are fair, but the core patient experience is undermined by an image-only scan that forces a fully paper-based workflow, a generic third-party authorization form with no patient access differentiation, an SSN field that creates unnecessary risk, and a complete absence of submission instructions. The hospital clearly has the capacity to produce quality digital documents (as evidenced by the NPP), but has not applied that capability to its records request process.

# Mankato Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mankato Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Mankato, Minnesota. Two PDF forms were found — both versions of the same "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" document (form MC032). Form-1 (revised 02/23) is the current version; form-2 (revised 07/20) is a superseded version that remains publicly accessible. The clinic also offers an online medical record request tool and accepts submissions via fax, email, and DocuSign, providing patients with multiple channels beyond the PDF form itself.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Mankato Clinic does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. Both forms use a generic two-party structure — "Release my medical records from" (source) and "Share my medical records with" (destination) — requiring a patient who wants their own records to awkwardly list Mankato Clinic as the source and themselves as the destination. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no indication that patients have a legal right to obtain their records. The form is framed entirely as a release/disclosure authorization.

That said, the clinic does offer an **online medical record request tool** at a separate URL, which may provide a more streamlined patient self-access experience. The ROI page also notes that DocuSign is accepted, and patients can submit signed authorizations by fax (507-388-1878) or email (ROI@mankatoclinic.com). This gives patients practical electronic submission options even though the PDF form itself is print-oriented.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced direct PDF links and the dedicated Release of Information page at `mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/`. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The ROI page provides clear contact information and links to both the PDF form and the online request tool. One minor concern: both the current and superseded form versions remain live with no redirect or deprecation notice, which could confuse patients.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — page 1 is the authorization, page 2 is a full page of field-by-field instructions. Despite being natively digital, the form has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, handwrite, and return via fax or mail. The policy that "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized" reinforces the print-and-sign workflow.

The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → source → destination → record types → reason → signature. Section headers use bolded questions ("WHO HAS INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE RELEASED?") with sidebar labels, creating a clear visual hierarchy. The form-1 revision improved readability by replacing clinical labels ("Health Care Facility / Provider") with plain language ("Release my medical records from"). The 11 record-type checkboxes cover a reasonable range including sensitive categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health/substance abuse). The instruction page is a genuine bright spot — section-by-section guidance that is uncommon and practically useful.

The form is English-only. Field count is moderate (approximately 20 fields including patient demographics, source/destination addresses, checkboxes, and signature). The legal boilerplate is clear and reasonably concise.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **Fees**: Vaguely disclosed — "I understand there may be a charge" with no amounts or schedule. Patients cannot anticipate costs before submitting.
- **Turnaround**: 7–10 business days stated, well within HIPAA's 30-day window.
- **Witness line**: The older form-2 includes a "Witnessed by" line (removed in form-1), which could have been perceived as a barrier.
- **Delivery options**: The form lists physical delivery methods only (given, mailed, faxed, pick up). The older form-2 instructions explicitly state "Medical records are not able to be emailed." No electronic delivery option appears on either form.
- **Authorization expiration**: 12 months with written revocation — standard and compliant.
- **Treatment conditioning**: Properly disclosed with HIPAA-compliant exceptions.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated instruction page** with practical guidance ("We prioritize requests by appointment date")
- **Multiple ROI contact points** — three offices with dedicated phone/fax, plus email
- **Accepts any HIPAA-compliant form**, including the Minnesota Standard Consent Form
- **Online request tool** available as an alternative to the PDF form
- **Modernized plain-language labels** in the current form version

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable fields on a natively digital PDF — an unnecessary friction point
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release
- Vague fee disclosure with no specific amounts
- No mention of patient rights or HIPAA Right of Access
- Two versions of the same form hosted simultaneously without deprecation notice

## Overall Assessment

Mankato Clinic makes its ROI form easy to find and provides multiple submission channels (fax, email, online tool), which removes the most critical access barriers. The form itself is well-organized with an unusually helpful instruction page. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization framing (no patient access pathway differentiation), and vague fee disclosure keep it from excelling. The organization's practical accommodations — multiple contact points, alternative submission methods, acceptance of any HIPAA-compliant form — partially compensate for the form's design limitations.

# Huntington Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Huntington Hospital, a community hospital in Huntington, NY, is part of the Northwell Health system and uses Northwell's system-wide forms for all records requests. Four documents were retrieved: a general third-party Authorization for Release of Health Information (form-1) with companion instructions (form-2), and a dedicated patient-specific Request for Access form (form-3) with its own companion instructions (form-4). The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-3**, the "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative."

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Access Form

Northwell Health distinguishes itself by maintaining **two separate form types**: one for third-party release (form-1) and one specifically for patient self-access (form-3). This two-form architecture is uncommon among healthcare organizations and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to HIPAA compliance. Form-3 opens with an explicit citation of HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524, informing patients of their right of access, and presents "To me" as the first recipient option — signaling that patient self-access is the primary use case, not an afterthought.

However, there is a notable gap: form-1 (the third-party release form) contains **no cross-reference** to form-3. A patient who encounters the general authorization first would have no indication that a separate, more appropriate form exists for their self-access request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. All four documents are directly linked from the Northwell Health medical records page at northwell.edu. The main friction point was search disambiguation — "Huntington Hospital" also refers to a facility in California, requiring "Northwell" to be added to queries. No facility-specific forms exist at huntington.northwell.edu; patients must navigate to the parent system site. URLs are descriptive (e.g., `request-for-access-to-health-information-form-english-2022.pdf`), and the filename's "english" suffix hints at a multilingual intent, though no non-English versions were found during retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a strong document. At **2 pages with 28 fillable fields**, it is a genuinely interactive PDF that patients can complete digitally without printing. The layout follows a logical numbered structure: patient demographics, source facility, recipient, delivery method/format matrix, record type selection, substance use/HIV consent section, and signature block. The delivery options are notably comprehensive — mail, facility pickup, secure email, unsecure email (with explicit risk acknowledgment), fax, USB flash drive, and CD.

The language is generally accessible, using informal parenthetical labels like "(From Who)" that prioritize clarity over grammatical precision. The companion instruction document (form-4) provides step-by-step guidance with concrete examples ("Jane Patient," "Dr. Jane Jones at 300 Northwell Drive"), which is a genuine accessibility aid.

The form does have minor weaknesses: the delivery method matrix with nested checkboxes requires careful reading, and the witness signature line is ambiguous — it doesn't state whether a witness is required or optional, which could create a perceived barrier.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and does not mandate in-person submission. The expiration field applies only to substance use disorder and HIV records (consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 and NY law), not to the general access request — a correct implementation. No fees are disclosed, which avoids discouragement but leaves patients without cost visibility.

The most significant gap is the **absence of submission instructions**. Neither form-3 nor its instructions (form-4) specify where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link is provided. A patient could fill out the form perfectly and still not know what to do with it. This is a systemic gap across all four Northwell documents.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation — rare among healthcare organizations
- **28 fillable fields** enabling fully digital completion
- **Companion instruction documents** with annotated visual examples — genuinely helpful and uncommon
- **Comprehensive delivery format options** including USB flash drive and secure/unsecure email with informed consent

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No submission instructions** on any form or instruction document
- **No cross-reference** between the third-party form (form-1) and patient access form (form-3)
- **Witness line ambiguity** may deter patients who assume a witness is mandatory
- **Third-party form (form-1) lacks fillable fields** despite patient access form having 28 — inconsistent modernization

## Overall Assessment

Huntington Hospital, through its parent system Northwell Health, provides an above-average patient access experience. The dedicated patient access form with HIPAA citation, fillable fields, comprehensive delivery options, and companion instructions represent genuine investment in patient-centered design. The primary gaps — missing submission instructions and lack of cross-referencing between forms — are meaningful but do not fundamentally obstruct access. This organization earns a **B grade**, reflecting strong patient-centeredness and good document quality with room for improvement in workflow completeness.
