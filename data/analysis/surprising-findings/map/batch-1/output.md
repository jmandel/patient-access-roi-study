# Surprising Findings — Batch 1

## Form Quality Is Regressing at Some Organizations

Several organizations have published newer forms that are demonstrably worse than their predecessors. **University of Iowa Hospitals** replaced a form with 50 fillable fields with a 2024 version that has zero — and simultaneously removed the "Myself at the address above" recipient shortcut that made patient self-access intuitive. **NorthLakes Community Clinic** (FQHC, WI) regressed from a 54-field fillable form to a non-fillable flat PDF in December 2023, with both versions still live under the same form number and no guidance on which to use. Most strikingly, **Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital** (Bon Secours Mercy Health, OH) replaced a text-based PDF with searchable content with an image-only scan — completely inaccessible to screen readers. These aren't legacy neglect; they are active regressions introduced during form updates.

## Provider-Facing Forms Get More Investment Than Patient-Facing Ones

**Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers** (for-profit practice, AZ) reveals a telling asymmetry: its form for *other providers* to send records *to* Ironwood has 22 fillable fields and was updated in 2023, while its patient-facing release form has zero fillable fields, dates to 2019, and is effectively orphaned — not linked from any active webpage. The organization invested in making it easy for providers to send records in while neglecting the patient's ability to get records out.

## A For-Profit CHS Hospital Leads the Batch

**Flowers Hospital** (Community Health Systems, Dothan, AL) earned the batch's only A grade (4.65/5). This for-profit community hospital offers a dedicated "Patient Request for Health Information" form with "Myself" as the first recipient option, 66 fillable fields, a co-equal Spanish translation with identical interactivity, and a Swellbox online portal. It outperforms every teaching hospital and major academic medical center in this batch — including Mass General (3.75), UCSF (3.65), Northwestern (not scored in structured data but strong), and UPMC Presbyterian (2.9). The assumption that large nonprofit academic centers produce better patient-facing materials is flatly contradicted here.

## Physician Gatekeeping Undermines Patient Access Rights

**Mercy General Hospital** (Dignity Health/CommonSpirit, Sacramento, CA) requires *physician approval* before patients can access their own HIV test results and *caregiver approval* for psychiatric records. A physician notification-and-veto mechanism is built into the standard patient access workflow. This likely violates HIPAA's Right of Access, which permits denial only through a formal review process with appeal rights — neither of which is disclosed on the form.

## Small Rural Hospitals Sometimes Outperform Major Systems

**Fallon Medical Complex** (25-bed CAH, Baker, MT) offers seven delivery format options — paper, USB, CD, fax, in-person review, unencrypted email with informed consent, and patient portal — plus a first-copy-free policy. **GHC of South Central Wisconsin** (independent nonprofit practice, Madison) scores 4.4 with a dedicated fillable patient access form, 49 interactive fields, encrypted email delivery, and a 5-day turnaround commitment. Meanwhile, **UPMC Presbyterian** (900 beds, Pittsburgh) scores 2.9 with no fillable fields, no online portal, and ambiguous fee language that may condition access on prepayment. Resource constraints don't necessarily predict patient experience quality.

## Name Confusion Creates Wrong-Organization Hazards

Web searches for several organizations returned forms belonging to entirely different entities with similar names. **Hillcrest Hospital Claremore** (Ardent Health, OK) yielded a form from Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego. **UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital** retrieved a form from UC Health Cincinnati. **Mercy Health Springfield** (Bon Secours, OH) pulled up a form from Mercy (mercy.net — a completely separate Missouri system). Patients performing the same searches could easily download and submit the wrong organization's form.

## Exposed Internal Artifacts Reach Patients

Two **Tenet Healthcare** facilities — **Good Samaritan Medical Center** (FL) and **Piedmont Medical Center** (SC) — have downloadable PDFs containing visible mail-merge placeholders like `«PatientNumber»` and `«PatientName»`. These unprocessed template fields appear in the documents patients are expected to use, eroding trust and suggesting minimal quality review. Piedmont's forms also date to 2013 and pre-2010 respectively.

## Emerging Interoperability Options Appear on Forms

**Emory University Hospital** and **Bayshore Medical Center** (Hackensack Meridian Health) both offer "EHI Export" as a named delivery option — machine-readable records uploadable to another EHR system. **Riverside Community Hospital** and **Medical City Dallas** (both HCA) include USCDI release request options. These forward-looking interoperability features are extremely rare on ROI forms and signal awareness of health data exchange standards, though the technical jargon ("Requires Direct Address or National Provider Identifier") would be meaningless to most patients.

## Olmsted Medical Center's Somali-Language Form

**Olmsted Medical Center** (independent nonprofit practice, Rochester, MN) offers its ROI form in English, Spanish, and Somali — directly responsive to Rochester's significant Somali refugee community. This is the only organization in the batch offering a form in a language beyond English and Spanish, and it comes not from a major health system but from an independent 61-bed community practice.

## The Baton Rouge Clinic's Self-Defeating Right of Access Form

**The Baton Rouge Clinic** (independent for-profit practice, LA) shows unusual regulatory sophistication with a three-form strategy differentiating outbound release, inbound transfer, and Right of Access — explicitly citing HIPAA § 164.524. But the Right of Access form is framed entirely as a designee authorization ("disclose records to: Name: ___"), with no clear option for a patient to request records for themselves. The form most directly invoking patient access rights can't actually be used for the most common patient access scenario.
