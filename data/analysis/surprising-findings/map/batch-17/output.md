# Surprising Findings — Batch 17

## The For-Profit Paradox: Community Health Systems Leads the Pack

The single A-grade organization across all 190 scored in this batch is **Flowers Hospital** (Dothan, AL) — a *for-profit* hospital owned by Community Health Systems (CHS). Its "Patient Request for Health Information" form lists "Myself" as the first recipient option, offers 66 fillable fields on one page, provides co-equal Spanish translation, and adds a Swellbox portal alternative. Its sibling **Merit Health Central** (Jackson, MS) also scores 4.15. CHS is a for-profit chain not typically associated with patient-centered design, yet its standardized form outperforms every nonprofit academic medical center in the sample. Meanwhile, for-profit hospitals as a group score only slightly below nonprofits (3.28 vs. 3.35 mean), defying the intuition that profit motive degrades patient access.

## FQHCs: The Most Surprising Underperformers

FQHCs — federally funded to serve underserved communities — have the *lowest* mean score of any facility type (2.96), below even critical access hospitals (3.10). Five FQHCs offer no online records pathway whatsoever: **Aaron E. Henry CHC** (Clarksdale, MS), **Franklin Primary Health Center** (Mobile, AL), **Peoples Health Centers** (St. Louis, MO), **El Rio Health** (Tucson, AZ), and **La Clínica de la Raza** (Oakland, CA) all scored D or F. These organizations serve populations with the greatest need for accessible records — immigration, disability claims, care transitions — yet provide the least accessible pathways. The contrast with top-performing FQHCs like **CrescentCare** (New Orleans, 4.15) and **Philadelphia FIGHT** (Philadelphia, 4.0), which maintain dedicated patient access forms and bilingual materials, shows this is a design choice, not a resource constraint.

## East Georgia's Inverted Form: Digital Infrastructure Applied Backwards

**East Georgia Healthcare Center** invested in RightSignature e-signatures, bilingual forms, and a navigable forms page — then applied all of it to the *wrong form*. Their ROI form is exclusively for incoming records, with EGHC's own address hardcoded as the destination. A patient trying to get records *from* EGHC finds no applicable form. This is a uniquely instructive failure: the infrastructure exists but the use case was never considered.

## The SSN Epidemic: Nearly One in Four Organizations

47 of 190 organizations (25%) request Social Security Numbers on records request forms — a document routinely transmitted by fax or mail. This cuts across all facility types: from **Barnes-Jewish Hospital** (requesting full SSN) to tiny **Nemaha Valley Community Hospital**. Several mark the field as mandatory. HIPAA requires no such identifier; name, DOB, and medical record number suffice. This represents a systemic privacy risk that appears rooted in form templates rather than institutional policy.

## Linguistic Reach Beyond Spanish: Hmong, Somali, and Haitian Creole

While 63 organizations offer Spanish translations, a handful go further in ways that precisely match local demographics. **Prevea Health** (Green Bay, WI) publishes forms in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — reflecting Wisconsin's refugee communities. **Olmsted Medical Center** (Rochester, MN) offers Somali, serving the large Somali population near the Mayo Clinic. **Good Samaritan Medical Center** (West Palm Beach, FL) and **Memorial Healthcare System** (Hollywood, FL) provide Haitian Creole, appropriate for South Florida. **NewYork-Presbyterian** offers Chinese. This demographic responsiveness is rare and noteworthy.

## Wayne County Hospital: A 25-Bed Rural Overachiever

**Wayne County Hospital** (Monticello, KY), a 25-bed critical access hospital, offers both a downloadable PDF and a web-based HTML submission form — a dual-pathway approach that most 500+ bed teaching hospitals lack. It prints Kentucky's free-first-copy statute (KRS 422.317) directly on the form. Email delivery is offered. For context, **UPMC Presbyterian** — a flagship academic hospital in a major health system — scores lower (2.9 vs. 3.65) and offers zero fillable fields on its form despite being digitally authored.

## Text-Message Records Requests: A Channel of One

**Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center** appears to be the only organization in the sample offering a text-message channel for initiating ROI requests ("TEXT ME to 907-743-7200"). In 2026, when every other industry has embraced SMS, the healthcare records request process remains almost entirely paper-and-fax.

## Teaching Hospital Stumbles

Three teaching hospitals score below 3.0: **UPMC Presbyterian** (2.9), **UMMC** (2.85), and **Cone Health** (2.9). UMMC's case is particularly striking — its English-language form link returns a 404 error, and the only copy available was found on a third-party caching site. The Spanish version was the only one still live at its canonical URL. A patient at Mississippi's flagship academic medical center today cannot download a records request form from the hospital's own website.
