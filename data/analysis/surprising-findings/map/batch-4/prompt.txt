# Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center: Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system, offers patients three distinct pathways to request medical records: **MyChart** (patient portal), **eRequest** (an online wizard powered by Swellbox/Datavant at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html), and a **downloadable paper form**. Fax (513-599-4503), email (MercyROI@datavant.com), and phone (844-835-1238) are also listed as contact channels for Springfield.

Four PDF documents were retrieved, but only two are relevant to Springfield patients. **Form-1** is from mercy.net (a separate Missouri-based Mercy system)—a false positive caused by the confusingly similar branding. **Form-2** is a Youngstown-region variant from the correct system but wrong region. **Form-3** is the system-wide authorization form currently linked on the website, but it is an **image-only scan** with only 46 characters of extractable text—functionally inaccessible to screen readers or digital filling. **Form-4** (MHP 0785 Rev 1/19) is the Springfield-specific authorization form with full text layer, but it is **not linked anywhere on the website**—it was discovered only by guessing the URL pattern (`mercy.com/-/media/.../springfield.ashx`).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. All PDF forms are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information"—generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release. Form-4 accommodates patient self-access via a "Self" checkbox and defaults the purpose to "For Personal use if not otherwise stated," which is patient-friendly. However, the form structure, title, and legal framing are oriented toward third-party authorization. A dedicated patient access request form (like the one from the Missouri mercy.net system, ironically) does not exist within Bon Secours Mercy Health's offerings for Springfield.

The eRequest portal via Swellbox/Datavant represents a potentially more patient-centric pathway, as it is an online records request wizard that may differentiate between request types. However, only the PDF forms were directly evaluated.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page was straightforward—`mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests` is well-organized with clear pathways. However, finding the **right PDF form** for Springfield was surprisingly difficult. The linked system-wide form (form-3) is an image-only scan—a 2024 regression from the 2019 text-based regional versions. The Springfield-specific text version exists at a predictable URL but is entirely undiscoverable through normal website navigation. Additionally, web searches conflated mercy.com (Ohio) with mercy.net (Missouri), producing a false-positive form from the wrong health system.

## Form Document Quality (Form-4, the Best Available PDF)

Form-4 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a full text layer—but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it requires printing and hand-filling. The layout is logical: patient demographics → facility selection → date range → record types (11 checkboxes) → recipient → format → delivery → legal disclosures → signature. The top half is clear and well-organized; the bottom half compresses six dense legal bullet points into small paragraphs with complex language ("Treatment, Operations or Payment disclosures to insurance companies when the law gives the right to the insurers to contest a claim under policy"). The form cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and offers four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email) with electronic format (PDF/CD) as the default—an uncommon patient-friendly choice.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable concerns emerge. First, **"Photo ID required at the time of request"** is stated in the header with no guidance on how this applies to fax or mail submissions, creating ambiguity that could deter remote requests. Second, **"Entire record (standard two years of information, unless otherwise specified)"** imposes a default time limitation that patients may not notice, potentially resulting in incomplete records when HIPAA's Right of Access covers the entire designated record set. Fee language is vague: "There may be a charge for copies of records" with no amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee distinction. No notarization is required, and multiple electronic submission methods are available (fax, email).

## Notable Strengths

The organization offers a genuinely multi-channel approach: MyChart, Swellbox/Datavant eRequest portal, and paper form with fax/email/mail submission. The electronic format default, personal-use default purpose, explicit § 164.524 reference, and MyChart delivery option are all bright spots. The form is available in English only—no multilingual versions were found for Springfield.

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center provides an **adequate but fragmented** patient records request experience. The eRequest portal and MyChart offer digital pathways, but the downloadable form—the fallback option—suffers from critical problems: the linked version is an image-only scan, the better text version is hidden, no forms have fillable fields, and the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access instrument. The result is a C-grade experience where digitally-savvy patients who find the portal do fine, but patients seeking a traditional form encounter unnecessary friction.

# Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital (Richmond, VA) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital is part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system and uses system-wide forms for its Richmond-area facilities. Two PDF forms were found: an English-language "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" (form-1.pdf, BSR-MR-50, rev. 1/21) and a Spanish-language equivalent (form-2.pdf, BSR-MR-50SPN, rev. 11/17). Both are single-page, non-fillable PDFs linked directly from the system's medical records page. Beyond the PDF forms, Bon Secours also offers an online request pathway via Ciox/Swellbox and MyChart patient portal access, giving patients three distinct channels to request records.

## Access Pathway: Individual Access vs. Third-Party Release

The PDF form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed for third-party disclosure — the structure asks the patient to authorize a facility "TO DISCLOSE" information to a named recipient. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly name themselves as both authorizer and recipient, navigating a form whose conceptual framework doesn't match their use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form.

That said, the form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an "eDelivery by Ciox (for patient's only)" delivery option specifically marked as patient-exclusive. These suggest some awareness of the patient self-access use case, but the form itself was not redesigned around it. The availability of Ciox/Swellbox as an online portal likely represents a more patient-centered pathway, though it was not evaluated in detail as it is a web-based tool rather than a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately surfaced the Bon Secours medical records page at `bonsecours.com/patient-resources/request-medical-records`, where both PDF forms are directly linked alongside information about online and MyChart options. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The URL path (`roi-form-2017.ashx`) is somewhat opaque but the page itself is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English form (form-1.pdf) is a digitally-authored, single-page PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. The layout is compact and logically ordered: demographics → record types → recipient → delivery format → purpose → legal terms → signature. The top half uses clear, short labels; the bottom half shifts to dense legal language across four numbered paragraphs. Twelve record-type checkboxes plus two "Other" fields provide good scope granularity. Five delivery format options (US Mail, CD/DVD, Radiology Film/CD, MyChart, Ciox eDelivery) are notably generous.

The Spanish version mirrors the English form but lags by over three years (November 2017 vs. January 2021), contains several untranslated English field labels ("Anesthesia Record," "Radiology Film/CD"), and has a minor typographical error (double closing parenthesis). While the existence of a Spanish form is commendable, the version discrepancy raises concerns about whether Spanish-speaking patients receive equivalent information.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees are vaguely stated**: "copying charges will be applied, according to the hospital policy" — with no specific amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) and third-party release fees. This is a compliance concern.
- **No response time stated** on the form.
- **Fax submission is available** (fax number listed in notes: 804-673-9561), so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multilingual availability**: English and Spanish forms linked from the same page — better than most organizations.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Five options including MyChart and Ciox eDelivery with email, going well beyond the typical mail-or-fax binary.
- **Multiple request channels**: PDF form, Ciox/Swellbox online portal, and MyChart portal give patients real choice.
- **Single-page efficiency**: All necessary content on one page reduces patient burden.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference**: The form cites the HIPAA Right of Access provision, which is uncommon and helpful.

## Weaknesses

- **Generic disclosure form, not patient-access form**: The form is conceptually designed for third-party release, forcing patients to adapt.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form lacks any interactive fields — a missed opportunity.
- **Vague fee language**: No fee schedule, no patient-access fee distinction.
- **Spanish version outdated**: Three-year lag behind English version with untranslated fields.

## Overall Assessment

Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The form is easy to find, compact, and offers unusually good delivery options including electronic delivery for patients. The multilingual availability and multiple request channels (PDF, Swellbox, MyChart) are genuine strengths. However, the core PDF form remains a generic third-party authorization that doesn't center the patient self-access use case, it lacks fillable fields, and its fee language falls short of HIPAA transparency standards. The overall experience is adequate but not exemplary — a patient can get their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary user.

# West Tennessee Healthcare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

West Tennessee Healthcare (Jackson, TN) is a government-owned regional health system that demonstrates an above-average approach to patient record access by maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** (form-3) separate from its third-party release authorization (form-2) and an older clinic-level release form (form-1). The organization also offers an online request portal via ScanSTAT and publishes Spanish-language versions of its key forms. However, the forms themselves are not fillable PDFs, and some legacy legal language undermines the patient-centered intent.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all linked from a clearly labeled medical records page at wth.org/request-medical-records/:

- **Form-3 (primary)**: "Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — explicitly subtitled "To be used when patient wants to access their own medical record or allow a personal representative to do so." This is the most relevant form for patient self-access. It offers five delivery methods: paper, fax, CD/DVD, portal, and email (encrypted or unencrypted). Two pages, ~3,300 characters.
- **Form-2**: "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" — a third-party release authorization. One page, similar structure but without the portal delivery option.
- **Form-1**: "Medical Release Authorization" — an older (2019) form specific to the West Tennessee Medical Group Clinics. Functions as a general release for discussing care with designated individuals.

Additionally, the medical records page links to a **ScanSTAT online request portal** for hospital records, providing a fully digital alternative pathway. Spanish versions of forms 2 and 3 are also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

West Tennessee Healthcare clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release — a practice that relatively few organizations follow. Form-3 uses "request" language (appropriate for HIPAA § 164.524) rather than "authorization" language, and includes a portal delivery shortcut ("If choosing portal, please proceed to signature line. No other action needed"). The medical records webpage provides context to help patients choose the correct form. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The layout is logical — flowing from identification to delivery method to record selection to legal terms to signature — but relies on underscored blank lines and an initials-based record type selection system (15 categories). The language is moderately accessible in the patient-facing sections but becomes denser in the five legal "I understand" statements. No section headers divide the form; the structure relies on spatial layout and field labels. At two pages, the length is proportionate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search returned direct PDF links, and the medical records page is clearly labeled and well-organized. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The page provides good context about when to use each form.

## Barriers and Concerns

Two compliance issues stand out on form-3:

1. **Liability waiver**: "The facility is hereby released from any liability and the undersigned will hold the facility harmless for complying with this request." Requiring patients to waive liability to exercise their Right of Access is problematic under HIPAA.
2. **90-day expiration on an access request**: This language was carried over from the authorization form and is conceptually inappropriate — a patient access request is a one-time action, not an ongoing authorization that needs to expire.

Additional minor concerns include the driver's license requirement for non-in-person requests, SSN collection (last 4 digits), no fee disclosure, and no explicit statement of patient rights or response timeframe. The form also omits the non-conditioning statement that appears on form-2.

## Bright Spots

- **Dedicated patient access form** with clear purpose statement
- **ScanSTAT online portal** as an alternative digital pathway
- **Spanish-language versions** of both key forms
- **Multiple delivery options** including portal and encrypted email with risk disclosure
- **Easy findability** from a well-organized medical records page

## Overall Assessment

West Tennessee Healthcare shows genuine patient-centered intent by distinguishing patient access from third-party release and offering multiple pathways including an online portal. The organization loses points for non-fillable PDFs, legacy legal language (liability waiver, expiration clause), and missing rights/fee information. The structural approach is strong, but the execution — particularly the form document quality and some compliance details — keeps this from being a top-tier example. Overall, a solid B-level performance that could reach A-level with fillable fields and cleaned-up legal language.

# Esse Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Esse Health is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in St. Louis, Missouri. Two documents were retrieved from their patient forms page: an Authorization for Release of Medical Information (form-1.pdf) and a communication/message authorization (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own health records. Notably, Esse Health also offers a DocuSign-based electronic submission pathway for the same ROI form, which meaningfully improves the overall patient experience.

## Access Pathway

Esse Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single ROI form (form-1.pdf) is a generic HIPAA authorization with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED BY" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields — a structure designed for records transfers between providers or releases to attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no separate section for individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient requesting their own records has different rights than a third party requesting records on someone's behalf.

The form does cite 45 CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA right of access provision), which is a positive signal, but this is buried in a dense paragraph of legal language rather than presented as guidance for patients. The availability of a DocuSign electronic submission option is a genuine bright spot — it allows patients to complete and submit the form digitally without printing, scanning, or visiting the office.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF URL, and the patient forms page at `essehealth.com/patient-center/patient-forms/` is well-organized with clear labeling under "General Forms." No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The retrieval was rated **easy**. One minor issue: the communication authorization form (form-2) has "Medical Records" in its website title, which could mislead a patient looking for the actual records release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF. While the metadata reports 28 fillable field annotations, the field names array is empty, suggesting the fields may not be properly configured for interactive use. The form relies on underline blanks — it was designed primarily as a print-and-write document. However, the DocuSign alternative compensates significantly by providing a fully interactive digital pathway.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, release from/to fields, 11 record-type checkboxes, sensitive information disclosure, revocation and expiration language, and signature. The language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese — the opening authorization statement is clear, but the disclosure paragraphs covering HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse are denser. At one page, the form is appropriately concise without being cramped.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment. It provides a six-month default expiration and a revocation mechanism, though the revocation language ("present my written cancellation to the health information management department") is ambiguous about whether this can be done remotely. Fee disclosure is vague — "there may be a charge associated with copying my health information" — with no specifics about amounts or HIPAA's cost-based limits. No delivery format options (electronic, paper, mail, pick-up) are mentioned, which is a gap for patient self-access scenarios. Submission options include the DocuSign electronic pathway, making electronic submission available.

## Overall Assessment

Esse Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The key strength is the DocuSign electronic submission option, which elevates the experience above many peers by enabling end-to-end digital completion and submission. The key weakness is the lack of any differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — the generic authorization form forces patients to navigate a process not designed for them. The form itself is clean and concise but not interactive, and the fee disclosure is vague. For an independent physician practice, this represents a middle-of-the-road effort: the form is easy to find and usable, but the organization has not invested in a patient-centered access pathway.

# Abbeville Area Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Abbeville Area Medical Center (AAMC) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Abbeville, South Carolina. Two documents were found on its website: an authorization form for releasing protected health information (form-1.pdf) and a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices brochure (form-2.pdf). Only the authorization form is relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Patient Self-Access Distinction

AAMC provides a single, generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (HIM 1022) for all record requests. The form is clearly designed for third-party release — it asks the patient to identify a "Name/Facility" recipient and authorize disclosure "to the following individual or group." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as both the patient and the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access form, no separate pathway or section for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524, and no mention of the right to access one's own records anywhere on the authorization form.

The companion HIPAA brochure (form-2.pdf) does articulate patient rights well, including the right to electronic copies and a 30-day response timeline, but this informational document is entirely disconnected from the authorization workflow. A patient would need to read two separate documents and synthesize the information themselves.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible within 2–3 clicks from the homepage via Patients & Visitors navigation. The PDF is directly linked and downloads without login, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking. The WordPress site is simple and functional. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The authorization form is a single page — admirably brief compared to multi-page forms at other organizations. It follows a logical numbered structure: authorization/recipient identification, record type selection (16 specific checkboxes), dates of service, purpose, and signature block. However, the form has significant technical limitations:

- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive form fields. All checkboxes are static Unicode characters, and all blanks are underscored lines. A patient must print the PDF and fill it in by hand.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no address, fax number, email, or department contact. A patient downloading this from the website would have no idea where to send the completed form. The fax number and mailing address must be found separately (the NPP brochure provides the Privacy Officer's P.O. Box and phone number).
- **No "All Records" option**: The 16 granular checkboxes are useful for targeted requests but there is no "Complete Medical Record" option for patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Ambiguous fields**: Item 2 ("Date records were printed and/or CD was requested") appears to be an internal staff field but is numbered as if patients should complete it.

The language is a mix of plain English at the top and denser legal boilerplate at the bottom. Required fields are marked with asterisks, but the legend ("* Must Have Information") appears only at the very bottom of the page.

## Barriers

- **Witness requirement**: The form requires two witness signatures (marked with asterisks as required), which goes beyond HIPAA requirements for patient self-access and creates a logistical barrier.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: The form automatically includes authorization to release psychiatric, substance abuse, HIV, and STD records with no opt-out mechanism. Patients who want general medical records but wish to exclude sensitive categories cannot do so.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires 90 days from signing, which could force resubmission if processing is delayed.
- **No fee information**: The form discloses nothing about costs. The NPP brochure vaguely mentions "there will be a charge" without amounts.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: Everything fits on one page, reducing patient burden.
- **Fax acceptance**: The form explicitly states "A faxed copy of this release shall be deemed as having the same effect as the original," enabling remote submission.
- **Granular record-type selection**: The 16 checkboxes give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **NPP quality**: The privacy brochure includes clear language about the right to electronic copies and a 30-day timeline — strong for a small critical access hospital.

## Overall Assessment

AAMC provides a minimally adequate but dated approach to patient record requests. The form is easy to find and mercifully short, but it offers no digital-first workflow, no patient-access-specific pathway, and no submission instructions. A patient must print the form, handwrite their information, find a fax number or mailing address from a separate document, and obtain two witness signatures — all to exercise a fundamental HIPAA right. The organization earns credit for accessibility of retrieval and brevity of form, but loses ground on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and unnecessary barriers. Grade: **C**.

# Good Samaritan Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Good Samaritan Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in West Palm Beach, FL, operated under the Palm Beach Health Network (PBHN), itself part of Tenet Healthcare. The facility offers two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records release — an older facility-specific version (form-1, dated 2014) and a newer network-wide version (form-2, dated 2020). Records requests are processed through Datavant, a third-party ROI vendor, with email submission available. The parent system's medical records page also offers the form in Spanish and Haitian Creole.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

Good Samaritan does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — standard third-party disclosure authorization forms. A patient requesting their own records must name themselves as the "RECIPIENT" (the field asks for "person(s) to whom [the facility] may disclose my health information") and check "Personal Use" under the PURPOSE section. This is functional but unintuitive; the form was clearly designed for disclosures to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties, not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. Neither form references the right of access, offers format options for records delivery, or distinguishes self-access from third-party release in any meaningful way.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search immediately surfaced a direct link to form-1 on the hospital's website, and the parent PBHN medical records page linked to form-2 along with Spanish and Haitian Creole versions. However, Cloudflare bot protection blocked programmatic download, requiring browser-based workarounds. For a typical patient using a browser, this would not be an issue. One source of confusion: both the older facility form and the newer network form are published simultaneously with no guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2, the 2020 network version) is a 2-page print-and-fill PDF with **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring handwriting. The form follows a logical structure — facility selection, demographics, record type checkboxes (20 categories), recipient, term, purpose, super-confidential categories — but is visually dense with small fonts. Notably, form-2 exposes raw mail-merge placeholders in the sidebar (`«PatientNumber»`, `«PatientName»`, `«BirthDate»`, etc.) that are meaningless to patients and appear unprofessional. The form also references a Privacy Office address "listed below" that does not actually appear anywhere on the document — a broken internal reference that prevents patients from exercising their right to revoke authorization.

The language is moderately legalistic. The legal paragraphs on redisclosure, revocation, and treatment conditioning are standard healthcare boilerplate but lack plain-language explanation. The form collects Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for HIPAA identity verification and creates data security risk on a form transmitted via fax or mail.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit via fax (561-650-6467, listed on form-1), email to Datavant (SM-Tenetgoodsamaritan@Datavant.com, per retrieval notes), mail, or in-person pickup. The availability of fax and email means patients are not forced to physically visit the facility, which meets the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**Barriers:** SSN collection is unnecessary and potentially deterrent. No fees are disclosed — patients have no visibility into costs before submitting. The form's lack of fillable fields means the entire completion process is paper-based. Form-2 is missing Privacy Office contact information, and its omission of the remuneration disclosure present in form-1 raises compliance questions given Datavant's involvement.

**Bright spots:** Multilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is a genuine strength for the Palm Beach community. The 20+ record-type checkboxes give patients granular control over what is disclosed. Flexible authorization term options (specific date, until fulfilled, until event, until withdrawn) are well-designed. The super-confidential information section on page 2 properly handles Florida state law and 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for sensitive health information categories.

## Overall Assessment

Good Samaritan Medical Center provides a functional but patient-unfriendly records request process. The organization funnels all requestors — patients and third parties alike — through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access. The forms lack digital fillability, contain confusing internal system artifacts, and collect unnecessary personal information. While multilingual availability and granular record selection are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects a process designed around institutional workflow rather than patient needs. Grade: **C**.

# GI Alliance — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

GI Alliance is a large, for-profit physician practice management organization headquartered in Southlake, TX, operating dozens of affiliated gastroenterology practices nationwide. Three forms were retrieved: one text-based authorization form from the main gialliance.com website (form-1), and two image-only scanned forms from affiliate practices Granite Peaks GI (form-2) and University GI (form-3). Form-1 is the canonical, centrally published document and represents the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway: No Dedicated Patient Route

GI Alliance does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. Form-1 is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information," while forms 2 and 3 are explicitly titled "Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party." None reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or acknowledge the distinct legal framework for patient self-access versus third-party authorization (§ 164.508).

Form-1 does include a "at Patient's request" checkbox under the purpose section, making it technically usable for patient-directed requests, but the form structure — requiring a recipient address, lacking delivery format preferences, and using authorization language throughout — treats the patient as just another requester rather than an individual exercising a legal right. This conflation could cause the organization to inadvertently apply third-party authorization rules (higher fees, broader denial grounds) to patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the primary form was relatively straightforward. A site-specific web search surfaced form-1 directly at a WordPress uploads URL. GI Alliance maintains a patient forms page at `gialliance.com/patient-forms-and-prep/`, but it is organized by local brand/location, adding navigational complexity for patients who must first identify their affiliate practice. The affiliate forms (forms 2 and 3) required searching beyond the main domain. No login wall, bot blocking, or portal gating was encountered. Retrieval difficulty: easy for the main form, moderate for the affiliate variants.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available document, is a single-page text-based PDF authored digitally in Microsoft Word — a significant quality advantage over the affiliate scans. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are rendered as underscores, requiring the patient to print and handwrite. There is no electronic signature capability and no submit button. The form must be printed, completed by hand, and returned — but critically, **no submission method is specified anywhere on the form** (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link). A patient who downloads this form has no way to know where to send it without calling the organization.

The layout is logical, following standard authorization flow: patient identification → recipient → scope → sensitive categories → purpose → duration/revocation → signature. However, there are no bold section headers, no instructional text, and the language is moderately legalistic (e.g., "d/b/a GI Alliance on behalf of itself and all other practices that are operating as a single HIPAA Affiliated Covered Entity"). The form is concise at one page, which is a positive.

The affiliate forms (2 and 3) are substantially worse in quality: form-2 is a browser print-to-PDF with a completely garbled text layer (broken Type 3 font encoding), and form-3 is a raw scan with no text layer at all. Both are inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally. Form-3 appears to be truncated, missing required HIPAA authorization elements like the signature block and revocation instructions.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blank provider identity**: Form-1 leaves both the authorizing entity name and the revocation mailing address as blank fill-ins, creating a functional barrier for patients who don't know which affiliate practice to name.
- **No submission instructions**: None of the three forms specify where to submit the completed authorization.
- **No fee disclosure**: No mention of fees or the patient's right to cost-based pricing under HIPAA.
- **No processing timeline**: No indication of how long records fulfillment will take.
- **SSN collection**: Forms 2 and 3 request the last four digits of SSN — unnecessary for HIPAA record requests and a potential deterrent.
- **No delivery format options**: Form-1 does not ask how the patient wants to receive records; forms 2 and 3 offer only "E-Delivery" and "Mail."

## Bright Spots

- **Sensitive information categories**: Form-1 requires separate initials for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance use, and genetic information — a compliance-conscious design respecting state-level protections.
- **Explicit non-conditioning statement**: The clear declaration that treatment/payment won't be conditioned on signing is present and well-stated.
- **Concise format**: Form-1 covers all essential elements on a single page without being excessively dense.
- **Granular record selection** (affiliate forms): Forms 2 and 3 offer 9-10 specific record-type checkboxes, giving patients meaningful control over what information is released.

## Overall Assessment

GI Alliance provides a minimally adequate but patient-unfriendly records request experience. The organization channels all access requests — whether from patients, insurers, or attorneys — through a single generic authorization framework with no acknowledgment that patient self-access is a distinct right with its own legal protections. The primary form is digitally authored but not fillable, includes no submission instructions, and leaves critical fields (provider name, revocation address) blank. A patient attempting to request their own records online would download a form they cannot fill digitally, would not know where to send it, and would receive no guidance about fees, timelines, or their rights. The experience reflects organizational indifference to patient self-service rather than intentional obstruction.

# Baptist Health Lexington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Baptist Health Lexington is a community hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, part of the Baptist Health (Kentucky) system. It does not maintain facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it relies on system-wide forms published by the parent system at baptisthealth.com. Three documents were retrieved, all system-level.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found:

1. **Form 1 (Primary):** "Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — the current system-wide authorization form, revised February 2026. A 3-page, dual-purpose document covering both patient self-access ("Myself" checkbox) and third-party release ("Other person/organization" checkbox). Includes delivery method options (paper, fax, email, CD, MyChart), record type packages, sensitive information consent, and a helpful "Tips" page. Submission is via fax or mail to a centralized Release of Information office in Louisville.

2. **Form 2:** "Request for Medical Records" — a simpler, 1-page patient-access-specific form hosted on the MyChart portal (mychart.baptist-health.org). Explicitly framed for patients requesting their own records. Dated July 2019, making it nearly seven years old. Notably, it contains no submission instructions — no address, fax number, or email.

3. **Form 3:** An older, undated version of the same system-wide authorization (Form 1). Two pages, still publicly accessible alongside the 2026 version at a non-versioned URL, creating potential patient confusion.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Baptist Health demonstrates partial differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (Form 1) is a generic HIPAA authorization, but it clearly labels a "Myself" option on its first page and notes that purpose of release is "not required if being disclosed directly to patient." A dedicated patient access form (Form 2) does exist but is outdated and lacks submission instructions, making it less useful in practice. The primary pathway a patient would encounter — through the medical records page at baptisthealth.com — is the generic authorization form with a patient self-access checkbox.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Basic web searches and the organization's medical records page led directly to downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The only friction is that a patient searching specifically for "Baptist Health Lexington" must recognize that the parent system's form applies. The coexistence of old and new form versions at similar URLs is a minor navigational hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (Form 1) is digitally authored with a text layer and clean typography, but has **zero fillable fields**. All entry areas are blank lines and non-interactive checkbox graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is well-organized with clear section headers (Patient Info, Release To / Delivery Method, Purpose, Information to Release) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. The record type "Package" system (Key Documentation vs. All Documentation) with detailed descriptions is genuinely helpful. The third page ("Tips for Requesting Medical Record Copies") provides useful practical guidance including a 15-calendar-day turnaround goal, MyChart default delivery, and contact information.

Language is mostly plain on page 1 but dense with required legal text on page 2 — HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder (42 CFR Part 2), revocation rights, and re-disclosure warnings. The sensitive information consent is bundled as an all-or-nothing authorization with no opt-out for individual categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Not fillable:** Despite being digitally created, no forms offer interactive fields — a significant missed opportunity.
- **SSN collection:** The last 4 digits of SSN are requested without being marked optional, exceeding what HIPAA requires for patient identification.
- **Sensitive information bundling:** The authorization bundles consent for mental health, HIV/AIDS, and substance use disorder records with no ability to exclude specific categories.
- **Outdated form still live:** Form 3 (undated older version) remains publicly accessible and could lead patients to use a superseded form with a potentially incorrect mailing address.
- **No fees mentioned:** While appropriate for patient access under HIPAA, the absence of any fee information leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart as default delivery:** If no delivery method is specified, records default to the patient's Baptist Health MyChart account — a patient-friendly, electronic-first approach.
- **Package-based record selection:** The tiered Package 1/Package 2 system with clear descriptions simplifies an inherently complex choice.
- **Toll-free phone support:** Contact information includes both local and toll-free numbers, plus a dedicated MyChart support line.
- **15-day turnaround goal:** Proactively commits to a faster-than-required timeline (HIPAA allows 30 days).
- **Multiple delivery options:** Paper, fax, email, CD, and MyChart cover a wide range of patient preferences.

## Overall Assessment

Baptist Health Lexington, through its parent system, provides a competent but conventional records request process. The primary form is well-organized and clearly accommodates patient self-access, but the reliance on a non-fillable PDF and fax/mail submission keeps this firmly in the traditional paper-workflow category. The existence of a dedicated patient access form (Form 2) shows awareness of the distinction, but its outdated status and missing submission instructions undercut its value. The bright spots — MyChart default delivery, helpful tips page, and clear package descriptions — demonstrate patient-centered thinking within the constraints of a legacy form design.

# Synthesis: Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers

## Overview

Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers (Philadelphia, PA) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC historically focused on HIV/AIDS care. The organization maintains a well-organized "Forms and Consents" page on its website with direct PDF download links, offering forms in both English and Spanish. Two ROI-related forms were found: a dedicated patient access form (form-1) and a separate third-party authorization form (form-2).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Philadelphia FIGHT stands out by maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access and third-party release** — a best practice that many larger organizations fail to implement. Form-1, titled "Patient Request for Access to Information," is explicitly designed for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524). It opens with a clear rights statement and deals exclusively with the patient's own records. Form-2, the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Information," is a standard § 164.508 authorization for third-party disclosures. This structural separation means patients requesting their own records are not funneled through a generic authorization workflow designed for insurers, attorneys, or other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Forms and Consents page is accessible via the main navigation (About → Forms and Consents) and was surfaced quickly by a site-specific web search. Direct PDF download links with descriptive text ("Request for Access to Information Form") made identification easy. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or other technical obstacles were encountered. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-fill or PDF annotation workarounds. This is a meaningful gap given that the form was clearly authored digitally (7 fonts, embedded logo) and could easily have been made interactive.

The form's structure follows a logical flow: patient identification, scope of request (entire medical record, billing record, or specific records), access method (copy vs. inspection), format preference (paper or electronic with a "Specify" field), delivery method (pick up or mail), and requester identification (self, guardian, or representative). At one page, it is appropriately concise.

The language is moderately complex. The introductory paragraph front-loads legal information about timelines, fees, and denial rights in dense prose. While accurate, it could be more accessible if broken into bullet points. The form does not use explicit section headers beyond the internal-use divider.

## Submission Methods

Form-1 lists four submission channels: in-person, email (privacy@fight.org), fax (215-732-1145), and mail. The inclusion of **email submission** is a notable strength — many organizations limit submission to fax and mail. A patient can complete and submit the form without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **Fee language is vague**: The form describes four categories of chargeable costs (labor, supplies, postage, summary preparation) but provides no dollar amounts, fee schedule, or cost estimates. Costs are billed after fulfillment, with no mechanism for a patient to learn the cost in advance or set a spending limit.
- **No mention of right to appeal a denial**: The form states FIGHT may deny access but does not inform the patient of their right to request review of a denial, which HIPAA requires for reviewable denials under § 164.524(d)(4).
- **Response timeline stated**: 30 days, with possible 60-day extension — consistent with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **Email submission option** in addition to fax, mail, and in-person — a low-barrier digital channel.
- **Electronic format option** with an open "Specify" field, respecting the patient's right to choose format.
- **Adolescent self-access at age 13+**, reflecting Pennsylvania minor consent law.
- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) on the Forms and Consents page.
- **Sensitive information opt-out** on the third-party form, with granular categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) — especially relevant for this organization's patient population.

## Overall Assessment

Philadelphia FIGHT delivers an above-average patient access experience among FQHCs. The structural decision to separate patient access from third-party authorization is the standout feature, demonstrating clear understanding of HIPAA's distinct provisions. The form is concise, logically organized, and offers multiple submission channels including email. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a print-and-fill workflow), vague fee disclosures, and the omission of denial appeal rights. With relatively modest improvements — adding fillable fields and clarifying fees — this organization could achieve an excellent rating.

# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

MUSC Health provides five documents related to medical records release: the current English authorization form (form-1, Rev. 10/2023, 2 pages), an older superseded version (form-2, Version 11, dated 11/2017), a dental-specific variant (form-3, Version 9, dated 5/2019), a MyChart instructions guide (form-4, 4 pages, dated 2017), and a Spanish translation of the current form (form-5). The primary form for patient self-access is form-1, the current "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information."

Critically, MUSC offers three distinct request pathways clearly presented on its medical records page: (1) MyChart Patient Portal for existing portal users, (2) an online eRequest wizard via Ciox/Swellbox for fully digital submission, and (3) manual form download for traditional mail/fax/email submission. This multi-pathway approach gives patients genuine flexibility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MUSC does differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — but at the process level, not the form level. The MyChart instructions document (form-4) explicitly states that MyChart is for patient self-requests, while the HIPAA authorization form should be used "for medical records to be sent directly to a physician office, hospital or third parties." The medical records webpage reinforces this distinction through its tabbed layout.

However, the downloadable PDF form itself (form-1) is a generic HIPAA authorization serving all purposes. "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" is listed as one purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care," "Legal," "Insurance," and others. The form does not distinguish the legal basis, fee structure, or processing rules for patient access under 45 CFR §164.524 versus third-party authorization — even though it cites that regulation. A patient using only the form must navigate a document designed around the third-party release paradigm.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability is excellent. The medical records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and all three pathways are clearly presented. Web searches for MUSC records release forms return direct PDF links. No bot-blocking or access difficulties were encountered. The form URLs are descriptive and intuitive. Both English and Spanish versions are co-located under a clearly labeled section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-authored, text-layered PDF with clean layout and logical flow: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Record Types → SUD Records → Purpose → Date Range → Release Method → Authorization/Consent → Signature. At two pages, the length is appropriate — page one handles all authorization substance, page two provides a useful facility contact directory for nine MUSC Health locations across South Carolina.

The most significant technical shortcoming is that the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being revised in October 2023. Patients must print the PDF and handwrite all entries, then fax, scan-and-email, or mail the completed form. This is a missed opportunity for a major academic medical center's current-revision document.

Record type options are granular and well-designed, including a dedicated Substance Use Disorder section with proper 42 CFR Part 2 citation and opt-in choices. Delivery options include mail, MyChart, fax, and encrypted email. However, the encrypted email option creates confusion: the checkbox says "Encrypted E-mail" but the accompanying consent language warns about "unencrypted e-mail" risks, leaving patients uncertain about what they're authorizing.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — not required by HIPAA — paired with a header warning that "FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION." Together, these could prevent a patient completing the form at home without a witness from submitting it.

Fee language references only South Carolina law ("fees may be charged as provided by S.C. Law") without acknowledging HIPAA's more restrictive cost-based fee limits for patient self-access requests. The MyChart instructions document goes further, stating a blanket fee "for all patient requests" with a prepayment requirement and no disclosed amounts — a notable compliance concern.

The form requires attaching a copy of photo identification, which is reasonable but adds friction for remote submission.

## Strengths

MUSC's standout features include: a **Spanish-language form** that faithfully mirrors the current English version with professional translation quality; **three clearly presented request pathways** including a fully digital portal option (Ciox/Swellbox); a **comprehensive nine-location facility directory** with fax numbers, phone numbers, and dedicated ROI email addresses; **granular SUD records consent** with correct 42 CFR Part 2 citation; and an **explicit citation of 45 CFR §164.524** (patient right of access).

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health demonstrates strong organizational infrastructure for records access — excellent findability, multiple pathways, bilingual support, and process-level differentiation between patient and third-party requests. However, the core downloadable form remains a generic authorization that doesn't center patient self-access, the PDF is not fillable despite a 2023 revision, and compliance details around fees and the witness requirement introduce unnecessary friction. The availability of the Ciox/Swellbox portal partially mitigates the form-level weaknesses by offering patients a fully digital alternative. Overall, this is a competent but not exceptional approach from a well-resourced teaching hospital.

# Synthesis: Essentia Health-Fosston

## Overview

Essentia Health-Fosston is a critical access hospital in Fosston, MN, part of the regional nonprofit Essentia Health system. The facility does not maintain its own medical records forms; it uses system-wide Essentia Health documents for all records-related processes. Four documents were retrieved, but only one — the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (form-1, EH10843 12/25) — is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records. The other three documents serve adjacent purposes: MyChart portal enrollment (form-2), MyChart proxy access delegation (form-3), and verbal information-sharing authorization (form-4).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Essentia Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting records on behalf of someone else. Form-1 is a general-purpose authorization with "From" and "To" fields designed for transferring records between entities. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both fields — putting themselves as the recipient — and check "Personal use" as the reason. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and no tailored instructions for self-access requests. That said, Essentia Health does offer meaningful alternatives: the medical records page directs patients to **MyChart** as the primary access pathway and provides a **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** as a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link, and Essentia Health's medical records page (`essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`) is well-organized with clearly labeled download links. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was required. The URL structure is clean and descriptive. All forms are hosted on the main Essentia Health domain (except the MyChart-related forms on `essentiamychart.org`).

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page**, digitally-designed PDF with a complete text layer — impressively compact for the scope it covers. The layout follows a logical flow from patient demographics through release details, record type selection, delivery method, and legal notices. The form offers strong record type granularity with 18+ individual checkboxes plus an "All Routine Records" shortcut, and appropriately separates behavioral health and substance use disorder records with distinct opt-in/opt-out controls.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally composed. All data entry uses blank underscores, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a consistent pattern across all four Essentia Health forms and appears to be a deliberate system-wide design choice rather than a per-form oversight. The delivery method options are a bright spot: patients can receive records via MyChart, email, fax, or mail (paper or disc).

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unusual barriers — no notarization, no witness requirement (except for mark-based signatures), no in-person-only submission. Submission is available via email, fax, or mail. Fee language is vague: "I may be required to pay a fee for retrieval and photocopying of records," citing state statutes rather than HIPAA cost-based fee limits, with no specific amounts disclosed. The form properly includes anti-conditioning language, revocation rights, psychotherapy note protections, and 42 CFR Part 2 SUD protections. One notable issue: the MyChart enrollment forms (form-2, form-3) collect partial SSN, which is unnecessary for portal access and creates data minimization concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** provides a fully digital alternative pathway
- **Single-page form** — remarkably compact for comprehensive ROI coverage
- **Electronic delivery options** including email and MyChart — not just fax/mail
- **Multi-state legal compliance** across MN, WI, and ND
- **Recently revised** (December 2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Well-organized medical records page** with clear navigation and multiple pathway options

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization
- **Zero fillable fields** across all four system forms — entirely print-and-handwrite
- **Vague fee disclosure** with no specific amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee reference
- **Form-3 (MyChart proxy)** published as a proof copy with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers
- **Behavioral health opt-out vs. SUD opt-in** inconsistency may confuse patients

## Overall Assessment

Essentia Health-Fosston earns a **B grade**. The organization benefits from its parent system's well-organized web presence, a compact and recently-updated authorization form, and the availability of a digital request portal. The main limitations are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients must use a generic third-party authorization form) and the absence of fillable fields on any PDF form. The Swellbox portal partially compensates for the PDF's technical shortcomings, and the multiple electronic submission and delivery options keep the process accessible. A patient can successfully request their records without visiting the facility, but the process isn't designed around them.

# Bath Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Bath Community Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Hot Springs, Virginia. The organization offers a single ROI form for medical records requests, hosted on its website. No patient portal, online request wizard, or alternative digital pathway was identified.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a one-page "Request of Information" PDF (`form-1.pdf`) branded under **Bath Community Physicians Group** rather than Bath Community Hospital itself. This branding mismatch is common among small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative infrastructure. The form is hosted on the hospital's website at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf` and linked from the Patient Resources → Forms page.

The form is a generic release-of-information authorization — it uses a "Send / Receive" and "To / From" structure designed primarily for inter-provider record transfers, not for patient self-access. A patient wanting their own records would need to adapt the form by marking "Send" and writing in their own name and address as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA individual access rights, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. A targeted web search surfaced the PDF directly, and the hospital's website links to it from a clearly labeled "Medical Records Request" section under Patient Resources. The URL path is descriptive. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. For a small critical access hospital, the form is reasonably discoverable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **scanned paper document** with an OCR text layer — not a digitally-created or fillable PDF. Despite metadata suggesting 21 fillable fields, the field names are empty and the form functions as a flat scan that must be printed and completed by hand. The OCR layer contains numerous errors ("ERNOTE," "LABffEST RESULTS," "IMAGINE REPORTS," "DISHCHARGE SUMMARY"), rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers and text-based search tools.

At one page with approximately 15 patient-completed fields, the form is appropriately brief. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → authorization direction → destination → reason → record type selection → signature block. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records consent paragraph is somewhat dense. No instructions are provided for how to complete or submit the form.

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access requests. This creates a real barrier — a patient must find someone to witness their signature before submitting. The form also requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, raising privacy concerns for a document that may be faxed.

No fees are mentioned. No response time commitment is stated. Submission instructions are absent; the header includes a fax number (540-962-7881), suggesting fax is an available submission method, but this is not explicitly stated. No in-person-only requirement is stated, so fax submission appears available.

## Notable Strengths

The form correctly separates consent for alcohol/drug abuse and psychiatric records into a dedicated checkbox — proper 42 CFR Part 2 practice that many organizations neglect. It also includes a checkbox for patients to request a copy of their signed authorization, a HIPAA requirement that many forms omit.

## Overall Assessment

Bath Community Hospital provides a minimally functional pathway for patients to request their records, but the experience is not patient-centered. The form was designed for provider-to-provider transfers and requires patients to adapt it for self-access. The scanned-image quality, OCR errors, witness requirement, and lack of submission instructions all create friction. While the form is findable and brief, it reflects an older, paper-first approach to health information management typical of small independent facilities. A patient could complete the process, but would receive little guidance and face an unnecessary witness barrier along the way.

# Lexington Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lexington Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Lexington, Kentucky. Two ROI authorization forms were found on their website: a current 2024 version (form-1) co-branded with VitalChart, a third-party ROI processing vendor, and a legacy 2014 version (form-2) that remains publicly accessible but appears to be superseded. The 2024 form is the actively linked version on the Patient Forms page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

Lexington Clinic does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release" documents designed to serve all disclosure purposes — patient self-access, transfer of care, legal requests, and other third-party releases. However, form-1 includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Purpose of Disclosure," which effectively signals a Right of Access request even though the form never explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 or uses the term "Right of Access."

The organization funnels all records requests through VitalChart, which processes the authorization and fulfills the request. This vendor-mediated model means the patient completes a single generic authorization form and sends it to VitalChart rather than directly to Lexington Clinic's HIM department. No online portal or digital request wizard is available.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A straightforward web search returned direct PDF download links on the first attempt. The Patient Forms page at lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that the legacy 2014 form (form-2) remains publicly indexed and discoverable via search engines, with no version labeling or "superseded" notice — creating a risk that patients might find and use the outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally composed PDF with a clear text layer but **zero fillable fields** — a significant missed opportunity given its digital origin. A patient must print it, fill it by hand, and then submit it via mail, fax, or email to VitalChart. The layout is well-organized with six numbered sections following a logical "who → where → what → why → cost → sign" flow. Section headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are unusually conversational and patient-friendly for a medical-legal form. However, the legal disclosures in Section 6 shift to dense HIPAA boilerplate, and fitting everything onto one page makes the form somewhat dense.

Record-type granularity is good: patients can select specific providers, date ranges, conditions, and record subtypes (labs, radiology, office notes, immunizations, operative reports). Delivery options include mail, email, and fax (fax restricted to healthcare providers only). Email delivery to patients is a meaningful positive — many organizations offer only mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fee structure**: The form cites KRS 422.317, stating the first copy is free, with additional copies at $1.00 per page. While the first-copy-free provision is patient-friendly, the $1.00/page charge for subsequent copies may exceed HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based fee" limit for Right of Access requests. A $5.00 late fee and "non-refundable once services are rendered" language add financial friction not contemplated by HIPAA's access provisions.

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is not a HIPAA requirement for ROI authorization and raises privacy concerns.

**Submission ambiguity**: While VitalChart's mailing address, phone, fax, and email are listed at the bottom, the form never explicitly instructs patients on how to submit the completed authorization. A patient may be unsure whether they can email the completed form.

**No notarization or witness required** — a positive. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- First copy free with clear Kentucky statutory citation
- Email delivery available to patients (not just providers)
- Conversational, patient-friendly section headers
- Good record-type granularity enabling targeted requests
- Single-page, concise format
- Easy online findability

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Clinic provides a reasonably accessible records request process that clears several important bars: the form is easy to find, well-organized, and can be submitted electronically via fax or email to VitalChart. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization form design (no dedicated patient access pathway), and the potentially non-compliant fee structure for patient access requests hold it back from a higher rating. The organization's approach is typical of mid-sized independent practices that outsource ROI processing to a vendor — functional but not patient-centered.

# UAB Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UAB Hospital (UAB Medicine), a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, provides one of the clearer patient record request experiences encountered in this study. The organization maintains a dedicated medical records request page that explicitly separates patient self-access from third-party release, offering distinct downloadable PDF forms for each pathway. Three forms were retrieved: a patient self-access form (form-1), a Callahan Eye Hospital variant (form-2), and a third-party authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

UAB Medicine stands out by offering a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-1, "Patient Request for Own Medical Records") that is clearly differentiated from its third-party authorization form (form-3). The patient access form opens with an explicit rights-affirming statement: *"UAB Medicine recognizes a patient's right to access their own protected health information."* The medical records request page at `uabmedicine.org/pay-your-bill/medical-records-request/` routes patients to the correct form based on their need — self-access versus third-party disclosure — with separate download links. This is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the UAB Medicine website clearly organizes its medical records page. The patient access form has a descriptive URL and filename (`Patient-Request-own-medical-records.pdf`), making it identifiable even in search results. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Quality: The Primary Patient Access Form (Form-1)

Form-1 is a 2-page fillable PDF with **51 interactive form fields**, clean text extraction, and a logical layout. The form is structured into clear sections: patient demographics, recipient designation, sensitive records opt-in, date range, record package selection, delivery method, and signature. The language is generally plain and direct, though the tiered package system requires some cognitive effort to parse.

A standout feature is the **five-tier record package system**, offering graduated levels of detail from key clinical notes through the entire medical record. This gives patients meaningful control over scope rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice. Additionally, nine individual record-type checkboxes allow specific requests (operative reports, billing records, medication list, radiology images, etc.).

**Delivery options** are comprehensive: paper mail, in-person pickup, fax, CD, and email. Electronic delivery includes a clear notice about encryption and privacy. For form submission, patients can return the completed form by mail or **fax (205-930-6721)**, providing an adequate electronic submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no notarization or witness requirements. No in-person submission is required. There are no excessive procedural hurdles — a patient signs once and does not need to initial multiple clauses (unlike form-2's three-initial requirement). However, **fees are not mentioned at all** — neither confirming free patient access nor disclosing a fee schedule. This silence creates ambiguity for patients who may reasonably want to know costs upfront. Similarly, **no turnaround time** is stated.

One ambiguity warrants mention: the form asks patients whether to include psychiatric/substance use records (opt-in checkbox on page 1) but then includes blanket authorization language covering those same records in the signature block on page 2, creating a potential contradiction.

## Contextual Notes on Other Forms

Form-2 (Callahan Eye Hospital variant) serves the same self-access function but is notably inferior: it has **zero fillable fields**, requires print-and-handwrite completion, and is 3 pages despite offering less content (2 record packages versus 5). Its title conflates "Patient Access" with "Authorization for Use or Disclosure," and it omits the rights-affirming opening statement present in form-1. It also contains a pagination error ("Page 3/2"). However, the high-watermark principle means UAB is assessed based on form-1, not this weaker variant.

Form-3 is correctly scoped as a third-party authorization and is appropriately separate from the patient access pathway. Its text layer is completely garbled due to CID font encoding issues, creating accessibility barriers, but this does not affect the patient self-access assessment.

## Overall Assessment

UAB Hospital delivers an above-average patient record request experience. The dedicated patient self-access form with rights-affirming language, fillable fields, granular record selection, and multiple delivery options — combined with a well-organized website that clearly separates patient access from third-party release — places this organization among the better performers. The primary gaps are the absence of fee disclosure and turnaround time information. The form is not cutting-edge (no online portal or digital submission), but the fillable PDF with fax submission represents a solid, accessible workflow.

# Shannon Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Shannon Health, a nonprofit regional health system in San Angelo, TX, provides a single Authorization for Release of Information (ROI) form for all records requests. The form is available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful accommodation for the area's large Hispanic population. While the form is easy to find and includes several patient-friendly features, it follows the common pattern of routing patient self-access requests through a generic third-party release authorization rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Forms & Pathways

Shannon Health offers two downloaded documents, but they are functionally one form in two languages:

- **form-1.pdf** (English): "Authorization for Release of Information," revised 06/2024
- **form-2.pdf** (Spanish): "Autorización para la Divulgación de Información," identical structure

The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-1.pdf (English). The form includes a "Self" checkbox under the recipient field and "Personal Use" among purpose options, acknowledging patient access as a use case. However, the form's structure — with fields for recipient organization, address, phone, fax, and relationship — assumes a third-party release scenario. A patient requesting their own records must navigate these irrelevant fields, with no guidance on how to handle them when "Self" is selected.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal for record requests, and no separate streamlined process for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The website's navigation path — **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** — leads directly to a page with clearly labeled download links for both language versions. This is a 2-click path from the homepage. One minor friction point: web search results initially returned outdated URLs (`medical-record-authorization.pdf`) that produced 404 errors. The filenames were updated for 2025 without redirects, creating link rot. Navigating the website directly resolved this.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores for handwriting; no checkboxes are interactive. For a form dated 2025, this is a significant missed opportunity. Patients must print the PDF, hand-fill all fields, then scan or photograph it for electronic submission.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → substance use disorder options → format → legal terms → signature → return instructions. The flow is intuitive, and the form uses reasonably clear language, though page 2's legal disclosures are denser. The form provides granular control over record scope with approximately 15 record type checkboxes, a date range field, and hospital/clinic selection. The three-option handling of substance use disorder records (include all, exclude all, select specific) is well-designed.

Approximately 25 fields require completion, which is proportionate for a general-purpose ROI form but more than a dedicated patient access form would need.

## Barriers

**Fees**: The form states fees "may" be charged and requires the patient to "agree to pay accordingly" — without disclosing amounts or referencing applicable fee limits. This vague blanket acceptance is the most significant concern; a patient has no idea what they're agreeing to.

**No notarization or witness** required. **No in-person submission** required — email is explicitly listed as the "Preferred Method" via `ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org`. Mail and in-person delivery are also available. No fax submission is listed, but email more than compensates.

**Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) linked side-by-side on the records page — appropriate for San Angelo's demographics (~45% Hispanic)
- **Email as the preferred submission method** — unusually patient-friendly; most orgs default to fax or mail
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: MyChart portal access and encrypted email via ShareFile, in addition to paper, CD, pick-up, and mail
- **Non-conditioning disclosure**: Explicitly states Shannon cannot condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on signing the authorization — an important HIPAA protection many forms omit
- **Substance use disorder records handling**: Three clear options giving patients granular control over sensitive information

## Overall Assessment

Shannon Health delivers an above-average but not exceptional patient experience. The form is easy to find, reasonably well-designed, and submitted through a patient-friendly email channel. The bilingual offering and electronic delivery options are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (funneling patients through a generic third-party authorization), the absence of fillable fields in a 2025-edition form, and the vague fee disclosure prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process wasn't designed with that use case as the primary concern.

# AdventHealth Central Texas — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Central Texas is a nonprofit community hospital in Killeen, TX, part of the major AdventHealth system. Two ROI forms were found: a system-wide authorization form (form-1, ADV-800003A, rev. 2022) and a facility-specific "Request For Access And Authorization" form (form-2, AHCT 616, rev. 2005). Both were easily discoverable via web search, downloaded directly from the AdventHealth CDN with no barriers.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The facility-specific form (form-2) is the more relevant document for a patient requesting their own records. It explicitly includes a checkbox for "Provide me with access to the protected health information specified below" as its first option — a clear patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party disclosure. The system-wide form (form-1), by contrast, is architecturally a third-party disclosure form that funnels all requests through a "Disclose To" entity-naming structure. While it lists "Personal Use" as a purpose, a patient would need to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient.

The existence of both forms creates a "which form?" problem. Neither form references the other, and no landing page was found that explains when to use which. A patient could reasonably download the system-wide form first and never discover the more patient-friendly facility-specific version. That said, the facility-specific form does meaningfully differentiate patient access from third-party release — it presents four distinct action options (access, copies, disclosure to others, summary) rather than treating everything as a third-party authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search for "AdventHealth Central Texas authorization release health information medical records form PDF" surfaced both PDFs immediately. No bot blocking, login walls, or navigation mazes were encountered. The forms are hosted on AdventHealth's CDN at direct URLs. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — full marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are digitally created PDFs with extractable text — neither is a scan. However, **neither form has any fillable/interactive fields** (both have zero fillable fields per metadata). Every field must be completed by hand after printing. This is a significant gap, especially for the system-wide form revised as recently as 2022. The "Affix Patient Label Here" boxes on form-2 further signal a paper-first, in-facility design never adapted for remote digital use.

Form-2 (the primary patient access form) is 2 pages with approximately 20–25 fields. The first page is reasonably organized: action checkboxes, patient demographics, record type selection (12 categories plus catch-alls), and a disclosure recipient section. The second page is a dense block of legal "I understand..." statements followed by signature blocks. The legal language is moderately formal but comprehensible. However, the lack of bullet points or visual separation in the legal text makes it harder to parse.

The system-wide form (form-1) is more complex, with 12 numbered sections spanning 48+ checkbox options across medical/surgical and behavioral health record types. It is visually overwhelming for a routine records request.

## Barriers

**Witness requirement**: Form-2 requires a witness signature for all requests — not just behavioral health records. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access, making this an unnecessary barrier for patients completing the form at home.

**Fees**: Form-2 mentions a "reasonable, cost-based fee" but provides no specific amounts or fee schedule. The summary option pre-fills a blank for cost, setting an expectation of charges without transparency.

**90-day authorization cap**: Form-2 limits authorization to a maximum of 90 days, which is restrictive and conflates patient access requests (which don't require authorization under HIPAA) with third-party disclosure authorization.

**Wrong state law**: Form-1 references the "Illinois Mental Health and Development Disabilities Confidentiality Act" despite being served at a Texas facility — a clear legal citation error from a system-wide template not adapted for local jurisdiction.

**No notarization required**: Neither form requires notarization. Submission can be done by fax (254-526-7134) or mail, meeting the baseline for electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit patient access pathway**: Form-2's first checkbox is "Provide me with access to the protected health information" — a rarity that centers patient self-access.
- **Broad catch-all category**: Form-2 includes "Any other personally identifiable information used by AdventHealth Central Texas to make medical decisions about me" — an unusually expansive request option.
- **Local contact information**: Form-2 provides facility-specific phone and fax numbers, unlike the generic system form.
- **Secure email delivery option**: Form-1 offers secure email as a delivery method, more progressive than fax-only alternatives.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: Both forms correctly state that refusing to sign will not affect treatment or benefits.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Central Texas offers a mixed experience. On the positive side, the facility-specific form includes genuine patient access language and the forms are trivially easy to find online. On the negative side, neither form is fillable, the facility form is over 20 years old, a witness signature creates unnecessary friction, and the two-form landscape creates confusion about which to use. The organization earns credit for having a patient access pathway at all — many peers offer only generic third-party authorization forms — but the execution falls short of modern standards for digital accessibility and form hygiene.

# El Centro de Corazón — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

El Centro de Corazón is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Houston, Texas. It offers a single downloadable PDF form for health information disclosure — a bilingual (English/Spanish) "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information." This form is the only pathway available for patients seeking their own medical records, and it is oriented entirely toward third-party release of information rather than patient self-access.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page authorization for disclosure hosted on the organization's WordPress site. Page 1 is in English, page 2 is a Spanish translation. No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified. The form's fax number (713-926-9105) is printed on the document, suggesting fax is an accepted submission method, though this is not explicitly stated as a submission instruction. No email, portal, or other electronic submission options are mentioned.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

El Centro de Corazón does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses a "provide to / receive from (circle one)" structure that presumes records flow between El Centro and another entity. There is no "send records to me, the patient" option. Among the nine reason-for-disclosure checkboxes (Continuing of Care, Financial Insurance Verification, Legal Proceedings, etc.), none corresponds to "personal/patient request." A patient wanting their own records must use the "Other (Specify)" write-in, which is unintuitive and signals that patient self-access was not a design consideration.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), does not include any patient rights language, and does not ask how the patient would like to receive their records (mail, electronic, in-person pickup). This is a generic HIPAA authorization form pressed into service for all disclosure scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned a direct link to the PDF on El Centro's WordPress site. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication was encountered. The URL structure (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/...`) is a standard WordPress media path — functional but not linked from a clearly labeled "Medical Records" or "Patient Resources" page. The form appears to date from August 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive form fields). It must be printed and completed by hand — the design uses underscore-line blanks and a "circle one" instruction that are hallmarks of print-era forms. The text layer is present (not a scan), so the content is readable and searchable, but there is no digital-first workflow available.

**Field count** is modest: patient name, DOB, phone number, the other party's information, reason checkboxes, information-type checkboxes, a sensitive-information acknowledgment, and signature/date fields — roughly 12–15 fields per language. At one page per language, the form is compact and not overwhelming.

**Layout** is functional but dense. Section headers are minimal; the form flows as a single block of content. Language is relatively plain, though legal constructs appear ("I hereby authorize"). A grammatical error exists in both versions regarding re-disclosure language.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Witness signature line**: Present on both English and Spanish versions. HIPAA does not require a witness for authorization forms. While the line appears optional (no mandatory language), its presence may lead staff to enforce it as required, creating an unnecessary barrier.
- **Fee disclosure**: Vague — "I understand that I may be charged for the copies of health records I have requested" — with no specifics about amounts, HIPAA cost-based limits, or dispute processes.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization defaults to 90 days, which is reasonable for third-party disclosures but irrelevant for patient access requests (which must be fulfilled within 30 days).
- **No delivery format options**: The form does not ask how the patient wants to receive records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual (English/Spanish)**: Providing a full Spanish translation on the same document is a meaningful accessibility feature for an FQHC serving Houston's predominantly Spanish-speaking communities. This is uncommon and commendable.
- **Compact design**: One page per language avoids the multi-page complexity that discourages completion.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient self-access pathway**: The form's entire structure is oriented toward third-party disclosure. A patient exercising their Right of Access is a second-class user.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive fields; purely a print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Checkbox mismatch**: The Spanish version omits "Billing Records" as a checkbox option, creating a translation inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

El Centro de Corazón provides a findable, compact, bilingual form — but it is a generic third-party authorization that does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The non-fillable format, lack of patient rights language, ambiguous witness requirement, and vague fee disclosure all contribute to a below-average patient experience. The bilingual design is a genuine bright spot that partially offsets the form's structural shortcomings.

# Scenic Mountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Scenic Mountain Medical Center is a for-profit community hospital in Big Spring, TX, affiliated with a regional health system. The hospital's medical records page offers two pathways for requesting records: downloadable PDF authorization forms (in English and Spanish) and an electronic request option via a Sharecare/HDS platform. Two PDF forms were retrieved — an English authorization (form-1.pdf) and its Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are structurally identical general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

The most significant finding is that Scenic Mountain Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. Both PDF forms are titled "Patient Request / Authorization to Use and/or Disclose Protected Health Information," but their structure is that of a standard third-party authorization: Section 2 asks patients to name the recipient ("Person or Facility Name"), requiring a patient requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as both requester and recipient. The "Personal" checkbox under Purpose of Disclosure (Section 8) is the only accommodation for self-access, and there is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524. This means patients exercising their individual access rights are funneled through an authorization framework designed for third-party disclosures — a legally distinct process that may result in inappropriate application of authorization-based rules (restricted release signatures, purpose requirements) to what should be a straightforward access request.

The medical records page does mention an electronic request option via a Sharecare/HDS platform, which may provide a more patient-centered digital experience, but the primary downloadable forms do not reflect this differentiation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A web search for the hospital's medical records release form led directly to the medical records page at `scenicmountainmedical.com/medical-records/`, which provides clear download links for both English and Spanish PDFs. No bot blocking, authentication, or portal login was required. The PDFs are hosted on a secondary WordPress domain (`scenicmountainmedicalcenter.org`), which is slightly confusing from a URL standpoint but transparent to the end user. The page also provides phone and fax contact information.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and return the form. This is a significant missed opportunity: the structured layout with numbered sections, checkboxes, and signature lines would translate well to an interactive PDF.

The form is well-organized with 15 numbered sections following a logical progression: patient identification → recipient → delivery method → date range → record types → restricted release → exclusions → purpose → expiration → legal disclosures → signatures. Section 5 provides 11 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, imaging, discharge summary, etc.) with write-in options, giving patients meaningful control over their request. Section 7 allows patients to exclude specific visits — an uncommon and thoughtful feature.

The legal disclosures on page 2 (Sections 10–13) are dense paragraph-style text that will challenge many readers, but the front-page sections are clear and practical. The bold footer warning — "THIS AUTHORIZATION IS NOT VALID UNLESS ALL APPLICABLE ENTRIES ARE COMPLETED" — could discourage patients who find some sections inapplicable.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form's fee notice ("*fees may apply") is vague, providing no schedule, amounts, or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations for patient access requests. This ambiguity could deter patients. A witness signature line appears next to the patient signature but is not labeled as optional or required — if enforced, this would impose a barrier not required by HIPAA. No notarization is required, and multiple delivery methods (email, postal mail, in-person pickup) are offered. Fax is available for form submission, providing an adequate electronic pathway.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish-language form**: A fully translated Spanish authorization form is available, appropriately serving the demographics of West Texas. Both language versions are prominently linked on the same page.
- **Email delivery option**: The form includes email as a delivery method — uncommon among facilities and patient-friendly.
- **Granular scope controls**: Patients can select specific record types, specify date ranges, and exclude particular visits.
- **Practical expiration option**: The "until fulfilled" expiration choice is well-suited to one-time patient access requests.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient access differentiation**: The generic authorization framework is the only PDF-based option, conflating two legally distinct HIPAA processes.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Despite being digitally authored, the form requires printing and handwriting.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: No specifics on costs, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **Translation errors in Spanish form**: A grammatical error in the bold warning text and a duplicate "Ciudad" label where "Estado" should appear undermine the quality of the Spanish version.

## Overall Assessment

Scenic Mountain Medical Center provides an accessible and reasonably well-organized authorization form that is easy to find and available in two languages — a meaningful accommodation for its community. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable PDF format, and vague fee disclosures prevent it from achieving a patient-centered standard. The form serves adequately as a general-purpose authorization but was not designed with the individual patient requesting their own records as the primary use case. **Grade: C (3.30/5.00)**.

# Ascension St. Vincent's East — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension St. Vincent's East is a community hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the Ascension health system that has recently partnered with or been rebranded under UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). This branding transition is the defining feature of the patient experience: two forms exist on two different websites under two different organizational names, and a patient searching under the facility's commonly known name may land on the wrong (legacy) form.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF authorization forms were found:

- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An Ascension St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization To Disclose Protected Health Information" revised February 2022, hosted on `healthcare.ascension.org` in a URL path containing the word "legacy." This 2.8 MB, 2-page form is a general-purpose ROI authorization with no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. It collects Social Security Number, lists notarized signature among identity verification options, and requires a witness signature — all potential barriers. On the positive side, it explicitly cites CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access).

- **form-2.pdf** (current): A UAB St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records" dated February 2026, hosted on `uabstvincents.org`. This is the current, most relevant form. At 143 KB and 2 pages, it is a cleaner, digital-origin document. It explicitly lists "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department" as a selectable location and includes a checkbox for "me for my personal use" — a meaningful distinction from forms that only contemplate third-party release.

The best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-2, which accommodates patient self-access as a first-class option alongside third-party authorization.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Form-2 does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release via a checkbox ("me for my personal use" vs. "the party indicated below"). This is a genuine improvement over many ROI forms and over this facility's own predecessor form. However, form-2 remains a generic authorization form — not a dedicated patient access request form. The same form, same legal language, and same process apply whether the patient wants their own records or is authorizing release to an insurer or attorney. A patient must navigate legal language about re-disclosure, initial two dense paragraphs about revocation and non-conditioning, and understand which fields apply to their scenario.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form required moderate effort. Initial searches for "Ascension St. Vincent's East" yielded system-wide Ascension forms from other states. An Alabama-specific search found the legacy form-1 on the Ascension domain. Only a separate search for "UAB St. Vincent's" uncovered the current form-2 on the UAB domain. A patient who knows this facility by its Ascension name would likely find only the outdated 2022 form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed — both PDFs downloaded directly.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a digital-origin PDF with a text layer, reasonable file size, and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all entries must be handwritten after printing. The form uses horizontal rules to separate sections and offers a well-designed tiered record selection (Key Clinical Notes bundle, Entire Medical Record, or specific report types). The "Key Clinical Notes" option — pre-defined as discharge summary, operative reports, labs, radiology, and ED documentation — is a genuine usability bright spot that helps patients who don't know medical terminology.

The opening paragraph front-loads dense legal language before the patient even fills in their name. The form contains a contradictory treatment of sensitive records: the opening paragraph states the request "includes" psychiatric and substance use information, while a later checkbox asks whether to include it. The submission instructions are indirect — rather than printing a mailing address, the form directs patients to visit a website.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-2 removes several barriers present in the legacy form: no Social Security Number field, no notarization option, no witness requirement. Non-conditioning and revocation rights are clearly stated (with initialing required). However, the form provides no fee disclosure whatsoever — patients have no idea what records will cost. The HIPAA Right of Access citation (CFR 164.524) present in form-1 was dropped in form-2, a notable regression. Submission appears limited to physical mail; no fax number or electronic submission option for the completed form is stated.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension St. Vincent's East earns credit for a reasonably well-designed authorization form that explicitly accommodates patient self-access with a personal-use checkbox and offers tiered record selection. However, the experience is undermined by the branding transition that makes the current form hard to find, zero fillable fields requiring a fully paper workflow, apparent mail-only form submission, and absent fee disclosure. The result is a facility that has the right instincts on patient-centeredness but falls short on digital accessibility and transparency.

# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Newton-Wellesley Hospital (NWH) is a community hospital in Newton, MA, part of the Mass General Brigham (MGB) health system (formerly Partners HealthCare). For medical records requests, NWH uses the system-wide MGB authorization form rather than a facility-specific document. Two forms were found: the current MGB-branded authorization (form-1, dated 06/2024) and a legacy Partners HealthCare version (form-2, dated 01/2006) that remains accessible at an orphaned URL on nwh.org but is no longer linked from current navigation.

## Access Pathway

NWH does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary (and only current) form is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" designed to serve all release scenarios — patient self-access, third-party release to insurers, attorneys, and other recipients. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form as someone authorizing release to a third party, selecting "Personal" as the purpose and checking a box to have records mailed to their own address. While functional, this approach requires patients to identify which sections apply to them and which to skip, without explicit guidance distinguishing patient access rights from third-party authorization.

The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. It frames the interaction as an "authorization" rather than a right, which is technically appropriate for third-party releases but conceptually misaligned for patient self-access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The NWH website provides a clear navigable path (Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records), though this redirects to the MGB parent system's medical records page where the user must expand a "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" accordion to access the download. This extra indirection is minor. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1) is a high-quality digital artifact. It features **78 fillable/interactive form fields** — checkboxes, text inputs, and date fields are all functional for on-screen completion. The form is organized into five clearly lettered sections (A through E) with a logical flow: patient info → permission/purpose → record types → sensitive information → understanding/signature. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The header prominently displays submission instructions (mailing address and fax number), and the form offers four delivery methods for the records themselves: Patient Gateway (portal), Secure Email, Fax, and Paper Copy via Mail. The inclusion of electronic delivery options is a notable strength.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though Section D (sensitive information authorization) contains dense regulatory text, particularly the 42 CFR Part 2 disclosure. This is legally required but not reader-friendly.

**Multilingual support** is a bright spot: the MGB medical records page offers the form in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

## Barriers

**Notarization**: Not required. Only a patient signature is needed.

**Fees**: The form subtly differentiates — copying fees are asterisked only for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes, while "Personal" and "Medical Care" are not marked, implying no fees for patient access requests. However, this is implicit rather than explicitly stated.

**Date requirement**: Section C states patients "MUST specify dates" (capitalized emphasis) for each record type category. HIPAA does not require patients to specify date ranges, and this requirement could function as a barrier for patients seeking comprehensive access to their records.

**Outside records carve-out**: Records from outside providers held by MGB will not be released unless the patient specifically requests them under "Other" — placing a knowledge burden on patients who may not know what outside records exist in their file.

## Strengths

- 78 fillable form fields enabling genuine digital completion
- Four delivery methods including portal and secure email
- Trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Portuguese)
- Implicit fee exemption for patient access requests
- Clean, well-organized layout with clear section headers
- Easy findability via web search or website navigation

## Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway; generic third-party authorization form only
- "MUST specify dates" requirement potentially exceeds HIPAA requirements
- No explicit statement of patient Right of Access
- Outside records require special knowledge to request
- Submission limited to fax or mail (no online form submission)

## Overall Assessment

Newton-Wellesley Hospital, through its parent system MGB, provides a technically well-executed authorization form that is easy to find and genuinely usable digitally. The form's 78 fillable fields, multilingual availability, and multiple delivery options represent above-average document quality. However, the organization does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, funneling all requestors through a generic authorization form. The "MUST specify dates" requirement and lack of Right of Access framing are missed opportunities to center the patient experience. Overall, this is a competent but generic approach — the form works, but it wasn't designed with the patient requesting their own records as the primary audience.

# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Providence St. Vincent Medical Center does not publish facility-specific ROI forms. All record request forms are managed at the parent system level by Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), a major nonprofit health system spanning seven states. Three overlapping forms were found on the Providence HIM page:

1. **Form-1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" (ORC 240A, rev. 03/20): A general-purpose ROI authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Includes a "Self" checkbox but is framed around disclosure to others.
2. **Form-2** — "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" (940507, dated 3/27/25): A dedicated patient access form with updated PSJH branding and R1RCM vendor contact info. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
3. **Form-3** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" (rev. 03/20): An older OR/MT-specific patient access form that form-2 appears to supersede, with outdated PH&S branding and contact information.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence meaningfully distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Form-2 is explicitly titled as a "Patient Request to Access" and defaults to disclosure "to Myself" as the first option. This is a genuine dedicated patient access form — not a generic authorization repurposed with a self-access checkbox. However, the general authorization (form-1) is more easily found via web search, meaning a patient may encounter the less appropriate form first. The HIM page does not clearly guide patients toward form-2 over form-1.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required pivoting from the facility name to the parent system. A search for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center" did not surface ROI forms directly — searchers had to navigate to the system-level HIM page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management`. Once found, this page is comprehensive, listing multiple forms with instructions. However, the presence of three overlapping forms with no clear guidance on which is current creates confusion. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2, the primary patient access form, is a well-constructed digital document. At 3 pages and 72 fillable fields, it is genuinely interactive — patients can complete nearly every field digitally before printing for signature. The layout uses clearly labeled sections (patient information, use and disclosure, record type selection, rights statement, signature) with capitalized headers. Record type options are helpfully tiered: "Pertinent information" (with an explanatory list of common record types) versus "All/Entire Medical Record," plus an "Other" field and "Last two years only" option.

The language is mostly clear, though the title uses the HIPAA term "Designated Record Set" rather than plain-language alternatives. The opening warning — "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — is somewhat intimidating without clarifying which fields are required versus optional.

Five delivery options are offered: MyChart, Paper (Mailed), CD (Mailed), FAX, and Email. Including MyChart is a notable patient-friendly touch. Submission can be made by mail, email (ROIHIMreception@r1rcm.com), or fax — no in-person visit is required.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable barrier is the wet-signature requirement on forms 1 and 3, though form-2 may accept electronic signatures (it lacks the explicit "Print form and sign by hand" instruction found on the others). Fees are disclosed vaguely — "there may be a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access.

A potential red flag appears in form-2's internal "HOSPITAL USE ONLY" section, which includes a physician approval/denial workflow for record release. Under HIPAA § 164.524, denial of patient access is permitted only in narrow circumstances; a blanket physician-approval gate could constitute an unreasonable barrier if applied broadly.

The continued publication of the outdated form-3 alongside form-2, with different contact information and organizational branding, risks sending patients to non-functional channels.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from general third-party authorization
- **72 fillable interactive fields** on the primary form — genuinely digital-first design
- **Five delivery format options** including MyChart and email
- **Multilingual language assistance notices** in English, Spanish, and Chinese
- **Multiple submission channels** (mail, email, fax) with no in-person requirement
- **Comprehensive HIM page** with centralized ROI processing

## Overall Assessment

Providence St. Vincent, through its parent system, provides an above-average patient record request experience. The existence of a dedicated patient access form with strong digital fillability and multiple delivery options demonstrates genuine attention to patient needs. The main weaknesses are findability (requiring navigation from facility to system-level resources), form proliferation without clear versioning guidance, vague fee disclosures, and the physician-approval gate embedded in form-2's workflow. A patient who finds form-2 will have a good experience; the challenge is ensuring they find it.

# Heartland Community Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Heartland Community Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Lawrence, Kansas, serving patients across three locations. The organization provides a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" — for all records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party release.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page PDF titled "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" (form-1.pdf), hosted in the organization's WordPress uploads directory. This form serves all release purposes — patient access, provider-to-provider transfers, insurance disputes, and referrals. A "Patient's Request" checkbox appears among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Records From" and "Records To" fields) is oriented around third-party transfer rather than individual access. A patient requesting records for personal use would find it unclear how to complete the "Records To" section.

Submission options are reasonable: email (medrecords@heartlandhealth.org), fax (785-856-0375), and mail. A phone line for questions (785-842-4477, Option 5) is also provided. These multiple channels meet the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was not discoverable through generic web searches but was found via a site-scoped search (`site:heartlandhealth.org`). The URL is descriptive and the download was straightforward once located. The form is not prominently linked from obvious patient-facing pages — it lives in a WordPress uploads directory, suggesting it may be embedded on an interior page but is not surfaced in primary navigation or a patient resources section.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally-created, single-page PDF with a full text layer — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it functions as a print-and-handwrite document. The layout is logically ordered (demographics → record types → delivery method → from/to → purpose → legal disclosures → signature → return instructions) and fits everything onto a single page, though the density is high with 16 fonts and tight spacing.

The form uses approximately 20+ data entry points (name, DOB, address, phones, date ranges, multiple checkbox groups, records from/to blocks, signature lines). The opening line — "To treat you effectively, your provider needs to review your past medical records" — is patient-friendly, though it subtly frames the form around incoming records transfer rather than patient-initiated access.

One notable design feature is the pre-bundled "Record Set" option, which offers a thoughtfully curated default bundle (last 3 visit notes, recent labs, medication list, immunization records, screening reports, and specialist list). This reduces decision burden for patients who want comprehensive records.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Witness requirement**: A "Witness" signature line is present but never explicitly stated as required. Its inclusion may deter patients or create confusion about whether a witness is actually needed.

**Mental health records**: These require a completely separate form and cannot be combined with other record types on the same submission, creating an additional barrier for patients seeking comprehensive records.

**Email liability disclaimers**: Two separate liability waivers for email delivery appear on the form, which may discourage patients from choosing this convenient option.

**Fees**: No fees are mentioned anywhere on the form — neither disclosed nor waived.

**Compliance language**: The form properly addresses revocation rights, 12-month expiration, treatment non-conditioning, and re-disclosure warnings. However, it does not reference the patient's Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Overall Assessment

Heartland Community Health Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The form is accessible online (with some searching), offers multiple submission channels, and includes some patient-friendly elements like the pre-bundled record set and plain-language opening. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party release framing, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of any dedicated patient access pathway all work against patient-centeredness. The form is adequate for its purpose but was not designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. For an FQHC serving a population that may face literacy or technology barriers, the non-fillable format and dense layout represent meaningful obstacles.

# University of Mississippi Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

UMMC provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (Form #1862) in two language versions. Form-1 is a Spanish-language version (Rev. 05/2025) retrieved from the Wayback Machine, and form-2 is an older English-language version (Rev. 04/2018) obtained from a third-party caching site (pdf4pro.com). Both are one-page PDFs covering all UMMC locations. No dedicated patient access form, online portal, or web-based request wizard was identified. No separate fee schedule or patient rights document was found.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UMMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to third parties — the "Release to" field and purpose options like Legal/Attorney, Insurance, and Workers' Compensation reflect a third-party orientation. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal" as the purpose and enter their own contact information in the "Release to" field, which is a confusing and unintuitive workflow. Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or informs patients of their affirmative right to access their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **extremely difficult**. The English PDF link on UMMC's website returns HTTP 404, and an older compliance-page URL is also broken. Five different retrieval strategies were attempted: direct web search, curl (failed due to DNS), Wayback Machine, browser-based archive navigation, and finally a third-party cache. The Spanish version was the only form still live at its canonical URL. The English form was only available via pdf4pro.com — a source no typical patient would find. This represents a critical findability failure for a major teaching hospital: a patient visiting the UMMC website today and clicking the Release Form link reaches a dead end.

## Form Document Quality

Using the **high-watermark principle**, the Spanish form (form-1) is the better document: it has 70 fillable/interactive fields, a native text layer, and was clearly designed as a digital-first PDF. The English form (form-2) has zero fillable fields and requires printing and handwriting. Both forms share identical structure: location selection → patient info → release-to info → purpose checkboxes → 14 record-type checkboxes → sensitive information initials → patient rights paragraph → signature block with witness. The layout is logically organized but cramped, fitting everything onto a single page at the cost of readability. The Patient Rights section is a dense, unbroken paragraph of legal text with no bullet points or visual hierarchy. Three delivery formats are offered — Paper, Electronic, and "View Access as scheduled" — but none are defined, and critically, **no submission instructions appear on either form** (no fax number, no mailing address for initial submission, no email, no portal link).

## Barriers

- **Witness signature required**: Both forms mandate a witness, which HIPAA does not require. This is a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.
- **SSN collection**: Both forms request the patient's full Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates identity theft risk.
- **Incomplete forms rejected**: The header warns that incomplete forms will not be accepted, but does not clarify which fields are mandatory.
- **No fee disclosure**: Neither form mentions fees, costs, or the patient's right to cost-based pricing.
- **No submission instructions**: A patient completing the form has no way to know where to send it.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering Spanish and English versions is a genuine accessibility strength, especially for Mississippi's growing Spanish-speaking population.
- **Fillable PDF (Spanish version)**: 70 interactive fields allow digital completion.
- **Electronic delivery option**: The form explicitly offers "Electronic" as a delivery format.
- **Granular record selection**: 14 specific record categories with a clarification that "Entire Medical Record" does not include images — a helpful transparency measure.
- **"Personal" purpose option**: Including this among pre-printed options legitimizes patient self-access.

## Overall Assessment

UMMC provides a generic, moderately well-designed authorization form that serves patients as an afterthought rather than a primary audience. The critical findability failure — a broken English PDF link on the organization's own website — is the most acute problem: a patient cannot currently obtain the form from UMMC online. The Spanish version survives but would not serve most English-speaking patients. The witness requirement and SSN collection add unnecessary friction. The absence of submission instructions is a significant gap. While the Spanish form's fillable fields and bilingual availability are genuine positives, the overall experience reflects an organization that has not prioritized patient self-access as a distinct use case.

# UCSF Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UCSF Medical Center offers a single ROI form — the "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (756-020Zi, Rev. 04/22) — available in both English and Spanish. Two English PDF URLs exist (form-1 and form-2 contain identical text; form-2 at `/pdf/roi-authorization.pdf` is the current canonical version linked from the Medical Records page). The Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 05/22) is also directly linked. The UCSF Health Medical Records page (`ucsfhealth.org/medical-records`) additionally mentions MyChart as an alternative pathway for accessing records and discloses fees ($0.25/page paper, $25 electronic).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

UCSF does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. The authorization form is a general-purpose release designed for any disclosure — from continuity of care to billing to third-party requests. A patient wanting their own records must fill in both the "I authorize [source]" and "to release health information to [recipient]" fields, effectively authorizing release *to themselves*. While "At the request of the patient/patient representative" is available as a purpose checkbox, the form makes no distinction between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) and a third party requesting records. There is no mention of HIPAA's individual access right, no response-time commitment, and no EHI export option. MyChart provides a separate digital pathway, but the PDF form is the primary documented process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. The first web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link. The UCSF Health website has a clean, well-organized Medical Records page that links to both language versions, describes the process, and discloses fees. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript-only rendering was encountered. The only minor wrinkle is two English URLs serving essentially identical PDFs, which could confuse a patient who finds the older link via search.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **well-crafted, digitally-authored 2-page PDF** with 39 fillable interactive fields. It is not a scan — it has a clean text layer, uses 14 fonts, and includes no embedded images. An accessibility note ("Made accessible 12/18" on form-1; "Made accessible 7/23" on form-3) confirms deliberate remediation for assistive technology. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → source/destination → purpose → record types → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Parenthetical examples for each record type (e.g., "Entire Hospital Record (e.g. History and physical, consult, operative report, discharge summary…)") help patients understand their options. The sensitive-information section correctly requires separate opt-in for substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing records, with California statute citations.

However, there are quality issues: a typo ("specifcally") appears in both English versions, and the Spanish version has three spelling errors ("fnalidad," "específca," "tratatmiento") plus a missing radiology request section that exists in the English versions — a meaningful content gap for Spanish-speaking patients.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no excessive barriers**: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person submission mandate. Fees are disclosed on the website (not the form) at $0.25/page or $25 electronic — within HIPAA limits. The "Your Rights" section clearly states the authorization is voluntary, explains revocation rights, and notes the right to a copy.

The primary submission gap is that **general (non-radiology) requests must be mailed** to physical addresses in San Francisco or Oakland. Only radiology requests have fax and email submission options. The form itself provides no electronic submission path for general authorizations, creating a workflow disconnect: a patient can fill the form digitally but must then print and mail it.

## Overall Assessment

UCSF Medical Center earns credit for form findability, document quality, Spanish-language availability, and clean sensitive-information handling. The main weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients navigate a generic third-party release form), the mail-only submission requirement for general requests, and quality control gaps in the Spanish translation. The org demonstrates institutional attention to accessibility and transparency, but has not yet designed its records request process around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Lexington Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Lexington Medical Center (West Columbia, SC) publishes three documents on its Medical Records page at lexhealth.com/medical-records: an English-language "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (form-1), a full Spanish translation of the same form (form-2), and a supplemental Reproductive Health Attestation form (form-3) implementing the 2024 HIPAA privacy rule. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-1, a two-page general-purpose ROI authorization. The website also mentions MyChart as a digital option for records requests, though that portal-based pathway was not directly evaluated.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lexington Medical Center does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic authorization: "I authorize the following provider/entity _____ to release my health information to: Recipient/Provider Name: _____." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly designate themselves as both the authorizer and the recipient — an unintuitive workflow. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no separate patient access form, and no language explaining that patients have a legal right to obtain their own records. The form funnels all requests — whether to insurers, attorneys, family members, or the patient themselves — through the same third-party release authorization framework.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the Medical Records page, which links directly to all three PDFs. No bot blocking, no JavaScript rendering issues, and no portal login was required. The Medical Records page provides context for both digital (MyChart) and paper-based requests. This is a well-organized web presence for records access information.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a digitally-authored, text-based PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores and all checkboxes are non-interactive symbol characters. Patients must print and complete the form by hand. The layout is well-organized into three clear sections: patient identification and routing, medical records release details with a granular record-type checklist (~25 categories), and review/authorization terms with a signature block. At two pages, the length is appropriate. Language is moderately formal — not impenetrable legalese, but not plain language either. The authorization conditions (Section 3) use standard legal register that most adults could follow with careful reading.

Submission is limited on the form itself: the only method stated is postal mail ("Mail completed form to: Lexington Health Attn: Medical Records, 2720 Sunset Blvd."). However, Condition 6 states that "a copy or fax of this document is just as valid as the original document," implying fax submission would be accepted, though no fax number is provided for the records department. The website separately references MyChart for digital requests.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness signature** is required — a welcome absence. The form also explicitly accepts copies and faxes as valid. However, there are notable concerns:

- **Full SSN collection**: The form requests the patient's complete Social Security Number as a top-level identifier, which is unnecessary for HIPAA purposes and creates identity theft risk on a document designed to be mailed.
- **Blanket substance abuse/psychiatric disclosure**: Condition 1 states that alcohol abuse, psychiatric, drug abuse, and communicable disease records "will be released" with no opt-out, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records.
- **Undisclosed fees**: Patients are told "there may be a charge" and must call (803) 791-2264 to learn the amount — no upfront fee transparency.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization expires in 90 days, which is short but generally adequate for a single records request.

## Notable Strengths

The **Spanish-language version** (form-2) is a full professional translation co-located with the English form — not buried in a separate section. It uniquely includes an interpreter services phone number with conference call instructions, a thoughtful accessibility touch. The **granular record-type checklist** gives patients meaningful control over what gets released. The **Reproductive Health Attestation** (form-3) demonstrates proactive compliance with recent HIPAA regulatory changes, ahead of many peer organizations.

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Medical Center makes its forms easy to find and offers a well-organized, bilingual paper-based workflow. However, the process fundamentally treats patient self-access as indistinguishable from third-party release, requiring patients to navigate a generic authorization form not designed for their needs. The non-fillable PDF and mail-only submission (on the form itself) create unnecessary friction in an era of digital health records. The SSN collection and blanket substance abuse disclosure represent compliance concerns. The organization earns credit for findability, bilingual access, and clear layout, but falls short on patient-centeredness and technical accessibility.

# Gritman Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Gritman Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Moscow, Idaho. The organization provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form for all records requests. There is no patient portal–based request option and no dedicated patient access form — patients requesting their own records use the same document as those authorizing release to a third party.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page fillable PDF titled "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (revised 4/1/2024). This form serves both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios, with "RELEASE TO" and "RELEASE FROM" sections on the same document. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), and no patient portal–based request pathway.

The form is linked from the "My Health Records" page on Gritman's website, reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → My Health Records). A web search also surfaces the form quickly. Findability is strong for a small rural hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Gritman does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic HIPAA authorization — a patient requesting their own records fills out the same "RELEASE TO" / "RELEASE FROM" fields as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of the 30-day response requirement, and no guidance distinguishing the patient's stronger legal protections for self-access. The "Purpose" checkboxes include "Personal" as an option, which is the closest the form comes to acknowledging patient self-access, but it carries no special treatment.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **63 fillable fields**, meaning patients can complete it digitally before printing or submitting. It is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient information, release parties, delivery method, purpose, treatment dates, information types, authorization language, and signature. The layout is compact but organized, with clear section headers.

Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legal terminology. The "I UNDERSTAND THAT" section is dense but covers the key compliance elements (revocation, re-disclosure, non-conditioning). The sensitive-information disclosure statement is appropriately specific, listing behavioral health, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing, sickle cell anemia, and substance abuse.

The form offers **five delivery methods**: standard mail, fax, email, pickup, and certified mail. Email availability is a meaningful bright spot — uncommon among small rural facilities. Submission method is less clear: the form header lists a phone number and fax number but does not explicitly instruct patients on how to return the completed form. Patients could reasonably fax it to the listed number.

Field names are absent from the fillable fields, creating an accessibility gap for screen readers. The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Barriers

- **Fees**: The form notes "Continuation of Care (no fee)" for that purpose, implying fees for other purposes including personal requests, but provides no fee schedule or cost estimate. Certified mail carries an unquantified "Add'l Charge."
- **No notarization or witness** required — just patient/guardian signature.
- **No in-person requirement** stated; the fax number in the header provides a reasonable electronic submission pathway.
- **90-day auto-expiration** with a one-year maximum is reasonable.
- **Submission instructions are absent**: No explicit guidance on how to return the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery option** — unusual for a critical access hospital and valuable for rural patients who may live far from the facility.
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific report type checkboxes give patients fine-grained control.
- **"Major Documents for the Last 3 Years"** shortcut — a thoughtful option for patients who don't know exact treatment dates.
- **Recently revised (4/1/2024)** — evidence of active form maintenance.
- **63 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive PDF, not a flat scan.

## Overall Assessment

Gritman Medical Center provides a competent, recently updated, fillable ROI form that is easy to find and reasonably well designed. Its main weakness is the lack of differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — patients are funneled through a generic authorization form that doesn't acknowledge their stronger rights under HIPAA's individual access provisions. Fee transparency is also lacking for personal-use requests. Despite these gaps, the form's fillable fields, email delivery option, and granular record selection make it a serviceable tool for a patient requesting their own records. For a small independent critical access hospital, this represents a solid but not exceptional effort.

# Pocahontas Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Pocahontas Memorial Hospital (PMH) is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Buckeye, West Virginia. Two PDF forms were found on the hospital's Medical Records page: a general-purpose **Authorization for Release of Medical Information** (form-1, 2 pages) and a narrowly scoped **COVID-19 Testing Authorization** (form-2, 1 page). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own records; form-2 is a pandemic-era authorization for releasing COVID test results to employers or schools.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Form

PMH does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole route for a patient requesting their own records is the generic HIPAA authorization form (form-1), which is designed to handle all release scenarios — personal use, insurance, attorneys, and other third parties. The form does include "Personal use" as the first option under Purpose of Disclosure, and a patient can name themselves as the recipient, but the overall structure (recipient fields, entity authorization, third-party delivery options) is oriented toward release to others. There is no separate patient access request form, online portal, or patient portal–based request workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required moderate effort. A general web search for PMH authorization forms returned generic template sites rather than the hospital's own link. A site-scoped search (`site:pmhwv.org`) succeeded, and the form is linked from a logical location: Patients and Visitors > Medical Records. Bot protection on the website blocked direct programmatic (curl) downloads, requiring a browser-based workaround. A patient navigating the website directly would find the form in 2–3 clicks, which is reasonable for a small facility.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscored lines requiring the patient to print and handwrite. The form is 2 pages with approximately 15–18 fields covering patient demographics, record type selection (about 10 checkbox options), date range, sensitive information opt-outs, purpose of disclosure, recipient information, and delivery preferences. The logical flow is sensible: patient info → what to release → purpose → recipient → delivery → authorization → signature.

Layout is functional but minimal. There are no bold section headers, boxed regions, or strong visual hierarchy beyond the document title and some capitalized labels. The sensitive information opt-out section is a dense paragraph with inline initial-lines that could be difficult to parse. Language is a mix of plain phrasing and standard legal boilerplate; the authorization paragraph on page 2 is a single dense block. A notable text encoding defect drops the "ti" ligature throughout the PDF (rendering "Patient" as "Pa ent," "authorization" as "authoriza on," etc.), which breaks screen readers and text search — a significant accessibility flaw.

## Submission Methods & Delivery Options

The form offers multiple submission and delivery options: in-person pickup (self or authorized representative), US Mail, fax (304-799-2276), and email. Format options explicitly include Paper and Electronic (email, USB, CD, Portal, other). This is a notably comprehensive set of electronic delivery options for a small critical access hospital. Since fax is available, a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Compliance

**No notarization required** — only a patient signature. The form includes a clear **non-conditioning statement** ("may not condition its providing of health care on whether copies... are released"), an unusual and commendable inclusion for a small rural facility. A **30-day response time** is stated, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Revocation and re-disclosure language are present and standard.

However, the form states **"Photo ID is required"** as a blanket requirement without clarifying whether this applies only to in-person pickup or also to mailed/faxed requests — a potential barrier for remote patients. **Fee disclosure is vague**: "All other requestors are charged as state and federal laws allow" provides no specific amounts, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. These are not dealbreakers but reflect areas where the form could better serve patients.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Electronic format options explicitly listed (email, USB, CD, Portal); multiple delivery methods; non-conditioning statement included; 30-day response time stated; logical form flow.

**Red flags**: Zero fillable fields despite being digitally created; blanket photo ID requirement; vague fee disclosure; systematic text encoding defect affecting accessibility; "Snowshoe Mountain Clinic" listed as a record type alongside clinical categories (confusing).

## Overall Assessment

PMH provides a functional but unexceptional records request process typical of a small independent critical access hospital. The form is findable, logically organized, and offers commendable delivery flexibility. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, zero fillable fields, and several barrier concerns prevent it from rising above average. The form adequately serves a patient who knows what they need, but it wasn't designed with the patient self-access use case as a priority.

# Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center provides two distinct PDF forms for health information requests, both accessible from a centralized, facility-specific medical records page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/medical-records-wa/sacred-heart`:

1. **Form 1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" — a general third-party authorization form for disclosing records to an external recipient (insurer, attorney, another provider, etc.). 2 pages, 37 fillable fields.
2. **Form 2** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — a dedicated patient access form for individuals requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). 2 pages, 45 fillable fields.

The facility also offers Spanish versions of both forms, plus additional forms for amendments, accounting of disclosures, restriction/revocation, and Health Information Exchange opt-out — a comprehensive suite rarely seen at individual facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release. The dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" form uses correct HIPAA terminology and is purpose-built for patients requesting their own records. This separation is a significant strength — many organizations force patients through a single generic authorization form regardless of whether they want their own records or are authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was effortless. A single web search returned direct links to the facility-specific medical records page. The page is cleanly organized, with clearly labeled PDF download links and no bot blocking, login walls, or portal gatekeeping. URL naming is descriptive (`wa-sacred-heart-access-designated-record-set.pdf`), and the page is reachable through Providence's main navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form 2 — Primary Patient Access Form)

Form 2 is a natively digital 2-page PDF with 45 interactive fillable fields — checkboxes for record types, delivery formats, and text fields for demographics and date ranges. The form is not an image scan. Page 1 provides instructional text and institutional notices; page 2 contains the input fields. The layout is clean and logically organized.

Five delivery format options are offered: MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, and Fax. The MyChart integration is particularly strong, meeting patients where they likely already have an account. Patients can select specific record types, date ranges, and facilities. A "Last 2 years only" convenience checkbox is a practical touch.

The language is reasonably plain, though it includes some boilerplate legal text. The form includes multilingual language assistance notices (English, Spanish, Chinese) with a toll-free phone number and TTY access. Spanish versions of both forms are separately available.

## Barriers

**Signature**: Both forms require a wet signature ("Print form and sign by hand"), which prevents fully digital completion despite the otherwise comprehensive fillable fields. This is the single most significant barrier.

**Fees**: Form 2 states "Fees may be associated with this request" without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based fee standard. Patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by fax ((509) 474-4815), email (PSHMC.HIMRecords@Providence.org), or mail — multiple remote submission options are available, so in-person delivery is not required.

**No notarization** is required. **No response time** is stated.

## Red Flags and Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The patient access form (form 2) includes a liability release clause typically found on third-party authorization forms, which is inappropriate for a patient exercising their Right of Access. The form also lacks any explicit statement of patient rights (right to receive records, 30-day response timeline, right to appeal denial).

**Bright spots**: The dedicated patient access form, five delivery formats including MyChart, multi-facility awareness ("we would be glad to fax a copy of this form to other facilities"), the centralized portal with Spanish translations, and the proactive SSN disclosure warning on form 1 all demonstrate above-average patient-centeredness.

## Overall Assessment

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center offers one of the better patient access experiences among community hospitals. The existence of a dedicated patient access form, five electronic delivery options, and an exceptionally well-organized web portal demonstrate genuine investment in patient-centered records access. The wet signature requirement and vague fee language are the main drawbacks, preventing a top-tier score. The organization earns a strong B overall — clearly above average, with room for improvement in digital workflow completion and rights transparency.

# U.S. Dermatology Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides a single ROI form — "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — available as a one-page PDF from their Patient Forms page. Two copies were found online: form-1.pdf (uploaded March 2020, currently linked) and form-2.pdf (uploaded June 2019, orphaned but still publicly accessible). Both contain identical text, with a revision footer of "Rev 08/2017," indicating the content has not been substantively updated in nearly nine years. For patient self-access purposes, form-1.pdf is the relevant document.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Instead, it uses a generic HIPAA authorization form that bundles patient self-access with third-party release scenarios. "Patient Access" appears as one checkbox among five under "Purpose of Use/Disclosure," alongside "To Doctor," "To Insurance," "To Attorney," and "Other." The overall framing — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure" — is oriented toward third-party release, and a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form structure designed for a different purpose. For example, the recipient section asks for "Name of individual or organization" and its address, which is confusing when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" surfaced the PDF directly, and the Patient Forms page at `usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/` has a clearly labeled "Medical Records Release" link. No bot blocking, login wall, or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields** (`fillable_field_count: 0`), requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and physically sign. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow with clear sections for patient identification, disclosure direction, delivery method, purpose, date range, record types, and rights disclosures. Language is somewhat legalistic but generally readable. The form lacks instructions on where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is provided.

## Delivery and Submission

The form lists three delivery options for records: mailed, faxed, or electronic (patient portal only). However, these describe how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself is *submitted*. The form is silent on submission method, leaving patients without guidance. Given the lack of submission instructions and the non-fillable PDF, the workflow is effectively: download → print → hand-fill → unknown submission. The patient forms page and general website would likely require calling the office to determine where to send it; fax is presumably available once the patient contacts the office.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions**: The most significant usability gap. A patient who completes the form has no idea where to send it.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure," bundled into the authorization with no opt-out. This is overreaching for patient self-access requests.
- **Vague fee language**: "A reasonable fee may be charged for the records" does not distinguish patient-access requests (HIPAA-limited) from third-party releases, and gives no indication of actual costs.
- **Typo**: "IDS" instead of "AIDS" in the sensitive information disclosure — uncorrected since 2017.
- **No response time commitment**: No mention of turnaround time or the 30-day HIPAA requirement.
- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive fields despite being a digitally created PDF.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: The entire authorization fits on one page without being cramped — a respectful use of patient time.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment" is unambiguous and well-placed.
- **Easy online findability**: Directly linked from a well-organized Patient Forms page with clear labeling.
- **Patient rights disclosures**: Five bullet points covering right to a copy, right to inspect, right to revoke, voluntariness, and sensitive information notice.

## Overall Assessment

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides an easily findable, concise ROI form that technically accommodates patient self-access through a checkbox — but the form is fundamentally a third-party authorization repurposed for all disclosure scenarios. The lack of fillable fields, missing submission instructions, bundled liability waiver, and vague fee language collectively create a paper-era experience with notable friction points. The form has not been meaningfully updated since 2017. A patient can likely get their records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience around patient self-access as a first-class use case.

# Massachusetts General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), part of the Mass General Brigham system (formerly Partners HealthCare), provides a single general-purpose authorization form for all records release requests. Three versions of this form were found at different URLs, representing the form's evolution from 2016 through 2024. The current version (form-1.pdf, MGB00087 06/24) is the clear best-available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Forms and Pathways

All three downloaded documents are versions of the same form — "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information." The current version is hosted on the parent system domain (massgeneralbrigham.org), while two older versions persist at legacy URLs on massgeneral.org. There is no dedicated patient access request form, online portal, or web-based request wizard. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it, and submitting via mail or fax.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MGH does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The same authorization form serves patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient selects "Personal" from the purpose checkboxes and checks a box to have records mailed to their own address. The form references HIPAA authorization requirements (§ 164.508) but never mentions the patient's Right of Access under § 164.524. This means a patient requesting their own records navigates a process designed primarily for third-party disclosure — workable, but not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, CAPTCHAs, or login requirements. The main concern is that two superseded versions remain publicly accessible at legacy URLs, creating a risk that patients could download an outdated, non-fillable version. The current form lives on the parent system domain rather than massgeneral.org, which could confuse patients who start at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a 2-page digitally native PDF with **78 fillable interactive fields** — a significant upgrade from the older versions, which had zero fillable fields. The form follows a clear A–E section structure: patient information, permission to share, information to be released, sensitive information consent, and terms/signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and logical flow.

Language is moderately plain — straightforward instructions at the top, clear section labels, and accessible phrasing in most areas. The required regulatory language in Section D (42 CFR Part 2 for substance use records) is necessarily dense but presented legibly. Section E's terms are written in clear, formal prose with important patient protections stated explicitly ("This authorization is voluntary"; treatment will not be conditioned on signing).

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: Patient Gateway (patient portal), secure email, fax, and paper mail — giving patients genuine electronic options for record receipt. However, submission of the form itself is limited to mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No electronic form submission**: Despite 78 fillable fields enabling digital completion, the form must be printed and mailed or faxed. Fax is an adequate electronic pathway per study criteria, so this is not a major penalty, but the gap between fillable fields and fax-only submission is a missed opportunity.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form notes "Copying fees may apply" for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes. Personal and Medical Care are not asterisked, implying no fees — but this is never stated affirmatively. HIPAA limits fees for patient access, and this distinction deserves explicit clarification.
- **Mandatory date specification**: Patients "MUST specify dates" for every record type requested, with no "all records" option. This could burden patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Stale versions at legacy URLs**: Two outdated, non-fillable versions remain publicly accessible, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Fillable PDF with comprehensive field coverage** (78 fields) — active investment in digital accessibility
- **Four electronic delivery options** including patient portal and secure email
- **Granular sensitive-information consent** with seven separate opt-in categories (HIV, genetics, substance use, mental health, social work, domestic violence, sexual assault)
- **Clear non-coercion statement** and voluntary authorization language
- **No notarization or witness required**
- **Version-controlled form** with clear identifiers (MGB00087 06/24)

## Overall Assessment

MGH provides a competent, well-structured authorization form with strong technical execution (fillable fields, electronic delivery options) but falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form. The form is easy to find, clearly organized, and free of major barriers. The primary gaps are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, ambiguous fee language, and the persistence of outdated form versions online. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process was designed for institutional release workflows rather than individual access rights.

# Community Health Center, Inc. — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Middletown, Connecticut. Three PDF forms were retrieved: a standard English ROI authorization (form-2, Rev. 6/2019), a Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 7/2019), and a site-specific variant pre-filled for the Birth to Three early intervention program (form-1). The standard English form (form-2) is the most relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway and Patient Self-Access

CHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All three PDFs are variants of a single generic "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information" — a dual-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for both releasing records to third parties and obtaining records from other providers. However, the form does include an explicit self-request section: "If to ME, my records should be released via: Mail / Fax / Pick-Up / E-Mail." This accommodates patient self-access but does not distinguish it as a separate regulatory pathway (§164.524 Right of Access vs. §164.508 third-party authorization).

The patient forms page on chc1.com has transitioned from direct PDF links to Luma Health online portals for ROI requests. Two Luma Health links are now offered ("CHC to release health information to another agency" and "CHC to obtain health information from another agency"), suggesting the organization is modernizing its workflow. The site also references a myCHC patient portal for online record access. The legacy PDFs remain hosted in the WordPress uploads directory but are no longer linked from the patient-facing navigation.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability was **moderate**. The patient forms page is navigable, but the PDF forms themselves are legacy documents — discoverable only via web search or URL pattern guessing. The current site directs patients to Luma Health portals. No bot blocking or download difficulties were encountered; all PDFs downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-2) is a well-organized **single-page** document with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of disclosure → self-request delivery options → record type checkboxes → date range → sensitive information opt-ins → reason → expiration → legal notices → signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and a side-by-side column design for the "Release TO" vs. "Obtain FROM" paths.

The form is **not fillable** — zero interactive PDF fields despite being a digitally authored document. All blanks are underscored lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. Submission is via fax (860-343-7379) or mail (575 Main Street, Middletown, CT 06457). A patient would need to print the form, fill it by hand, and fax or mail it in.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though the legal disclosure paragraph at the bottom is dense. The form provides approximately 20 fields for a self-request (patient demographics, delivery method, record types, date range, reason, signature block). Record type options are granular (9 categories plus "Other"), and patients can specify date ranges and selectively exclude sensitive information.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fax submission is available, so physical delivery is not the only option. No fees are mentioned. The form states a 30-day fulfillment window, consistent with HIPAA requirements.

Two minor compliance concerns: (1) the form asks for a reason for the request (Legal, Transferring Care, etc.), which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA; and (2) the default scope is the last 3 years unless a broader range is specified — this could inadvertently limit patients who don't realize they must explicitly request their full record.

A typo persists in the legal text ("in response to his authorization" instead of "this authorization") across both English forms.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version** available — important for an FQHC serving a diverse Connecticut population
- **Email delivery** offered as a self-request option, which is uncommon and reduces barriers
- **Granular exclusion controls** for drug/alcohol information (patients can specify what to exclude, not just all-or-nothing)
- **Transition to Luma Health portal** suggests active modernization of the records request process
- **Single-page design** keeps the form concise and manageable

## Overall Assessment

CHC provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient self-access. The generic authorization form accommodates self-requests via a dedicated delivery section, and the availability of a Spanish translation and email delivery are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of fillable fields, the conflation of patient access with third-party release, the legacy status of the PDF forms, and minor compliance gaps (reason field, default 3-year scope) prevent the organization from scoring higher. The transition to Luma Health portals is promising but could not be fully evaluated. **Grade: C** — adequate with notable room for improvement.

# Blessing Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Blessing Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Quincy, Illinois, part of Blessing Health System. Five documents were retrieved — three superseded English versions (April 2023 and 2015), the current English authorization form (September 2025), and a current Spanish translation. The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf**, the September 2025 English "BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information," which is directly linked from the organization's Medical Records page alongside its Spanish counterpart (form-5.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Blessing Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary pathway is a **generic HIPAA authorization form** used for all releases of information — patient self-access, third-party disclosures, insurance, legal, and care transfers alike. The form uses bidirectional "RELEASE RECORDS FROM" / "RECORDS GOING TO" fields designed for inter-party transfers. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively authorizing the release of records from Blessing to themselves. The purpose options include "Personal reasons," which accommodates patient requests but does not distinguish them legally or procedurally from third-party authorization.

Notably, the retrieval notes indicate that Blessing Health also offers an **online records request tool** with identity verification via driver's license photo, mentioned on the Medical Records webpage. This provides a parallel digital pathway, though the PDF form remains the primary documented route.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Blessing Hospital authorization forms immediately returned direct PDF links, and the Medical Records page at blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords is well-organized under "For Patients > Request Medical Records." The one concern is version sprawl: three outdated English versions (from 2015 and April 2023) remain accessible at their original URLs with no deprecation notices or redirects. A patient arriving via a cached search result could unknowingly download a superseded form — including one that still requires a witness signature the organization has since eliminated.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4.pdf) is a **digitally authored, non-fillable 2-page PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks must be filled by hand after printing; circle instructions ("(Circle) Pick up or Mail or Fax or Email") reveal its print-first design. Despite this, the form is well-structured: patient demographics flow into records source/destination, then record type checkboxes (15 specific categories plus "Other"), sensitive information authorization, purpose, legal disclosures, and signatures. A dedicated page 2 provides **field-by-field completion guidelines** with plain-language examples — a genuine standout feature that most organizations omit.

The language is a mix: legal boilerplate on the authorization side is moderately dense, but the guidelines page compensates with concrete, accessible explanations. One persistent grammatical issue ("I authorize the use or disclosure of the above named individual's health information, its employees and agents, to furnish") creates ambiguity about who is authorizing what.

## Barriers and Compliance

The September 2025 revision made a significant improvement by **removing the witness signature requirement** that was present in the April 2023 versions — a barrier the organization itself recognized as unnecessary. No notarization is required. Photo identification "may be required," using permissive rather than mandatory language. The form does not disclose fees, though the website mentions a $6.50 flat fee for certain requests; HIPAA requires patients to be informed of fees before authorizing. The mandatory date range requirement ("MUST specify date range") could create friction for patients seeking comprehensive records. Submission can be made via mail or **fax** to three listed locations (Blessing Health System, Blessing Health Hannibal, and Denman Services), so patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

Blessing Hospital demonstrates several above-average practices: a **Spanish translation** linked alongside the English form, the detailed **completion guidelines** on page 2, **email as a delivery option**, active form improvement (witness requirement removal), and an **online records request tool** as an alternative pathway. The form is managed through PolicyStat, suggesting systematic version control.

## Overall Assessment

Blessing Hospital earns a **B** grade. The organization provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed ROI form with helpful instructions and a Spanish translation — above average for a community hospital. However, the generic authorization design means patients requesting their own records must navigate a form not designed for them, and the non-fillable PDF format creates a paper-dependent workflow. The availability of an online records request tool and fax submission partially compensate for the print-and-fill form, but the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway and the absence of fee disclosure on the form itself are notable gaps.

# Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola is a community hospital in the Florida panhandle, part of the Ascension health system — one of the largest nonprofit Catholic health systems in the United States. The facility uses Ascension's market-specific forms for the Florida panhandle region rather than purely facility-level documents. Two PDF forms were found during retrieval, along with references to a Swellbox-powered online records request portal and an Ascension patient portal.

## Available Pathways and Most Relevant Form

Three pathways exist for patients requesting their own records:

1. **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary): The facility's medical records page directs patients to a Swellbox-powered online request wizard — a third-party vendor platform purpose-built for patient record requests. This is the org's preferred channel.
2. **PDF authorization form (form-1.pdf)**: A traditional single-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Information From Ascension Sacred Heart," form number FFM99-8700-010-00 (rev 8/20). This is the general-purpose ROI form covering four Ascension Sacred Heart facilities in the Florida panhandle.
3. **Ascension patient portal**: The medical records page also references the patient portal for direct record access.

A second PDF (form-2.pdf) was found but is irrelevant for patient self-access — it is a department-specific inbound records release for the Radiation Oncology department, designed for transferring records *from* other providers *to* Sacred Heart. It uses outdated "Sacred Heart Health System" branding, contains multiple typos, and dates from 2016.

**Form-1 is the most relevant downloadable document** for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does not offer a dedicated patient-access PDF form distinct from third-party authorization. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization form designed to cover all release scenarios — patients, insurers, attorneys, and other third parties all use the same document. A patient requesting their own records must check the "Patient Named Above" box to indicate they are both the patient and recipient, and select "At the request of the patient" as the purpose. This works but requires the patient to navigate a form designed for a broader audience.

However, the Swellbox online portal serves as a de facto dedicated patient access pathway. Online records request wizards are specifically designed for patient-initiated requests, providing a more guided experience than the generic PDF form. The existence of this portal partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated patient-access PDF.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. The primary PDF was discovered on the first web search using standard ROI-related keywords and downloaded without any bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or browser fallback requirements. The form is hosted on Ascension's content delivery system at a stable, descriptive URL. However, a patient navigating the website organically would be directed to the Swellbox portal rather than the PDF — the downloadable form is available but not prominently linked from the website's navigation.

## Form Document Quality (Form-1)

**Technical format**: The PDF has a text layer (not a scan) but zero fillable/interactive fields. All blanks are underscores — patients must print and handwrite. Despite being digitally authored with 7 embedded fonts, it was designed entirely for a print-and-fill workflow.

**Layout and organization**: The single-page form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient information → purpose → format preference → report type checkboxes → facility/date selection → sensitive information authorization → legal disclosures → signature. The checkbox layout for report types and facility selection is clean and practical.

**Language**: The upper portion uses reasonably plain language. The lower third shifts to dense legal text — the sensitive information authorization bundles HIV, AIDS, psychiatric conditions, substance abuse, sickle cell anemia, STDs, and hepatitis into a single all-or-nothing binary decision in one long sentence. The revocation rights section runs together without paragraph breaks.

**Instructions**: Minimal. There are no instructions for how or where to submit the completed form. A note warns: "If you fail to specify which records you desire, you will only receive a copy of the discharge summary" — defaulting to minimal disclosure when patients don't navigate the checkbox list correctly.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security Number as a standard field — unnecessary for patient access and creates identity theft risk.
- **Purpose marked "REQUIRED"**: HIPAA does not require patients to state a reason for accessing their own records, though the pre-printed "At the request of the patient" option reduces the practical burden.
- **Default to minimal records**: The discharge-summary-only default if record types aren't specified may result in patients receiving less than they're entitled to.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. Patients have no advance notice of potential fees.
- **Internal EHR navigation paths visible**: Staff-facing filing instructions appear in the form footer, suggesting the document wasn't reviewed for patient-facing use.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox online portal as primary pathway**: Directing patients to a dedicated digital request wizard is a significant positive.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: One form covers four Ascension Sacred Heart locations — patients with care across facilities don't need separate forms.
- **Electronic format option**: The form offers a choice between electronic and paper delivery, though "electronic" is undefined.
- **Concise single-page design**: All content fits on one page without excessive cramming.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola provides a **mixed but functional** experience. The organization's strength lies in offering a Swellbox online portal as the primary pathway — a genuinely patient-centered digital option. However, the fallback PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, unnecessary SSN collection, and no submission instructions. The form is easy to find but was clearly designed for institutional workflow rather than patient self-service. A patient who uses the Swellbox portal will likely have a reasonable experience; one who downloads the PDF will face a traditional print-and-mail workflow with some compliance concerns.

# Grady Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's major public safety-net hospital operating under Grady Health System, provides patients with a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Three PDF documents were found: a current authorization form (form-1, revised 2/22), an older superseded version (form-2, revised 5/15), and a combined instructions-plus-form package (form-3, bundling the older form with a COVID-era cover page). None of these forms are tailored specifically for patient self-access — all are structured as "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information," framing the process as a release between two parties rather than an individual exercising their right of access.

## Access Pathway

Grady does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting someone else's records. All requesters use the same authorization form with identical "Request Information From" / "Release Information To" fields. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively addressing the form to themselves. The form does include "Personal" as a purpose option, and the documentation requirements section on page 2 distinguishes "Patients Requesting Their Own Medical Records" from third-party requests — but this distinction lives in the supporting text, not in the form design itself. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the main authorization form and the medical records page at gradyhealth.org/medical-records/. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without login, bot blocking, or broken links. The medical records page provides clear context for the forms. This earns high marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the current primary form, is a 2-page digitally-created PDF with a text layer and clean layout. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. For a digitally-created document with 12 embedded fonts, this is a missed opportunity. The form is logically organized (demographics → from/to parties → date range → record types → purpose → format/method → legal notices → signature) with clear section delineation. The record type selection offers approximately 25 checkboxes across three categories (Hospital Visits, Office Visits, Diagnostic Imaging), giving patients granular control.

The language is mostly accessible, with the opening instruction plainly stating what the form does. However, the legal sections contain dense language including a broad liability waiver: "I will not hold Grady... responsible for anything that may happen from the use or release of my PHI." The completeness warning — "If any selection is incomplete, this form may be considered invalid" — could discourage submission if patients are uncertain about any field.

## Submission & Delivery

Critically, **submission options are limited to in-person drop-off and postal mail only**. The form-3 cover page explicitly lists only these two options for submitting the completed form. No fax number is provided for form submission, no email submission is available, and no online portal exists. This means a patient cannot complete the entire process without either physically visiting the hospital or waiting for postal mail.

For *receiving* records, options are better: the current form-1 offers encrypted email delivery, paper, CD, mail, pick-up, and fax (continuing care only). Form-3's cover page also references electronic delivery through CIOX Health (now Datavant), with 2-business-day processing for electronic and 7–10 days for mail.

## Barriers & Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The broad liability waiver bundled into the authorization is the most significant concern — patients should not be asked to waive accountability as a condition of records access. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which exceeds what's needed when photo ID is also required. Mandatory government-issued photo ID may burden patients of a safety-net hospital who lack such documentation.

**Bright spots**: The encrypted email delivery option on form-1 is genuinely uncommon and valuable. The form-3 cover page provides excellent operational guidance — processing timelines, fee disclosure ($6.50 max), and the note that continuing care requests are free. Multiple delivery format options (paper, CD, email) give patients real choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

Grady Memorial Hospital makes its forms easy to find and offers some progressive delivery options, but falls short on two critical dimensions: the forms are entirely paper-based (non-fillable, print-and-handwrite only) and submission requires physical delivery. The generic authorization form does not center patient self-access, and the liability waiver raises compliance concerns. For a major public hospital, the absence of any digital submission pathway and the reliance on a third-party release form for patient access represent meaningful barriers. **Grade: C.**

# Rio Grande Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rio Grande Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Del Norte, Colorado. It offers a single downloadable PDF ROI form — a generic "Authorization for Release of Information" — used across both the hospital and its affiliated clinic. Importantly, the organization also provides embedded HIPAA-compliant JotForms on both the hospital and clinic patient records pages, giving patients an online submission pathway alongside the traditional PDF.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one PDF form was retrieved: **form-1.pdf**, a one-page "Authorization for Release of Information" created in Microsoft Word 2013 and uploaded in December 2018. The same PDF is linked from both the hospital and clinic records pages. In addition, each page embeds a separate JotForm (hospital JotForm ID: 220685534838162; clinic JotForm ID: 220685679526166) for online submission, providing a digital-first alternative to the downloadable PDF. The "FOR OFFICE USE ONLY" section on the PDF also references fax and mail as delivery methods used by staff.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Rio Grande Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses classic third-party authorization framing — "I authorize ___ to disclose my individually identifiable health information" — requiring the patient to fill in both a "To" and "From" entity. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should list Rio Grande Hospital as the "From" and themselves as the "To," which is workable but unintuitive. The form does include a "Personal Use" purpose checkbox, which is the closest acknowledgment that patients may be requesting records for themselves. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524, and no mention of electronic health information export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Web searches quickly surfaced the hospital's patient records pages, and the PDF had a descriptive URL. The JotForms are prominently featured on the pages, while the downloadable PDF sits in the sidebar — meaning the online pathway is actually more visible than the print form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was required.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable document with zero interactive form fields. Despite being digitally created (not a scan), it uses underscored blank lines for handwriting — a print-era design. At one page, it is appropriately concise. The layout follows a logical sequence (patient identity → parties → record types → HIV authorization → purpose → legal terms → signature), but the opening authorization paragraph is a dense, multi-line sentence covering communicable diseases, mental illness, and redisclosure warnings all at once. Record type options are limited to four checkboxes (History/Physical, Lab Results, X-Ray Reports, Other Diagnostic Reports) with no option for "all records," discharge summaries, medications, or billing. The form opens with "THIS REQUEST MUST BE FILLED OUT COMPLETELY" in emphasized text — a stern tone that could discourage patients uncertain about fields like SSN.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flag is the **SSN collection** — the form requests Social Security Number as a standard identifier alongside name and DOB, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk. The form also provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or reference to the online JotForm. A patient who downloads and fills the PDF has no clear next step. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeframe is stated. The form does not require notarization or a witness.

## Notable Strengths

The standout bright spot is the **online JotForm submission option**. While not part of the PDF itself, the organization provides a fully digital pathway for records requests via embedded web forms on both hospital and clinic pages. This is a meaningful investment in patient accessibility. The form's **non-conditioning language** ("I understand that my health care and the payment of my health care will not be affected if I do not sign this form") is a positive HIPAA compliance element. The **single-page format** keeps things concise. The HIV/STD/AIDS opt-in/opt-out structure with patient initials properly addresses Colorado's heightened protections for sensitive health information.

## Overall Assessment

Rio Grande Hospital provides a functional but dated records request experience. The PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no patient-access differentiation, no fillable fields, an unnecessary SSN field, and no submission instructions. However, the organization partially compensates with its JotForm-based online submission pathway, which gives patients a digital-first alternative. The best available pathway for a patient is the online JotForm, though the PDF form — the only downloadable document — falls short of modern patient-centered design. For a small independent critical access hospital, the investment in online forms is commendable, but the underlying authorization framework remains oriented toward third-party release rather than individual access rights.

# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center provides three downloadable documents, but only one is relevant for patient self-access: **form-3.pdf**, the current "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (CONS00337, dated LRH 01/22). This single-page PDF is linked from the organization's [Medical Records page](https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/) and is the actively maintained ROI form. An older version of the same form (form-1.pdf, dated 04/16) remains publicly accessible at a separate URL but is no longer linked from the site. The third document (form-2.pdf) is an LRH Physicians Group Release/Authorization Form — a multi-purpose intake/consent bundle covering insurance assignment, billing, and treatment consent — and is not a patient-initiated records request form.

In addition to the PDF form, the organization offers a **Swellbox digital intake wizard** (http://www.swellbox.com/lakeland-wizard.html) as an alternative electronic pathway, which is a meaningful digital option for patients who prefer not to deal with paper.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lakeland Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (form-3) is a generic HIPAA authorization with bidirectional language — "to disclose my PHI to" and "to obtain my PHI from" — using checkboxes for each direction. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should check "to disclose my PHI to" and enter their own name and address as the recipient, an unintuitive workflow. There is no dedicated patient access form, no simplified request pathway, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). The form treats patient self-access identically to third-party release, including applying the same fee structure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Lakeland Regional Health medical records release form returned direct PDF links immediately, and the Medical Records page is straightforward to locate via site navigation. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor concern is that the superseded 2016 version remains publicly accessible without any "outdated" marking, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-3) is a **clean, digitally-authored single-page PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is logical and reasonably organized, flowing from patient identification through recipient details, date range, delivery method, record type checkboxes (13 categories plus "Other"), sensitive information notice, five legal clauses, and signature blocks. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — the numbered "I understand that..." clauses are reasonably accessible, though the fee reference to Florida statutes without disclosing actual amounts is opaque.

Three delivery options are offered: Paper, Electronic (email), and MyChart Patient Portal — a forward-thinking inclusion. The form provides granular record-type selection with 13 specific categories, and includes a patient-protective redaction option for mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records.

## Barriers

**Fee disclosure** is a notable weakness: patients must "agree to pay charges... per Florida Statute 395.3025 or Florida Administrative Code 64B8-10.003" without knowing what those charges are. This state fee schedule reference may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests, and the form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release fee structures.

A **witness signature line** appears on the form without clear indication of whether it is required or optional. If required, this creates a logistical barrier for patients completing the form at home or remotely. The form also collects the **last four digits of SSN**, which is unnecessary when MRN, name, DOB, and address are already requested. A "Photo ID verified" checkbox is ambiguous — if interpreted as requiring in-person ID presentation, it could conflict with electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Swellbox digital intake** provides a fully electronic alternative pathway
- **MyChart Patient Portal** as a delivery option leverages existing infrastructure
- **Granular record-type selection** (13 categories) gives patients meaningful control
- **Sensitive information redaction option** with explicit notice is a patient-protective feature
- **Single-page conciseness** keeps the form efficient and reduces patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Lakeland Regional Health provides a **serviceable but undifferentiated** records request experience. The form is easy to find, concise, and reasonably well-organized, with some genuinely patient-friendly features (granular record selection, redaction option, MyChart delivery). However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access, failing to disclose fees, and including potentially unnecessary requirements (witness, partial SSN). The availability of Swellbox as a digital alternative partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF, but the core form experience remains paper-first. The organization earns credit for accessibility and findability but loses ground on patient-centeredness and compliance nuances.
