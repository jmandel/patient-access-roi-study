# Surprising Findings — Batch 0

## The Only A Grade Belongs to a For-Profit Chain Hospital

The single organization earning an A grade across all 190 evaluated is **Flowers Hospital** in Dothan, Alabama — a for-profit Community Health Systems (CHS) facility. Its form features 66 fillable fields on a single page, a co-equal Spanish translation, a "Myself" option as the first recipient choice, and a Swellbox online portal alternative. This defies the common assumption that for-profit hospitals prioritize revenue over patient experience. Meanwhile, elite academic medical centers like UPMC Presbyterian (C), Ohio State Wexner (C), and UF Health Shands (C) scored far lower. For-profit hospitals as a group averaged 3.28 — essentially identical to nonprofits at 3.35 — challenging the narrative that ownership type predicts patient-centeredness in records access.

## The Provider-Form Irony

Several organizations demonstrate they *can* build good digital forms — just not for patients. **JPS Health Network** (Fort Worth, TX) publishes modern, fillable HIE forms from 2025, while its patient ROI form remains a 2018 image-only scan with zero text layer. **Neshoba General Hospital** (Philadelphia, MS) produced a 54-field fillable employer authorization form but offers patients no records request form at all. **Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers** (Chandler, AZ) invested in a 22-field fillable incoming-records form for providers while leaving its patient-facing release form non-fillable and orphaned on an undiscoverable URL. The pattern is consistent: organizations invest in forms that serve institutional workflows (employer authorizations, provider-to-provider transfers) while neglecting the patient-facing equivalent.

## FQHCs: Serving the Most Vulnerable, Scoring the Worst

Federally Qualified Health Centers — created to serve underserved populations — have the lowest average score of any facility type (2.96). Five of the seven organizations with phone-or-in-person-only pathways are FQHCs: **Aaron E. Henry CHC** (MS), **Franklin Primary Health Center** (AL), **People's Health Centers** (MO), **El Rio Health** (AZ), and **La Clínica de La Raza** (CA). These organizations provide no downloadable form at all. The irony deepens with **Sea Mar Community Health Centers** (Seattle, WA) — an FQHC whose name literally means "of the sea" in Spanish, founded to serve the Latinx community — offering only an English-language, non-fillable, apparently in-person-only form. Thirteen of 25 FQHCs lack multilingual forms despite serving populations where language access is a core mission requirement.

## Teaching Hospitals: Prestige Doesn't Equal Accessibility

Sixty percent of teaching hospitals (18/30) lack fillable form fields. **Vanderbilt University Medical Center** scores a respectable B (4.0) but publishes only image-only scans of its PDF forms — literally photographs of paper. **UPMC Presbyterian** has a born-digital PDF with 22 embedded fonts but exactly 1 interactive field. **OSU Wexner Medical Center** authored its form in Adobe Acrobat Pro yet added zero fillable fields. These institutions have sophisticated IT departments and substantial resources; the gap between capability and execution suggests records access is simply not prioritized.

## The Notarization Belt

Twenty-eight organizations require notarization or witness signatures, and the geographic pattern is striking. The requirement clusters heavily in the South and Appalachian states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Seven of 29 critical access hospitals (24%) impose this burden — a remarkable rate for small rural facilities whose patients may have limited access to notary services. **Adena Regional Medical Center** (Chillicothe, OH) requires notarization and additionally demands psychotherapist approval for patients to access their own psychotherapy notes — a likely HIPAA violation.

## Mississippi: A Case Study in Variance

Mississippi's five organizations span the full quality spectrum. **Merit Health Central** (for-profit, CHS-affiliated) scores 4.15 (B) with a dedicated patient form, while **Neshoba General** (government) and **Aaron E. Henry CHC** (nonprofit FQHC) both score 1.2 (F) with no online pathway whatsoever. **UMMC**, the state's flagship academic medical center, manages only a C (2.85). The best-performing Mississippi organization is the for-profit chain hospital — the same pattern as the national A-grade winner.

## Fees That May Violate HIPAA

Several organizations disclose fee structures that appear to exceed HIPAA's reasonable, cost-based limit for patient access. **JPS Health Network** charges a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery and $30 for the first 10 pages. **Lincoln Hospital** (Davenport, WA) cites a state fee schedule of $26 base plus $1.17/page. **UF Health Shands** charges $1.00/page uniformly without distinguishing patient access from third-party requests. None of these organizations separate patient-access fees from third-party release fees, potentially violating HHS enforcement guidance.

## Physician Gatekeeping of Patient Records

At **Mercy General Hospital** (Sacramento, CA), patients need physician approval to access their own HIV test results and caregiver approval for psychiatric records. **Providence St. Vincent** (Portland, OR) includes a physician approval/denial gate in its internal workflow. These requirements appear to contravene HIPAA § 164.524, which provides patients a largely unconditional right of access to their designated record set.
