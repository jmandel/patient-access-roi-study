# Montefiore Nyack Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Montefiore Nyack Hospital (part of Montefiore Health System) publishes a single "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available in two versions. The current version (form-1.pdf, Rev. 01/2022) is a 3-page fillable PDF linked from the hospital's [Medical Records page](https://www.montefiorenyack.org/manage-my-care/medical-records). An older version (form-2.pdf, Rev. 10/2021) remains accessible at its original URL but is no longer linked from the website. Both forms are facility-branded rather than system-wide Montefiore Health System forms.

The hospital provides three submission channels: fax (845-348-8433), email (ROI@montefiorenyack.org), and phone (845-348-2527), with a physical mailing address also listed. Electronic delivery of records via email is explicitly offered — a notable positive.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Montefiore Nyack does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA release serving patients, attorneys, and "other individuals/companies" as parallel options under a single "RELEASE THE REQUESTED RECORDS TO" section. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or any framing that acknowledges patients have a legal right to their records. The transaction is characterized entirely as an "authorization to release" — a third-party authorization framework applied to patient self-access. A patient can select "PATIENT" as the recipient, but must navigate a form that equally serves attorneys and other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL, and the form is one click from the Medical Records page. The only friction was technical: the site's CDN/WAF blocks automated downloads (curl requests return "Access Denied"), requiring browser-based retrieval. This bot-blocking is likely unintentional but could affect patients using download managers or assistive tools.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is a meaningful improvement over its predecessor. It includes 39 interactive fillable fields, allowing patients to complete it digitally rather than printing and handwriting. The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient designation → record type selection → sensitive information consent → legal disclosures → signature → contact information. Section headers are bold and labeled, and record type checkboxes (ER, inpatient, outpatient, images, billing) offer useful granularity.

However, several quality issues undercut the form. All 39 fillable fields lack accessible names, creating a significant screen-reader accessibility gap. The form has inflated to 3 pages and 353 KB (with 210 embedded images) compared to the older single-page version covering identical content in 70 KB. The revocation paragraph contains a grammatical error ("affect" instead of "effect") and switches between first and second person mid-sentence, suggesting poorly merged source text. Despite a header instructing patients to "SPECIFY THE DATES OF SERVICE," no field exists for entering dates. The distinction between an "abstract" and a full medical record is mentioned but no mechanism is provided to request the full record.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unreasonable barriers: no notarization, no witness signature, no in-person submission requirement. Fees are not mentioned at all — neither disclosed nor waived. Revocation rights and re-disclosure warnings are clearly stated. Sensitive information categories (alcohol/drug, mental health, HIV) are appropriately separated per New York State law. The electronic delivery option requires a somewhat confusing two-step process (provide email on the form and send a confirmation email to ROI@montefiorenyack.org), adding unnecessary friction.

## Overall Assessment

Montefiore Nyack Hospital provides a functional, findable, and reasonably well-designed records request process. The fillable PDF, multiple submission channels, and electronic delivery option are genuine strengths that place it above many peers. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — funneling self-access requests through a generic third-party authorization form — is the most significant gap. The form's technical quality is further diminished by unnamed fillable fields, grammatical errors, and confusing instructions around dates of service and electronic delivery. The hospital earns a solid **B grade**: accessible and usable, but not designed around the patient self-access use case.

# Prevea Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Prevea Health is an independent nonprofit physician practice based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It offers a single authorization form — an "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (PRV_839, rev. 0118) — as its primary mechanism for patients to request their own medical records. The same form is available in four languages: English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. No separate patient access–specific form or online portal was identified.

## Access Pathway

Prevea Health uses a **generic HIPAA authorization form** rather than a dedicated patient access form. However, the form explicitly accommodates patient self-requests: Section 3 ("To Disclose To") includes a "Self" checkbox with delivery options (pick up, mail, on-site viewing, electronic format, and email with encrypted/unencrypted options). Section 7 ("Purpose") includes "Patient Request" as a named checkbox option. While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, the form clearly signals that patients can use it for their own records — placing it above average among generic authorization forms.

The form does not differentiate the legal basis for patient self-access (HIPAA § 164.524) from third-party release (§ 164.508), but the practical workflow is reasonably clear for a patient who wants their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and the form is directly linked from the Patient Forms and Documents > Medical Records page at prevea.com. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was encountered. The URL is descriptive. This is a model for how organizations should make forms accessible.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally-created PDF** — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. A patient must print and hand-fill the form (or annotate it in a PDF viewer). This is the form's most significant technical limitation. The layout is logically organized into nine numbered sections with clear headings, and the single-page format keeps things concise. However, the density required to fit everything onto one page makes the rights section (Section 8) extremely cramped and difficult to read.

Section 8 is the form's weakest content area: a ~200-word paragraph of dense legalese with complex nested clauses that would challenge most patients. The rest of the form uses reasonably plain language with clearly labeled fields and checkbox options.

The form provides granular record-type selection (12 categories plus a free-text field) and includes opt-out checkboxes for sensitive information (alcohol/drug abuse, HIV results, mental health) consistent with Wisconsin law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Barriers

- **No notarization required.** Witness signature is needed only for AODA/Mental Health disclosures, consistent with legal requirements.
- **Fees:** The form states "copy fees may apply" but does not disclose specific amounts — neutral but not fully transparent.
- **Date range default:** If left blank, only records from the past two years are disclosed. This restrictive default is a notable red flag — patients seeking complete records must affirmatively specify a date range, which is unintuitive.
- **Submission instructions absent:** The form provides no guidance on where or how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, mailing address, or email for the HIM department. A patient who downloads and completes the form has no clear next step.
- **Minor errors:** "42 CRF" (should be CFR) and "e-email" (doubled prefix) suggest limited quality review.
- **HSHS references:** The form references "HSHS" (Hospital Sisters Health System) without explanation, which may confuse patients who know only Prevea Health.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — rare among physician practices and reflective of local demographics.
- **Five delivery options** including electronic format and email with encrypted/unencrypted distinction — well above average.
- **Explicit self-request pathway** via the "Self" checkbox and "Patient Request" purpose option.

## Overall Assessment

Prevea Health provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience with genuine accessibility strengths (multilingual forms, electronic delivery options, easy findability). The primary weaknesses are the non-fillable PDF format, missing submission instructions, a restrictive date range default, and dense legalese in the rights section. The form serves patients adequately but falls short of best-in-class due to its paper-oriented workflow and the absence of submission guidance.

# Decatur County Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Decatur County Hospital (Leon, IA) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in rural Iowa. The facility offers a single authorization form — "Authorization for Access, Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (DCH-#0001) — for all medical records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway; the same generic HIPAA authorization form serves both patients requesting their own records and third-party release scenarios.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form's opening language reads: "I, the undersigned authorize and request Decatur County Hospital to: Allow access, use or disclosure of my protected health information to: OR obtain from:" — presenting patient access and third-party release as two branches of the same document. A patient simply wanting to view or obtain copies of their own records must navigate fields designed for third-party recipients (recipient organization, address, fax number) that are irrelevant to their situation. The form includes a "Personal" purpose checkbox, which is the closest it comes to acknowledging individual access rights, but there is no explicit reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524. No patient portal-based records request workflow or online submission mechanism was identified.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. While initial broad web searches failed, a site-scoped search quickly located the PDF linked from the hospital's Patient Portal page. The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0001-Auth-for-Access-Use-or-Disclosure-of-PHI.pdf`) is descriptive, and no bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. For a small rural hospital, the form's online availability is commendable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a genuine bright spot in terms of technical design. Created with Acrobat PDFMaker for Word, it is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 61 AcroForm interactive fields — covering patient demographics, record type checkboxes, purpose options, sensitive-records initials, fee agreement, and signatures. Nearly every blank on the form can be completed electronically without printing. However, AcroForm field names are empty, which would hinder screen reader accessibility.

The form fits everything onto a single page — admirably compact but visually dense. The logical flow is sound (patient identity → recipient → dates → record types → purpose → sensitive records → fees → legal text → signature), but cramming 61 fields, 13 record-type checkboxes, and multiple legal paragraphs onto one page likely challenges readability. The first half uses straightforward language, while the second half descends into dense regulatory prose, particularly the re-disclosure paragraph citing 42 CFR Part 2 and Iowa Code chapters 228 and 141.

Record-type granularity is a strength: patients can select from 13 specific categories (Discharge Summary, H&P, Consultation, Radiology, Progress Notes, OR Report, Pathology, Labs, ER Notes, EKG, PT/OT/ST, Photographs) plus "Other" and a "Review only" option. This gives patients meaningful control over scope.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Social Security Number**: The form requests SSN — unnecessary for patient identification under HIPAA and a significant identity-theft risk on a form that may be faxed or mailed. A medical record number (included as "for office use only") is sufficient.

**Blank fee amount**: The fee disclosure states the hospital "may impose a fee of [blank]" and asks patients to agree to unspecified costs. This prevents patients from making informed decisions about fees before submitting their request.

**No delivery format options**: The form lacks any field for patients to specify how they want to receive records (mail, electronic, in-person). HIPAA § 164.524(c)(2)(i) requires entities to provide records in the form and format requested if readily producible.

**Outdated**: Last reviewed March 2018 — nearly eight years old, predating the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (effective 2021).

**Binding language**: The statement that authorization provisions "take precedence over statements made in the Decatur County Hospital's Notice of Privacy Practices" is potentially misleading, suggesting patients might be waiving protections.

## Strengths

The form includes an explicit conditioning prohibition (treatment will not be conditioned on signing), clear revocation instructions with a mailing address, and appropriate separate-initials requirements for sensitive records (substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS) under applicable federal and state law. The comprehensive record-type granularity and digital-first fillable design are notable positives.

## Overall Assessment

Decatur County Hospital provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient records access. The fillable PDF is technically sound, but the generic authorization approach, SSN collection, blank fee amount, outdated review date, and absence of delivery format options collectively place this facility below the standard patients should expect for exercising their individual access rights.

# Guthrie Corning Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Guthrie Corning Hospital is a community hospital in Corning, NY, operating within the Guthrie Clinic regional health system. All medical records forms are published at the system level by Guthrie Clinic and apply uniformly across its facilities (Corning, Troy, Cortland, Robert Packer, and Towanda Campus). Three documents were found: a general-purpose ROI authorization form (form-1), a family/friends access authorization (form-2), and a companion instruction sheet with fees and contact information (form-3).

## Best Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1**, the "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form — it serves all release purposes (provider-to-provider, legal, insurance, personal use) rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient must select "Personal Use" from a list of purpose options alongside "Legal," "Insurance," and "Lay Caregiver." The form does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508. Form-2 (family access) is irrelevant for patient self-access. Form-3 (instructions) supplements form-1 with submission details and fees.

The instruction sheet mentions that "Continuation of care requests may also be completed thru your individual eGuthrie/MyChart account," hinting at a patient portal pathway, but no detail is provided and this does not appear to cover general patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were **easy to find**. A basic web search immediately returned the PDF, and the Guthrie website's medical records page (guthrie.org/medical-records) serves as a well-organized hub. No bot blocking, JavaScript barriers, or login was required. All three documents were directly downloadable.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF**. It has zero interactive fields — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. Despite being digitally authored (not a scan), it was designed as a print-and-fill document with blank lines and empty checkbox squares rather than interactive elements. The form uses 9 fonts and has a dense layout that packs patient demographics, facility selection, record type checkboxes, format options, recipient information, purpose, rights statements, sensitive information opt-outs, and signature into one page. This compression keeps the form brief but makes it visually crowded.

The form's organization is logical: numbered sections flow from facility selection through record types, format, recipient, purpose, rights, expiration, and sensitive information. Language is moderately legalistic — phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" use distancing third-person framing. The instruction to "Read Entire Document Before Signing" is helpful but insufficient as the only guidance on the form itself.

Notable content features include three format options (Paper Copy, Electronic CD/DVD, Electronic On-Line) and granular record type selection (discharge summary, H&P, operative report, radiology by modality, etc.), giving patients meaningful control.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees** are transparent: the companion instruction sheet states a $6.50 flat rate for personal-use electronic records (HIPAA-compliant) and explicitly notes no charge for provider-to-provider transfers. This fee transparency, while not on the form itself, is better than most organizations.

**Submission** is available by mail, fax, or in-person — fax provides an adequate electronic submission channel. No online or email submission is available.

**No notarization** is required. The form does request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary and may deter privacy-conscious patients. The sensitive information default is opt-out (drug/alcohol, HIV, mental health records are released unless the patient checks boxes to exclude them), which is less protective than an opt-in approach. Genetic information is mentioned with no opt-out at all.

Corning Hospital patients face a geographic nuance: the instruction sheet notes "No onsite support" for Corning, directing patients to contact Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA, and mail forms to that address. This could be disorienting for local patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Excellent findability with a well-organized central medical records page
- Single-page form keeps burden low
- Clear fee transparency with HIPAA-compliant pricing
- Granular record type and format selection including electronic options
- System-wide forms eliminate confusion across facilities

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable/interactive fields despite being a digitally-created PDF
- Generic authorization form with no dedicated patient access pathway
- No reference to patient's right of access under HIPAA
- Sensitive information defaults to release (opt-out rather than opt-in)
- Critical information (fees, submission addresses, fax numbers) split across a separate document
- No onsite medical records support at Corning Hospital itself

## Overall Assessment

Guthrie Corning Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find, the fee structure is transparent and compliant, and the single-page format keeps patient burden manageable. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization approach that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, and the reliance on a print-handwrite-fax workflow place it squarely in the middle tier of organizations studied. The process works, but it was not designed with the patient as the primary user.

# University of Texas Medical Branch — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

UTMB provides three downloaded documents, but the most important distinction is between two form types: **Form 7033** ("Patients Request for Medical Records," form-1.pdf, dated April 2023) is a dedicated patient self-request form, while **Form 7032** (form-2.pdf, revised May 2024) is a general HIPAA authorization for third-party release. A third document (form-3.pdf) is an outdated 2016 version of Form 7032 hosted by Champion Records Service, a third-party ROI vendor. For a patient requesting their own records, **Form 7033 is the relevant document**.

UTMB also offers an online portal through Datavant/Swellbox as a digital alternative to the paper forms, and the medical records page references this option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UTMB earns genuine credit for maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access versus third-party release** — a design choice that relatively few organizations make. Form 7033 omits irrelevant fields (purpose of request, representative documentation requirements) and adds patient-relevant features (MyChart delivery, email delivery, email encryption disclosure). Form 7032, by contrast, has only a "Signature of Authorized Personal Representative" line with no patient signature option, and requires documentation of authority to act on the patient's behalf. This structural separation demonstrates intentional consideration of the patient self-request use case.

However, the forms do not cross-reference each other. A patient who finds Form 7032 (whether on UTMB's site or the third-party copy) has no indication that the more appropriate Form 7033 exists.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy to moderate**. A single web search surfaced UTMB's medical records page at `utmb.edu/utmbhealth/online-services/medical-records`, which lists forms with download links under a logical "Online Services > Request Medical Records" navigation path. The complication is that PDFs are hosted on SharePoint (`liveutmb.sharepoint.com`), which requires browser-based download — programmatic access (curl) returns login pages. For a typical patient using a web browser, this is a non-issue.

## Form Document Quality

Form 7033 is a **single-page, text-based PDF** with a clean text layer (no OCR artifacts, not an image scan). It flows logically: patient identification → recipient/delivery method → record scope → expiration → signature → submission instructions. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all fields must be completed by hand after printing or via PDF annotation tools. This is the primary technical shortcoming.

The form offers **four delivery options** for records: mail, fax, email, and MyChart Patient Portal. It also provides **three submission methods** for the form itself: mail, fax, and email (himrio@utmb.edu). The email submission option is a notable convenience that eliminates the need for a printer or fax machine.

Language is generally clear and functional, though institutional rather than warm. The email encryption risk disclosure is a model of transparent, plain-language communication. The form asks for approximately 10–12 fields (name, address, DOB, phone, recipient info, record scope, dates, signature).

## Barriers and Gaps

- **No fillable fields**: Despite digital distribution, the form cannot be completed electronically in standard PDF readers.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form says nothing about costs. HIPAA limits patient access fees to a reasonable, cost-based amount, but patients have no idea what to expect.
- **No turnaround time stated**: No response timeline is communicated.
- **No patient rights statement**: The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access or explain patient rights.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records are authorized in a single blanket statement with no opt-out mechanism for individual categories.
- **No multilingual support**: Notable for a Galveston, TX institution serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — email, fax, and mail are all available.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-request form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **MyChart portal delivery option** on the authorization form itself — few organizations integrate portal delivery directly into their ROI form.
- **Email submission** of the completed form at himrio@utmb.edu — lowers the barrier significantly.
- **Transparent email encryption disclosure** — clearly written, appropriately informative without being alarming.
- **Datavant/Swellbox online portal** as a digital alternative pathway.

## Overall Assessment

UTMB demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its structural decision to maintain separate patient and third-party forms, and through the variety of delivery and submission options. The organization clearly thought about the patient self-access use case. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (undermining the digital workflow), absence of fee/rights/turnaround information, and no multilingual support. The availability of email submission and an online portal partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF. Overall, UTMB earns a **B grade** — meaningfully better than average, with room for improvement in document interactivity and patient education.

# Barnes-Jewish Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJC HealthCare system) provides two distinct PDF forms on its Medical Records Requests page. **Form-1** is a dedicated patient access form titled "REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION BY INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS," designed exclusively for patients requesting their own records. **Form-2** is a general "Authorization For Release Of Information" form for third-party disclosures — attorneys, insurers, other providers. The website clearly separates these use cases, also listing links for next-of-kin requests, amendment requests, and Care Everywhere revocation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

This is where Barnes-Jewish stands out. Having a **dedicated patient self-access form** distinct from the third-party authorization is a genuine best practice that few organizations implement. The website's Medical Records Requests page explicitly categorizes "Individual requests" separately from "Third-party requests," so a patient arriving at the page sees an unambiguous path to the right form. The patient access form (revised 05/2022) uses right-of-access framing rather than authorization language — the patient is "requesting access" to their PHI, not "authorizing release." This is the correct legal framing under HIPAA § 164.524 and avoids confusing patients with irrelevant third-party authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The official website has a well-organized page at `/Patients-Visitors/Medical-Records-Requests` with direct PDF download links — no login, portal, or intermediary steps required. Standard web searches surfaced the page quickly. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. One potential source of confusion: the page notes that Washington University maintains separate medical records for WashU Clinic patients, which could leave some patients unsure whether they're requesting from the right entity.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page PDF — admirably concise. It follows a logical flow: patient identification → record type selection (20 checkboxes) → date range → delivery preferences → signature → processing information. The "Abstract (includes all * documents)" checkbox is a clever shortcut — patients who want a comprehensive record can check one box instead of thirteen individual starred items. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery via email, a forward-thinking feature for a 2022 revision.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally authored (not a scan). Patients must print and fill by hand, then submit via fax (314-747-7211) or mail. This is the primary weakness: a form revised in 2022 should have interactive PDF fields as a basic digital accessibility expectation. The form does have a clean text layer, so annotation tools could work as a workaround, but it was not designed for that workflow.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes minimal barriers. No notarization or witness is required — just a patient signature and date. Fees are described in HIPAA-compliant language ("based on the cost of the labor and supplies"), though no specific fee schedule or estimate is provided. The 30-day response time is clearly stated, matching the HIPAA-mandated timeline, with a note about possible extensions.

The main red flag is the **Social Security Number request**. While the form offers "or last 4 digits" as an alternative, placing the full SSN as the primary ask collects more sensitive PII than necessary — a medical record number or date of birth should suffice. This is an unnecessary privacy risk in a patient access context.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party release — a best practice
- **Single-page design** that accomplishes a complete request without overwhelming the patient
- **Electronic delivery option** via email, with a dedicated field
- **"Abstract" checkbox** that bundles comprehensive records into one selection
- **Clear, plain-language** processing instructions with 30-day timeline

## Overall Assessment

Barnes-Jewish Hospital demonstrates strong patient-centeredness in its records request process. The decision to create a dedicated patient access form — shorter, simpler, and legally distinct from the third-party authorization — reflects genuine attention to the patient experience. The website organization is exemplary. The primary gap is the lack of fillable PDF fields, which forces a print-and-handwrite workflow despite the form being digitally authored. With interactive fields added, this would be a near-ideal patient access pathway. As it stands, the experience is good but not fully digital-first.

# Millinocket Regional Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Millinocket Regional Hospital provides a single downloadable PDF form: an **"Authorization to Release Health Care Information"** document hosted on its website since at least 2014. This is the only records-related form found for the organization. There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The sole pathway for a patient requesting records is to download this two-page PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — most likely via fax to the number listed in the form header ((207) 723-3019).

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

The form does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. It is structured entirely around a third-party disclosure model: the patient authorizes "Name of Institution" to disclose records to another "Name of Institution or Person." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. The "reason for release" field offers only "continuing care" or "other (please specify)" — there is no option for "personal records request" or "individual access under HIPAA." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form repurposed for all release scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required persistence. Two generic web searches returned no results; only a site-scoped query (`site:mrhme.org`) succeeded. The form does not appear to be prominently linked from a patient resources or medical records page. The URL path (`/2014/06/`) suggests the document has not been updated in over a decade. Once located, the download was straightforward — no bot blocking or browser fallback needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat PDF with zero fillable fields**. All data entry uses underscore blanks designed for handwriting. The document has a text layer (not a scan) and uses four fonts, but it is fundamentally a print-and-fill artifact. The layout lacks section headers, visual hierarchy, or any design elements beyond bold title text. Record types are presented as an 18-item list (a–r) using an unusual **opt-out approach**: items are released unless crossed out, which uses double-negative logic that could easily confuse patients.

The form covers patient identification, sender/recipient institution, record type selection, reason for release, sensitive information consent (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric), and signature lines — approximately 25 fields across two pages. The language is mostly plain but includes alarming legalese: *"refusal or revocation of permission may result in improper diagnosis or treatment, denial of health benefits or insurance, or other adverse consequences"* — a warning that applies to third-party release scenarios but could discourage a patient exercising their right of access.

## Barriers & Red Flags

The form mandates: *"All spaces on this form MUST be completed for this release to be valid."* This blanket requirement goes beyond HIPAA's authorization elements and could be used to reject forms with trivially missing information. A **witness signature line** is included; combined with the all-fields-mandatory language, this effectively requires a witness — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, no response time is stated, and no delivery format options are offered.

## Bright Spots

The **18-category record-type checklist** provides meaningful granularity, including unusual categories like "Patient Additions" and "Responses to Patients Additions." The **sensitive information consent sections** correctly reference redisclosure restrictions for substance abuse records under 42 CFR Part 2. The form does include a brief patient rights statement acknowledging the right to review records and revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Millinocket Regional Hospital's records request process reflects a facility that has not modernized its patient access pathway. A single generic third-party release form — non-fillable, hard to find, and over a decade old — serves as the only documented mechanism. The form was not designed for patient self-access and contains unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, all-fields-mandatory mandate). While fax submission is available and the form provides good record-type granularity, the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.

# Proliance Surgeons — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Proliance Surgeons is a large, independent, for-profit physician practice group based in Seattle, WA, comprising multiple member practices (ProOrtho, Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, Northwest Physicians Specialists/MRI, Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons, and others). Four documents were retrieved: two nearly identical outgoing ROI authorization forms (form-2 from the main site, form-4 from ProOrtho), an image-only scan of a similar form (form-1 from NPS/MRI), and an incoming records transfer form (form-3 from Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons). The main medical records page also references Datavant as an online ROI partner, though the portal was not evaluated directly.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Proliance Surgeons does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. All outgoing ROI forms (form-1, form-2, form-4) use the same generic HIPAA authorization template ("Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information"), which is designed for third-party disclosure under § 164.508. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address as the "recipient" — an awkward workflow that conflates patient access rights (§ 164.524) with third-party authorization. The form does include an "at my request" reason checkbox, but the structure assumes disclosure to an external party. There is no mention of HIPAA Right of Access, no format/delivery preference field, and no reference to timelines or fee limitations specific to individual access.

The mention of Datavant on the medical records page suggests an online portal option exists, which would provide a more streamlined pathway, but the PDF forms themselves are the only downloadable option found.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A basic web search immediately surfaced multiple PDFs, and the main Proliance medical records page (proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links directly to the primary form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The main challenge is fragmentation: different member practices host their own versions of the same template, and a patient arriving at a subsidiary site (npsmri.com, proortho.com) may find a different version than the canonical one on the main site, with no cross-referencing between versions.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf** (ProOrtho), which is textually identical to form-2 but was noted to have interactive checkboxes (though metadata reports 0 AcroForm fields, suggesting non-standard implementation). Both are single-page, cleanly structured documents with two clear sections: "I. My Authorization" and "II. My Rights." The language is relatively plain, written in first person ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), and the layout is logical. Scope options are well-granulated (all records, condition-specific, date-specific, plus sensitive categories requiring explicit opt-in per Washington State law). However, neither form has true fillable text fields — patients must print and handwrite all entries. Form-2 includes a practice-specific fax number (425.820.8975) for submission; form-4 lacks any submission instructions entirely.

Form-1 is an image-only scan at 150 DPI with no text layer — completely inaccessible to screen readers and unsearchable. It represents the worst-case scenario a patient might encounter if they land on the NPS/MRI subsidiary site.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness requirement** — a positive.
- **No fees disclosed** — neutral; avoids deterrence but leaves patients uninformed.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax submission is available via form-2.
- **No electronic signature option** — requires printing and wet signature.
- **No response time stated** — patients have no expectation for turnaround.
- **Practice-specific contact info** baked into one form variant, creating confusion for patients at other Proliance locations.

## Notable Strengths

- **Concise one-page format** that covers all essential authorization elements without clutter.
- **Sensitive information categories** properly separated with individual opt-in checkboxes (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), compliant with Washington State RCW 70.02.
- **First-person rights language** in the "My Rights" section, which is more patient-friendly than typical third-person legal boilerplate.
- **Clear revocation instructions** with two specific methods (revocation form or letter).
- **Datavant portal mentioned** on the medical records page as an online alternative.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **Generic authorization form conflated with patient access** — no dedicated Right of Access pathway.
- **No fillable text fields** — print-and-handwrite workflow despite being a digitally-created document.
- **Fragmentation across subsidiaries** — multiple versions with inconsistent quality and no cross-referencing.
- **Form-1 is an image-only scan** — a digital accessibility failure.
- **Form-3 cites wrong state law** (California CMIA instead of Washington RCW 70.02) and wrong HIPAA year (2003 vs. 1996).

## Overall Assessment

Proliance Surgeons provides a readily findable, concise authorization form with reasonable content design and no major procedural barriers. However, the organization falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all record requests through a generic third-party authorization form with no differentiation for individual access. The print-and-handwrite workflow and subsidiary fragmentation further diminish the experience. The mention of Datavant as an online option is promising but not reflected in the downloadable forms themselves. Overall grade: **C** — adequate but not designed around patient self-access.

# St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Phoenix, AZ, offers a notably differentiated approach to medical records access. The organization maintains separate forms for patient self-access (form-2.pdf) and third-party release (form-3.pdf), with its medical records webpage clearly distinguishing between the two pathways. This separation is a meaningful patient-centeredness achievement that many organizations fail to provide.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" (X-MR-4869, dated 02/22) — a 5-page dedicated patient access form linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" option. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
- **form-3.pdf**: A 2-page third-party authorization form (X-MR-4862, dated 03/13) — an image-only scan used for releasing records to physicians or other parties.
- **form-1.pdf**: A general Arizona Dignity Health authorization form found via web search but not linked from the St. Joseph's page. It references Mercy Gilbert Medical Center and appears to be from a different facility.

The medical records page also references an online Patient Center/Patient Portal as an alternative access channel (Section D of form-2).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating approximately 4–5 clicks through the Dignity Health website (Home → Arizona → St. Joseph's → Patients and Visitors → For Patients → Medical Records). The path is logical and well-structured, though it requires traversing the multi-facility health system hierarchy. The medical records page clearly separates patient self-request from third-party authorization — a helpful distinction that reduces confusion at the point of access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

St. Joseph's stands out for maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** that is clearly distinct from its third-party release authorization. Form-2 is explicitly titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and covers only patient self-access, while form-3 handles third-party disclosures. This organizational separation reflects genuine awareness of the difference between HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) and authorization for disclosure (§ 164.508).

However, the execution has some issues. The form's processing language states the hospital will "contact you with either denial or acceptance of the request" — framing patient access as discretionary rather than as a right that must be fulfilled within 30 days. Additionally, the employee verification block on page 4 (fields for "ID Presented" and staff verification) implies in-person presentation may be expected, even though email and fax submission are explicitly offered.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is digitally typeset with a clean text layer but contains **zero fillable form fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The form is organized into five lettered sections (A through E) with a logical progression: access type → delivery format → record types → patient portal → directing records to others. This structure is clear and well-conceived.

The form offers unusually comprehensive delivery options: USB drive, CD, secure email, unsecured email, and paper. Submission can be done via email (DignityHealth-AZ-ROI@DignityHealth.org) or fax (two numbers provided), eliminating the need for physical visits. Record type granularity is excellent, with 14+ specific categories plus a "Complete Health Record" option.

The main content design weaknesses are the routing complexity on page 1 — six different email addresses and three fax numbers for different departments, requiring patients to determine which contact handles their request — and the multi-state sensitive records sections (Arizona, California, and Nevada), which add confusion for patients at an Arizona facility. At 5 pages (4 patient-facing plus a facility-only denial page), the form is moderately long but justified by the breadth of options.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. Submission is available via email and fax, so no in-person visit is necessary. Fees are mentioned ("Fees may apply. See attached price list") but the referenced price list is not included in the PDF, leaving patients unable to assess costs upfront. No specific response time or turnaround commitment is stated. A Spanish version of the form is available, which is a positive accessibility feature for the Phoenix market.

## Overall Assessment

St. Joseph's earns credit for the structural decision to maintain a dedicated patient access form — a practice that most organizations do not follow. The form offers genuine patient choice in record types and delivery formats. However, the lack of fillable fields, complex routing instructions, discretionary "acceptance" language, and missing fee schedule prevent the experience from reaching its potential. The result is an organization that has the right framework but falls short in execution, landing at a **C grade (3.40)** that reflects adequate but improvable service to patients requesting their own records.

# Advocare, LLC — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Advocare, LLC provides three downloaded authorization forms and an online submission alternative:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): The current English-language "Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information," a 2-page fillable PDF with 41 interactive fields, revised January 2026. Linked directly from the official medical records page.
- **form-3.pdf**: A Spanish-language translation of the same authorization form, dated January 2024, with 44 fillable fields. Also linked from the medical records page.
- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An older single-page version (v2, April 2021) found on a different CDN path, likely from an individual practice sub-site. It has zero fillable fields and includes a Social Security Number field that the current version removed.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, Advocare's medical records page offers an **online request option via ShareCare** and a separate third-party requester portal. The PDF forms list mail and email as delivery options, and fax is implicitly available through their practice offices.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocare does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release. All three PDF forms are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for disclosure to third parties. However, form-2 includes a **"Patient Request" checkbox** under the purpose field, acknowledging patient-initiated requests. The structural awkwardness remains: a patient requesting their own records must still fill out "recipient" fields, essentially listing themselves as the party receiving disclosure. This is a common industry pattern but reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-access-first design.

The ShareCare online portal provides an alternative pathway, though it was not evaluated as a downloaded form in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Advocare's forms was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page, which clearly links to downloadable PDFs in English and Spanish, the ShareCare online portal, and a third-party requester portal. No bot blocking, authentication, or browser workarounds were needed. The only minor issue is that the legacy form-1.pdf remains discoverable via web search, creating a risk that patients could find and submit an outdated document.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2.pdf is a **born-digital, fillable PDF** with 41 interactive fields — a significant improvement over the legacy form-1 (which had zero fillable fields). The layout follows a logical flow: patient demographics → sending/receiving provider → purpose → date range → record types → sensitive categories → attestation → signature. The two-column sender/recipient layout is efficient, and the form includes 12 record-type checkboxes plus an "Abstract Record" shortcut (last year of encounters and results).

The language is a mix of standard HIPAA authorization phrasing and reasonably clear instructions. While not truly plain-language, it is accessible to most adults. One notable defect: the PDF contains a duplicated/garbled heading ("Select from thethe following...") — a layout error. The fillable fields also lack accessible names, which would impact screen reader users.

The Spanish version (form-3) is a high-quality professional translation with fillable fields, though it lacks the email delivery option present in the English form — a functional parity gap.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **No in-person submission requirement** — mail, email, and online (ShareCare) are available.
- **No fees disclosed** on the form — neither good nor bad, but not transparent.
- **No SSN field** on the current form (the legacy form-1 did collect SSN — a red flag that was corrected).
- **90-day default expiration** is shorter than the industry-typical 6 months, potentially requiring re-authorization if processing is slow.
- **30-day response timeline** is clearly stated, correctly reflecting HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering a professionally translated Spanish form alongside English is uncommon and valuable, especially in a Northeast practice.
- **"Abstract Record" option**: Provides a practical shortcut for patients who want a summary without selecting individual record types.
- **Reference Guide**: Page 2 defines sensitive information categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, reproductive services) in plain language with NJ law citations.
- **Email delivery option**: Explicitly offers electronic delivery alongside mail.
- **Online submission via ShareCare**: Provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Overall Assessment

Advocare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an independent physician practice. Forms are easy to find, fillable, available in two languages, and offer electronic submission. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must navigate a general-purpose authorization form designed around third-party disclosure. The "Patient Request" checkbox partially addresses this, but the form's structure still assumes a sender-to-recipient model that doesn't map cleanly to individual access rights. This is a solid B-level performance: competent, accessible, and showing genuine attention to patient needs, with room for improvement in truly centering the patient access experience.

# UF Health Shands Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UF Health Shands Hospital, a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Gainesville, Florida, offers patients a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all record requests. Four versions of this form (form family PS46283/RI0001) were found online, but only one — form-2.pdf, revised 5/30/19 — is linked from the official medical records page. No dedicated patient self-access pathway exists; patients requesting their own records use the same authorization form designed for third-party release.

## Forms and Pathways

The primary form (form-2.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF linked from ufhealth.org/medical-records. Three additional variants persist online: form-1.pdf (a 2015 revision with more detailed identity verification and numbered sections), form-3.pdf (a 2014 legacy version with a liability waiver and HealthPort electronic delivery), and form-4.pdf (a clinic-specific variant pre-filled for the Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment). All share the same form code and general structure. The coexistence of multiple undifferentiated versions at different URLs creates a risk that patients or providers encounter outdated forms via search engines.

Submission options are mail and fax, both clearly printed on form-2. The medical records page also lists a phone number. An in-person pick-up option is noted on the form. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway per the scoring baseline.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UF Health Shands does **not** offer a differentiated patient self-access pathway. The form is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — the HIPAA authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than the Right of Access framework (§ 164.524). The sole accommodation for patients requesting their own records is a small "Check here if same as patient" checkbox in the "To" field. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, does not distinguish fee structures for patient access versus third-party release, and does not include any language framing the request as an individual access right.

That said, the form does include "Personal Use" as an explicit purpose option, and the identity verification fields in the representative section are marked "Internal use only," appropriately sparing patients from producing documentation at the time of form completion.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a cleanly designed, born-digital single-page PDF — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally composed (8 fonts, no embedded images, only 95 KB), the form requires printing and handwriting. This is a persistent gap across all four form versions, suggesting an organizational decision rather than a legacy issue.

The layout is logical: patient demographics → from/to routing → facility selection → record types → dates/purpose/format → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. Sixteen record-type checkboxes (including separated sensitive-information categories for behavioral health, substance use disorder, STD/HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing) provide excellent granularity. The legal disclosure section uses reasonably clear language with helpful parentheticals (e.g., "revoke it in writing (i.e., tell UF Health to cancel it)"), though the opening corporate entity definition paragraph is dense legalese.

Delivery format options include MyUFHealth (the patient portal), CD, and paper — the portal option is a notable modern addition, though it serves as a delivery mechanism rather than a request submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization, witness signatures, or in-person submission is required. Authorization expires after one year with clear revocation rights. However, the fee disclosure — "up to $1.00 per page (plus applicable tax and handling) for Paper Records" — is applied uniformly without distinguishing patient access from third-party release. For patient self-access under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4), HIPAA limits fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts; the $1.00/page rate (reflecting Florida's statutory schedule for third-party releases) may exceed this standard. No response time commitment is stated.

The older form-3 includes a liability waiver ("I hereby release and discharge UF Health...from any liability"), which is an additional barrier not present in the current primary form.

## Overall Assessment

UF Health Shands provides an easily findable, well-organized, and compact authorization form, but falls short in two critical areas: (1) the complete absence of fillable PDF fields forces a paper-based workflow, and (2) the generic authorization framework fails to differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The fee language, while standard for Florida third-party releases, is potentially non-compliant when applied to patient access requests. The form earns credit for its granular record-type selection, explicit "Personal Use" purpose option, MyUFHealth portal delivery, and patient-friendly touches like marking verification fields as internal-use-only — but these bright spots don't compensate for the fundamental lack of a patient-centered access pathway and the print-and-handwrite workflow.

# Canton-Potsdam Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Canton-Potsdam Hospital (CPH) is a community hospital in Potsdam, NY, operated as part of St. Lawrence Health System (SLH), which was acquired by Rochester Regional Health (RRH). Three documents were retrieved — all from the Wayback Machine, as no forms remain on any live website. The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-2.pdf, a blank New York State OCA Official Form No. 960 ("Authorization for Release of Health Information Pursuant to HIPAA"). The other two documents are a COVID-specific pre-filled version of the same form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3.pdf).

## Access Pathway

Canton-Potsdam Hospital does **not** offer a differentiated pathway for patient self-access. The only authorization form the organization ever published online was the generic NY State OCA-960, which is designed for third-party release of information — not for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. A patient requesting their own records would use the same form as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer, needing to awkwardly list themselves as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no web-based submission tool.

Critically, the parent system's Swellbox/Datavant online records request tool **explicitly excludes** St. Lawrence Health facilities, stating: "St. Lawrence Health is not currently available through this application, for information on requesting these records call (315) 769-4386." This leaves phone as the only visible pathway for patients today.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any form for this organization was extremely difficult. The original SLH website (stlawrencehealthsystem.org) now redirects to rochesterregional.org, where CPH-specific content has not been migrated. Multiple web searches returned no downloadable forms. The only successful strategy was the Wayback Machine CDX API, which identified archived PDFs from the defunct SLH domain. A typical patient would have no realistic way to find these forms.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2.pdf, blank OCA-960) is a digitally produced PDF — not a scan — but has **zero fillable fields**. Its text layer is severely garbled due to font encoding issues, rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers, search, or copy-paste. Despite being created digitally (via PScript5.dll/Acrobat Distiller), no interactive fields were added, requiring patients to print and handwrite responses.

The form is 2 pages: page 1 is the authorization itself with 13 numbered items; page 2 provides instructions. The structure is logical and reasonably organized, covering patient identification, record scope, recipients, purpose, expiration, and signature. However, the language is formal and legalistic, and the form is not pre-populated with any CPH or SLH contact information — patients must know and fill in the correct provider name and HIM department address themselves.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form includes appropriate compliance elements: explicit voluntariness statement, non-conditioning language, right to revoke in writing, and separate initialing for sensitive categories (HIV, substance abuse, mental health) per NY State law. However, the form header includes a Social Security Number field, which creates unnecessary identity theft risk and is not required by HIPAA. No fees are mentioned on the authorization form itself, though the NPP (form-3) does include HIPAA-compliant fee language limiting electronic copy costs to direct labor.

The form does not specify submission methods, delivery format options, or response timelines. No electronic delivery options are mentioned.

## Notable Strengths

- Uses the standardized NY State OCA-960, ensuring baseline legal compliance
- NPP clearly articulates electronic access rights and EHR-based record availability
- Patient-controlled authorization expiration (by date or event)
- Appropriate sensitive-information opt-in with separate initialing requirements

## Notable Weaknesses

- No ROI form available on any live website; patients must call to initiate requests
- Parent system's online records tool explicitly excludes this facility
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party authorization
- Form has zero fillable fields and a garbled, inaccessible text layer
- SSN field on authorization form creates unnecessary risk
- Organization appears stuck in a transitional state between SLH and RRH infrastructure

## Overall Assessment

Canton-Potsdam Hospital presents one of the weakest patient access experiences in this study. The combination of unfindable forms, a phone-only current pathway, no dedicated patient access process, and technically deficient documents creates substantial barriers for patients seeking their own records. The organizational transition from St. Lawrence Health to Rochester Regional Health has left patients in a gap — excluded from the parent system's digital tools but with no local alternative. A patient today would need to call, navigate an uncertain process, and likely complete a paper form designed for third-party release rather than individual access.

# San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center — Synthesis

## Overview

San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center (SLV Health-RMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Alamosa, Colorado, part of the San Luis Valley Health regional system that also includes Conejos County Hospital (La Jara). The organization makes three PDF forms available online: a current English-language authorization form (form-1), a superseded 2013 English version (form-2, still publicly accessible but no longer linked), and a Spanish-language translation (form-3). All three are generic "Authorization to Release Medical Record Information" forms — none is designed specifically for patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Access Pathway

SLV Health does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All three forms use a "RELEASE FROM" / "RELEASE TO" structure designed for authorizing disclosure to a named recipient — an attorney, insurer, or other provider. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves in the "RELEASE TO" field, which is workable but unintuitive. There is no checkbox, pathway, or language acknowledging that a patient might simply want to access their own health information. No patient portal or online request wizard is offered for records requests.

The primary pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, then email the completed form to `MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org` or mail it to the facility. The email submission option is a meaningful convenience that prevents the need for in-person delivery.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **very easy**. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the organization's Medical Records page (`/patient-center/medical-records/`) clearly links to both the English and Spanish authorization forms. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only concern is that the older form-2 remains publicly accessible at its original URL and could surface in search results, potentially confusing patients about which version to use.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with extractable text — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are visual underlines meant for handwriting, and there is a "Patient Sticker" area intended for in-facility paper workflows. The form cannot be completed electronically within the PDF itself. This is clearly a print-oriented document.

The layout is dense but logically organized, flowing from facility identification through patient info, record type selection (six categories with initial-based checkboxes), expiration options, sensitive-condition authorization, and signature block. The language is moderately legalistic but generally understandable — the authorization statement is reasonably clear. Section headers provide hierarchy, though the initial-based checkbox convention `( )` requires familiarity.

The form lacks instructions or guidance text, offers no statement of patient rights, and makes no reference to HIPAA, turnaround times, or fees.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests Social Security Numbers as a standard identification field alongside name and date of birth — unnecessary for a records release authorization and creating identity theft risk. This is particularly concerning given the community's demographics.

The vague disclaimer **"San Luis Valley Health is not responsible if lost"** is poorly worded and could deter patients from submitting forms remotely. The **copies clause** (MAY/MAY NOT be used with same effectiveness as original) places an opaque legal decision on patients. A persistent **spelling error** ("INFORMATION REQUIRIED") has survived at least two revision cycles, suggesting limited quality control.

No notarization is required. No in-person submission is required. No fees are disclosed — neither their presence nor absence is mentioned.

## Bright Spots

The **Spanish-language form** is a genuine strength. It is co-located with the English version on the Medical Records page, requiring no extra navigation — appropriate and commendable for a community hospital serving the San Luis Valley's significant Latino population. The **email submission option** lowers the barrier compared to fax-only or mail-only processes. The **single-page design** is efficient, and the **granular record-type options** give patients meaningful control over scope.

## Overall Assessment

SLV Health-RMC earns credit for easy findability, bilingual support, and email submission — things many organizations fail to provide. However, the lack of a patient-specific access pathway, absence of fillable fields, SSN collection, and missing rights information keep this solidly in the middle tier. A patient can navigate the process, but the organization hasn't designed it with patient self-access in mind. The form serves its historical purpose as a generic release authorization; it has not evolved to meet the expectations of a patient-centered digital healthcare landscape. **Grade: C.**

# AdventHealth Hendersonville — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Hendersonville is a community hospital in western North Carolina, part of the AdventHealth major nonprofit health system. The facility's primary pathway for medical records requests is a **Swellbox/Datavant online eRequest wizard**, linked from a shared system-wide medical records page. No downloadable PDF form specific to AdventHealth Hendersonville exists. The three PDF forms retrieved during the search all belong to other AdventHealth facilities — two from St. Luke's Hospital in Columbus, NC (~40 miles away) and one from Florida Hospital Heartland Division in Sebring, FL.

## Access Pathway Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville's medical records page (accessible via a footer link on the facility homepage) provides phone, fax, and online eRequest options under the "Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina Locations" tab. The **Swellbox/Datavant wizard** at `swellbox.com/adventhealth-mid-wizard.html` is the primary digital pathway for all records requests. This is an online portal approach — a fully digital request workflow that does not require printing, handwriting, or physically delivering a form.

The facility does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the form discovery level; the Swellbox wizard is the single channel for all request types. Whether the wizard itself differentiates internally is unknown from the available materials. Among the sister-facility PDF forms found, form-1 (St. Luke's "Patient Request for Access") does explicitly separate patient self-access from third-party release — but this form is not linked from AdventHealth Hendersonville's pages and belongs to a different facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms for AdventHealth Hendersonville required **moderate effort**. The medical records page was findable through standard website navigation (footer link), and the Swellbox wizard URL was clearly listed. However, multiple web searches for downloadable PDF forms returned only results from sister facilities, and URL-guessing for Hendersonville-specific PDFs returned 404 errors. The shared system-wide medical records page, with its tabbed regional structure, adds a layer of navigation complexity — a patient must identify the correct regional tab and locate their facility within it. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Since no Hendersonville-specific PDF form exists, the best available PDF for assessment is **form-1 (St. Luke's Patient Request for Access)** — a sister facility form from the same Western NC region. This is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) that must be printed and filled by hand. It has a logical top-to-bottom flow covering patient identification, scope selection, format preferences, and delivery method. The language is plain and patient-friendly ("If you would like a copy of your medical record, please complete the form below"). It offers excellent format options (CD, flash drive, email, paper) and delivery methods (mail, secure email, fax, pickup).

However, the form is dated **June 2016**, still uses pre-rebrand "St. Luke's Hospital" branding, includes the Columbus, NC address, and explicitly states "I am a patient of St. Luke's Hospital." A Hendersonville patient using this form would be submitting a request to the wrong facility.

The primary pathway — the Swellbox wizard — is likely a more functional and appropriate tool for Hendersonville patients, but as an external third-party portal, its internal quality could not be assessed from the downloaded materials.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness** required on the sister-facility forms.
- **Fees**: Not mentioned on form-1; form-2 states "A fee may be charged" without specifying amounts; form-3 mentions fees may apply. No fee schedule was found.
- **SSN collection**: Forms request last 4 digits of SSN (form-1 and form-2) or full SSN (form-3), which is unnecessary for patient access.
- **Submission methods**: The Swellbox wizard provides fully online submission. Fax (828-651-4018) and phone (828-681-2135) are also available. No indication that in-person delivery is required.

## Notable Strengths

- **Online portal pathway**: The Swellbox/Datavant wizard offers a fully digital workflow — no printing, scanning, or faxing required.
- **Multiple contact channels**: Phone, fax, and online options are all clearly listed.
- **Sister facility form quality**: Form-1, though not Hendersonville-specific, demonstrates that AdventHealth's regional forms can be well-designed with good format/delivery options.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No facility-specific PDF form**: A patient who prefers or needs a downloadable form has no Hendersonville-specific option.
- **Wrong-facility forms in search results**: PDF forms from other AdventHealth facilities appear in searches, creating confusion risk.
- **Outdated sister-facility forms**: The available PDFs are 7-10 years old with pre-rebrand branding.
- **System-wide page complexity**: The shared medical records page requires patients to navigate regional tabs to find their facility.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville provides an adequate-to-good patient records request experience through its Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, which represents a modern, portal-based approach. The facility scores well on having an electronic submission pathway and multiple contact options. However, the absence of any facility-specific downloadable form, combined with confusing sister-facility PDFs in search results and a somewhat complex system-wide navigation structure, prevents a top-tier rating. The organization's approach is portal-first by design, which works well for digitally comfortable patients but offers no paper-form fallback specific to this facility.

# Consensus Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Consensus Health operates as a decentralized network of independent physician practices in New Jersey. Four documents were retrieved, but none is a dedicated patient records request form. The most relevant document for patient self-access is **form-1.pdf**, a generic, unbranded one-page "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" hosted on PatientPop's CDN — not on any Consensus Health website. The remaining three documents are Consensus Health–branded intake paperwork from Skylands Medical Group (a member practice): a general consent/disclosure/authorization form (form-2), a HIPAA acknowledgment (form-3), and a seven-page Notice of Privacy Practices (form-4). None of these serves as a patient-initiated records request mechanism.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Consensus Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The only ROI-adjacent form (form-1) is framed entirely as a third-party disclosure authorization — its language ("authorize the disclosure of information from my health record" to a named "Person/Organization/Facility") assumes records are being sent to someone other than the patient. There is no form, process, or web page designed for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524. The organization appears to direct patients to the athenahealth patient portal or to contact the office by phone, but no documented ROI workflow exists through either channel.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any relevant form was **extremely difficult**. The main Consensus Health website has no patient forms section. Extensive searching — direct navigation, URL guessing across multiple paths, site-specific searches, and PDF filetype searches — produced nothing. The generic ROI form was only found through a general web search linking to a PatientPop-hosted PDF loosely associated with Consensus Health practices. The Consensus Health–branded documents were discovered on a member practice's WordPress site (Skylands Medical Group), not on any Consensus Health–owned domain. A patient visiting consensushealth.com would find no path to an ROI form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the best available ROI document, is a bare-bones single-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects approximately 11 fields (patient name, record number, address, DOB, free-text information requested, free-text purpose, recipient name/address/phone, and signature/date). The layout is plain and functional, and the language is reasonably clear. However, the form is critically incomplete: it provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or any indication of where to send the completed form. It carries no organizational branding, so a patient cannot confirm it belongs to their provider. A patient completing this form would have no idea what to do with it.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No submission pathway**: The form provides zero information about how to submit it — a functional barrier that effectively renders the form unusable without outside knowledge.
- **Missing HIPAA-required authorization elements**: The form lacks an expiration date, revocation language, and the name of the disclosing entity — elements required under 45 CFR § 164.508(c) for a valid authorization.
- **"Record Number" field**: The form asks for a medical record number without explaining where the patient would find this.
- **Vague fee language**: The NPP (form-4) mentions "reasonable fees" for copies but provides no specific amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.
- **"Proprietary & Confidential" marking** on the NPP — an odd designation for a document HIPAA requires to be publicly available.

## Notable Strengths

- The **Notice of Privacy Practices** (form-4) is substantive and current (Version 2.0, 2025), including reproductive health care protections reflecting the 2024 HIPAA Final Rule and explicit acknowledgment of patients' right to electronic access.
- The NPP states a **30-day response commitment** for records requests, aligning with HIPAA standards.
- The consent form (form-2) has a well-designed **authorized individuals section** with granular health/payment disclosure options and a detailed **contact preferences** section.

## Overall Assessment

Consensus Health presents a significant challenge for patients seeking their own medical records online. The organization has no centralized patient forms infrastructure, no dedicated records request form, and no documented electronic submission pathway. The only ROI-adjacent form found is an unbranded, non-fillable, third-party authorization template that lacks essential information for a patient to act on it. While the athenahealth patient portal may offer an alternative pathway, this is not documented or promoted as a records request mechanism. The decentralized practice model means patients at different member practices may have different (and equally opaque) experiences. This organization's approach to patient records access is best characterized as an afterthought — not hostile, but functionally absent from its public-facing digital presence.

# Northwest Colorado Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Northwest Colorado Health is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms on its website: one for behavioral health records (form-1) and one for medical/dental records (form-2). Both are single-page PDFs available from a dedicated patient forms page. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient-access form — both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for any release of information, whether to the patient themselves or to a third party.

## Access Pathway

Northwest Colorado Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Request Information FROM" / "Release Information TO" structure, treating a patient requesting their own records identically to someone authorizing release to an insurer, attorney, or another provider. The "Release Information TO" section does list "Self / Legal Guardian" as a pre-printed option, which at least acknowledges that patients may be the intended recipient, but the form's structure, legal language, and scope options are all oriented toward the general authorization use case.

Patients who received both medical and behavioral health services at this facility would need to complete **two separate forms** — a meaningful friction point not faced by those seeking release to a single third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped web search located the patient forms page at a logical URL path (`/what_you_can_do/patient-resources/patient-forms/english.html`). Both forms were publicly linked, downloadable without authentication, and no bot-blocking or CAPTCHA was encountered. The download URLs are GUID-based and not human-readable, but this is a minor cosmetic issue.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form for patient self-access is form-2 (Medical and/or Dental), as it covers the broadest category of records most patients would seek. Key observations:

- **Fillability:** Despite metadata reporting 43 field annotations, the form is functionally a flat PDF — not practically fillable. Patients must print and complete by hand.
- **Length:** A single page, which is commendably concise. However, this compresses a substantial amount of content into a tight layout.
- **Language:** The introductory paragraph is notably patient-friendly: "We value your privacy at Northwest Colorado Health. Legally, we cannot release your written health record to anyone (including you) without your specific consent." The tone shifts to denser legal language in the six numbered disclaimers but remains reasonably readable.
- **Layout:** Logically organized with clear sections — patient info, FROM/TO entities, record types, purpose, sensitive-information authorization, signature, and legal paragraphs. Checkbox-driven options for record types and disclosure purposes reduce writing burden.
- **Instructions:** The form provides adequate contextual guidance but lacks explicit step-by-step instructions. Critically, it provides **no submission instructions** — a patient who downloads and completes the form has no guidance on where or how to send it (no fax number, no mailing address, no email, no portal link for submission).

## Barriers and Concerns

- **SSN collection:** Both forms request the patient's Social Security Number, which is unnecessary for identity verification under HIPAA and creates a data security risk.
- **No submission method stated:** The absence of submission instructions is a significant barrier. The Privacy Officer's mailing address appears only in the revocation clause, not as a submission destination.
- **No fee disclosure:** The forms neither mention fees nor state that patient access is free, leaving cost ambiguity.
- **Legacy organization name:** The revocation section refers to "Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association," the organization's former name, which could confuse patients despite the form's 04/2020 revision date.

## Bright Spots

- **Fast processing commitment:** "Up to 48 business hours" (~6 business days) is well within HIPAA's 30-day window and more specific and faster than most organizations promise.
- **Plain-language introduction:** The opening paragraph is warm, clear, and patient-friendly — significantly better than the legalistic openings common on ROI forms.
- **Photocopy validity:** The form states that photocopies are as valid as originals, reducing barriers for patients.
- **Non-retaliation statement:** Clearly states that care and payment will not be affected by declining to sign.
- **Easy findability:** Forms are publicly accessible without login or barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Northwest Colorado Health provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find, concise, and written with an unusually patient-friendly tone. However, the organization funnels all requests through a generic authorization form with no differentiation for patient self-access, collects unnecessary SSNs, provides no submission instructions, and offers only a print-and-handwrite workflow. The split into two separate forms by record category adds friction for patients. This is a typical small independent FQHC approach — adequate but not designed with the patient's individual access rights as a first-class concern.

# TriStar Centennial Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

TriStar Centennial Medical Center is an HCA Healthcare–affiliated community hospital in Nashville, TN. Three documents were retrieved: the primary English-language HCA authorization form (form-1), a Spanish translation (form-3), and a separate form for Centennial Medical Group, an affiliated physician practice in Elkridge, MD (form-2). The hospital's own forms (form-1 and form-3) are the relevant documents for assessing this facility's patient access experience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for authorization/release form terms immediately surfaced the hospital's medical records page, which is clearly organized under For Patients → Medical Records. Both English and Spanish PDF download links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or portal login was required. The HCA Digital Asset Management URLs worked with a standard download. This is about as easy as form retrieval gets.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

TriStar Centennial does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary document (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of PHI" designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release. The "Purpose of disclosure" field lists "At the request of the individual" as the first option, with "Other 3rd party recipient" as the alternative — but both flow through the same form, same fields, and same process. Patients must navigate Section B (marketing/sale of PHI disclosures) even when it doesn't apply, and the form's recipient fields are oriented toward third-party recipients rather than a simple "send me my records" workflow.

That said, the medical records page also offers a **Swellbox online portal** for digital submission and the **MyHealthONE patient portal** for direct record access, providing alternative pathways that may offer a more patient-centric experience. The existence of these portal options partially compensates for the generic form design.

## Form Document Quality

The primary HCA form (form-1) is technically excellent. It is a **digitally native, single-page PDF with 52 fillable fields** — covering every input from patient demographics to 16+ record-type checkboxes to delivery preferences. This is unusually thorough; many organizations provide flat, non-fillable PDFs that require printing and handwriting. The file is lean (170 KB, no embedded images, 9 fonts), confirming it was designed as a digital artifact rather than scanned from paper.

The form offers **four delivery format options** — paper copy, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email — which is above average. It includes a forward-looking **USCDI Release Request** option for structured health data exchange, though this feature is aimed at provider-to-provider use and would confuse most patients.

Layout is organized into three labeled sections (A: core authorization, B: marketing/sale disclosures, C: signatures), which provides logical structure. However, packing this much content into a single page means tight spacing and modest font sizes. The language is a mix of functional form labels and legal disclosures — the patient rights statements use reasonably plain first-person language ("I understand that…"), but passages like the unencrypted email risk disclaimer are dense.

The **Spanish translation** (form-3) is a full parallel version with identical structure and 52 fillable fields — not a scan or afterthought. A few staff-facing elements (footer text, "ID verified by" field) remain in English, but the patient-facing content is fully translated.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no significant barriers**. No notarization or witness is required. The SSN field is explicitly marked optional. The 180-day default expiration is reasonable with options for custom dates. Psychotherapy notes are properly separated per HIPAA requirements. Fee language references a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts — appropriate, though it gives patients no cost visibility.

Submission options include **fax (844-481-0298) and mail**, plus the Swellbox portal for fully digital submission. A patient can complete and submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual fillable PDFs**: Both English and Spanish versions with 52 interactive fields each, directly linked from the same page
- **USCDI release option**: Rare acknowledgment of interoperability standards on an ROI form
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Four options including encrypted email
- **Portal alternatives**: Swellbox and MyHealthONE provide digital-first pathways beyond the PDF
- **10-day turnaround** (on the CMG form) and clear contact information

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: The generic authorization form doesn't distinguish individual access rights from third-party release
- **Default to paper delivery**: If the delivery section is left blank, the patient gets paper — an electronic default would be more patient-friendly
- **Dense single page**: The amount of content compressed onto one page may challenge patients with limited literacy or visual impairments
- **Minor grammatical error**: "I may see and obtain a copy the information" is missing "of"

## Overall Assessment

TriStar Centennial earns a **B grade**. The technical quality of its forms is strong — fillable fields, bilingual availability, multiple delivery options, and a clean digital PDF. Retrieval is effortless. Compliance posture is solid with no unnecessary barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway: a patient requesting their own records navigates the same authorization form as an insurer or attorney, with no differentiation in process, language, or workflow. The availability of portal alternatives (Swellbox, MyHealthONE) partially mitigates this, but the core PDF experience doesn't center the patient as an individual exercising their right of access.

# Desert Valley Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Desert Valley Hospital (DVH) is a for-profit community hospital in Victorville, CA, part of the Prime Healthcare system. A patient attempting to request their own medical records online faces significant barriers: DVH's website describes the records request process but provides no downloadable authorization form. The only usable patient-facing form was found on a sister Prime Healthcare hospital's website (Chino Valley Medical Center), using a system-wide template that DVH presumably also uses but has not published.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved during an exhaustive search:

1. **Form-2 (PHSI-280-014 CVMC)** — the most relevant document. A 2-page general HIPAA authorization form from Chino Valley Medical Center, a Prime Healthcare sister hospital. This system-wide template is the standard patient ROI form across Prime Healthcare facilities. It has 47 fillable fields, granular record-type selection, and a clear patient rights section. However, it is branded for CVMC, not DVH.

2. **Form-1 (PHSI-320-012)** — an employee-only authorization for Prime Healthcare's internal health plan. Explicitly marked "FOR PRIME EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ENROLLED DEPENDENTS USE ONLY." Not applicable to general patients.

3. **Form-3** — an employment services authorization from Desert Valley Medical Group for occupational health services (DOT physicals, drug screens). Not an ROI form.

The DVH Medical Records page (dvmc.com/patients-visitors/medical-records/) instructs patients to submit requests via mail, fax, or in person, with a $15 fee and 14-business-day turnaround. No online portal, no downloadable form, and no email submission option are offered.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

DVH does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The Prime Healthcare template (form-2) is a generic "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" designed for all release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both the authorizing entity and themselves as recipient — workable but not optimized for self-request. The form does include a "patient request" checkbox under Purpose, which at least acknowledges this use case.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was rated **Hard**. The dvmc.com website was thoroughly searched — including sitemap crawling and URL pattern probing — with no authorization form found. The Desert Valley Medical Group site yielded only the employment services form. Success required identifying the Prime Healthcare parent system and checking sister hospitals' websites. A typical patient would have no way to discover or download the form online.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form (form-2) has notable technical strengths: 47 fillable interactive fields allow on-screen completion, and the document has a full text layer. The 2-page layout follows a logical sequence — demographics, release details, record-type selection, purpose, expiration, patient rights, format options, and signature. The "MY RIGHTS" section uses clear first-person language explaining refusal rights, inspection rights, and revocation procedures. HITECH electronic format options (CD, paper, email) are explicitly cited.

However, weaknesses are present: the form requests a full Social Security Number (unnecessary and a privacy risk), the opening warns that incomplete forms "may invalidate this Authorization" (potentially coercive), a "Witness" line appears without guidance on whether it's required, the header contains a typo ("OR" instead of "OF"), and field names are not accessible (empty in metadata, potentially impacting screen readers). The 1.65 MB file size for a 2-page form reflects poor optimization.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is explicitly required. Fax submission is available (an adequate electronic pathway). The $15 fee is disclosed only on the website, not on the form itself. The SSN collection and completeness-invalidation warning are the most concerning compliance issues — SSN is not required by HIPAA for records requests, and the warning could pressure patients into providing unnecessary information. The witness line creates ambiguity that may deter patients. The "financially responsible party" listed as an authorized signer raises questions about conflating billing and health information access.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 47 interactive fields — significantly better than many flat/print-only forms
- HITECH electronic format citation with email delivery option
- Granular sensitive-information consent (seven categories requiring individual initials)
- Clear patient rights section with California-specific re-disclosure language

## Overall Assessment

Desert Valley Hospital earns a **C grade**. While the underlying Prime Healthcare form template is reasonably well-designed with fillable fields and a clear rights section, the hospital's failure to publish any patient-facing form online creates a fundamental access barrier. A patient must either contact HIM by phone to obtain the form, visit in person, or discover it on a sister hospital's website — none of which constitute an accessible online pathway. The generic authorization design, SSN collection, and coercive completeness language further reduce patient-centeredness.

# Bayshore Medical Center — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Bayshore Medical Center, part of the Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) system, routes patients through the system-wide infrastructure for medical records requests. Six documents were retrieved during the search process, but only two are directly relevant for a Bayshore patient requesting their own records: the **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary English pathway) and the **CMR-003 authorization form** (form-6, a 2-page PDF covering all 11 HMH hospitals). A Spanish companion form (CMR-003S, form-3) mirrors the English PDF. Additional documents include an older Medical Group outpatient release form (form-1, dated 2018), two forms from sister facility Pascack Valley (forms 2 and 5), and a records amendment form (form-4).

The primary pathway for English-speaking patients is the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, linked from the HMH system-wide Medical Records page under "Request Records." Spanish-speaking patients are directed to the CMR-003S PDF download. Notably, the English PDF version of CMR-003 is **not linked** from the Medical Records page — it was found only through web search under an inconsistent URL path (medical-group/patient-forms rather than patients-visitors).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Bayshore does not offer a dedicated patient self-access PDF form. The CMR-003 PDF is a generic HIPAA authorization framed around third-party disclosure: "I authorize Hackensack Meridian Health to release information to: Organization/Recipient." A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name as the "recipient" and select "Personal use" from five purpose options — an awkward workaround. The online portal (Swellbox/Datavant) likely provides a more patient-centric experience as the primary pathway, but the PDF form does not distinguish between individual access and third-party release.

Interestingly, Pascack Valley Medical Center (an HMH sister facility) offers a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-5) with patient-first language and a "Myself" default recipient option. This demonstrates that the HMH system has the concept of a dedicated patient-access form but has not standardized it across all facilities.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the relevant forms required significant effort. The search involved web searches, site-specific navigation, URL pattern guessing, and cross-facility comparison. The Bayshore Medical Center sub-page links to the HMH Medical Records page (2–3 clicks), which prominently features the Swellbox portal but buries the PDF forms. The English CMR-003 was located via web search under the Medical Group directory — a misleading location for a hospital-level form. Retrieval difficulty: **hard**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary PDF form (CMR-003, form-6) is a born-digital 2-page document with a clean text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print and hand-write all entries. This is particularly notable given that HMH's own amendment form (form-4) has 54 fillable fields — proving the organization has the capability but did not apply it to the ROI form. The layout is logically structured with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient info → recipient → location → records → purpose → sensitive-record consent → signature → delivery format. Record type granularity is good (11 categories) and delivery format options are comprehensive (paper, encrypted USB/CD, fax, secured email).

Language is a mix of plain and legal. Core instructions are clear, but the minor consent section and legal disclosures use dense, nested phrasing. The form lacks explicit submission instructions — while the contact directory on page 2 lists HIM phone and fax numbers for each campus, the form never tells patients *how* to submit the completed authorization. The fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee… Please ask."

## Barriers and Bright Spots

No notarization, in-person submission, or witness requirements exist. Fax submission is available (Bayshore HIM fax: 732-888-7332), providing an adequate electronic pathway. The vague fee disclosure and absent submission instructions are minor barriers.

The standout bright spot is the **EHI Export option** — an explicit offer to provide records in a machine-readable format uploadable to another EHR. This is exceptionally rare on ROI forms and directly supports 21st Century Cures Act interoperability goals (despite the typo "Electric" instead of "Electronic" Health Record). The Spanish companion form, comprehensive contact directory, and granular sensitive-record consent are additional strengths.

## Overall Assessment

Bayshore Medical Center, via HMH, provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox/Datavant portal offers a digital-first primary pathway, and the PDF form — while non-fillable and oriented toward third-party release — includes progressive features like EHI Export and multilingual availability. The main weaknesses are the difficult findability of the English PDF, the generic authorization framing that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, and the lack of fillable fields on a form that could easily support them. Grade: **B**.

# Columbus Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbus Community Hospital is an independent nonprofit community hospital in Columbus, Nebraska. A single ROI form was found: a one-page "Authorization to Release Medical Records" (form MR-1, dated December 2014). The hospital does not offer a patient portal-based records request, an online request wizard, or any dedicated patient self-access form. The sole pathway is this generic third-party authorization form, with email submission available via `release@columbusch.com`.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

The most significant finding is that Columbus Community Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form is structured entirely as a release authorization: "I authorize Columbus Community Hospital to release the following information on [patient] to: [Name and Address]." A patient requesting their own records must write their own name and address in the "to:" field — an unintuitive workaround with no guidance that this is a valid or expected use of the form. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that patients have a right to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The hospital operates two domains: `columbusch.com` (the primary patient-facing site) and `columbushosp.org` (a legacy domain hosting the PDF). The patient forms page on the newer site mentions the Release of Information form and provides an email address for submission, but does not include a direct download link. A web search was needed to surface the PDF URL on the legacy domain. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during download.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks are represented as printed underscores requiring handwritten completion. Despite having a text layer (not a scan), the document offers no digital interaction — patients must print, handwrite, and then scan or photograph it to submit via email.

At one page, the form is concise. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, recipient identification, treatment dates, record type checkboxes (nine options plus "Complete Record"), purpose checkboxes (six options), sensitive-information authorization, patient acknowledgments, and signature blocks. However, the single-page density leaves little whitespace, and internal filing codes appear in the footer ("Found in Policy Manager/Consent Forms," "c: HIPAA Manual," page "42") — artifacts of internal document management that were never removed for patient-facing use.

Language is generally understandable but includes unexplained jargon ("H & P") and legalistic constructions in the acknowledgment section. The form includes no instructions or guidance text explaining how to complete it.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form avoids several common barriers: no fees are mentioned, no notarization is required, and no in-person submission is mandated. The revocation rights are clearly stated, and a built-in "Notice of Revocation" section allows patients to revoke authorization without finding a separate form — a genuine bright spot. The non-retaliation statement and 12-month authorization expiration are appropriate.

However, the witness signature line is ambiguous — it is unclear whether a witness is required or optional, which could deter patients completing the form at home. The form's age (dated 2014, over 11 years old at evaluation) raises questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Built-in revocation section; granular record-type selection (nine categories); email submission channel available; concise single-page format.

**Red flags:** No patient self-access pathway; form structured exclusively for third-party release; no mention of patient rights; non-fillable PDF requiring print and handwrite; internal filing codes visible on patient-facing document; disconnected web presence with form hosted on legacy domain without links from the main site.

## Overall Assessment

Columbus Community Hospital provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly patient-centered records request process. The form works — a determined patient can download it, fill it out by hand, and email it in — but the experience reflects a pre-digital, compliance-oriented approach rather than a patient-access-oriented one. The absence of any dedicated patient self-access pathway, combined with a non-fillable form from 2014 and a fragmented web presence, places this organization below average for patient-centeredness. **Grade: C**

# EyeSouth Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a practice management organization (PMO) headquartered in Atlanta, GA, operating a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. It is a HIPAA covered entity with a designated Privacy Officer, but the corporate website is entirely partnership-focused with no patient-facing content. Two ROI forms were retrieved — neither from EyeSouth Partners itself, but from individual affiliates: Center for Sight (Florida) and Georgia Retina (Georgia).

## Available Pathways

A patient seeking records from an EyeSouth Partners affiliate faces a fragmented landscape. The parent organization offers no downloadable form, no patient portal, and no records request page. Its privacy policy directs patients to write to the Privacy Officer at corporate headquarters — a mail-only pathway with no form to guide the request. Individual affiliates handle records requests independently: some offer downloadable PDF forms (Center for Sight, Georgia Retina), others use third-party online portals like Sharecare (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye Partners), and at least one has a broken forms page (Georgia Eye Partners, returning 404).

The most relevant forms for patient self-access are the two retrieved PDF forms. **Form 1** (Center for Sight) is a concise, plain-language "Medical Information Release Form" with a patient-friendly tone and 10-business-day processing commitment. **Form 2** (Georgia Retina) is a more detailed "Authorization for Use, Release, or Request of Your Health Information" with HIPAA rights statements but also a $25 fee disclosure and a reason-for-release requirement. Both are one-page, single-purpose authorization forms. Form 1 represents the better patient experience overall and is treated as the primary form for scoring purposes.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to move records "to or from" the affiliated practice. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal right to their own records without needing to provide a reason. The parent organization provides no pathway at all — a patient who only knows they received care "under EyeSouth Partners" would struggle to find any usable process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms required significant effort. Direct searches for "EyeSouth Partners" ROI forms returned nothing. The corporate website has no patient resources section. Forms were located only by identifying specific affiliated practices and searching their individual websites. This multi-step, knowledge-dependent process is a major barrier: a patient must already know which specific practice treated them, find that practice's website, and hope a form is posted there.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms have a text layer (not image-only scans) but **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete by hand. Form 1 uses plain, accessible language with a logical top-down flow (patient info → sender/receiver → date range → reasons → authorization → signature). Its listing of 11 Center for Sight locations with full addresses and fax numbers is dense but functional for identifying where to send the form. Form 2 is more text-dense, with rights disclosures consuming half the page and no visual section headers or dividers. Neither form offers checkboxes for record types, format/delivery options, or electronic submission instructions.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form 1 contains an indefinite authorization ("will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing") with no automatic expiration — potentially problematic under HIPAA § 164.508. Form 2 discloses a flat $25 fee for record reproduction without distinguishing patient access requests (where HIPAA fee limits apply) from third-party releases. Form 2 also asks patients to "list the reason for releasing this information," which HIPAA does not require for patient access. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both imply fax submission is available through listed fax numbers. Form 2 is dated June 2016 — nearly a decade old, predating the HHS Right of Access Initiative and the Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Notable Strengths

- Form 1's 10-business-day processing commitment sets a clear, HIPAA-compliant expectation
- Form 1's warm closing ("we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care") is unusually humanizing
- Both forms are appropriately concise at one page each
- No notarization or witness requirements on either form

## Overall Assessment

EyeSouth Partners presents a below-average patient experience for records access. The fundamental problem is structural: a decentralized PMO with no centralized patient-facing process, forcing patients to navigate affiliate-specific pathways that vary widely in approach and quality. The best available forms are generic authorization documents that don't recognize patient self-access as a distinct use case. While the forms themselves are functional and concise, their paper-first design (no fillable fields), lack of patient rights language, and compliance issues (indefinite authorization, flat fee, reason requirement) prevent them from achieving more than a middling score. The organization earns a **C** grade, reflecting adequate but unexceptional service that requires a patient to work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights.

# Wayne County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Monticello, Kentucky. The facility provides a single one-page form for patients requesting their own medical records, along with a parallel web-based HTML form that captures equivalent information online. For a small rural hospital, the availability of dual pathways — PDF and online — is notably progressive.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Only one downloadable PDF was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." This is a patient-access-oriented form, not a generic third-party authorization. The title and structure center on patient self-access, with "self" listed first among record-ownership options (self, child, other). The hospital also offers a web-based HTML form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` that collects equivalent information and allows electronic submission — a genuinely useful alternative to the print-and-deliver workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Wayne County Hospital does a better-than-average job distinguishing patient self-access from third-party release. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" rather than "Authorization for Release of Information," and the patient is addressed directly as the expected user. However, the same single form is used for all requesters — self, child, or other — with no separate instructions or additional authorization requirements for third-party requests. There is no dedicated third-party release form, which means the form functions as a blended instrument, though its default orientation is clearly toward patient access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted web search. The form lives at `/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf` — a media library path that is not linked from any navigable page on the hospital website. The HIM department page provides a phone number but no form download link. There is no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. A patient browsing the website would likely not discover the PDF without calling HIM or using a search engine. The web-based form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` may be more discoverable through site navigation, though this was not confirmed. Retrieval difficulty is moderate — not hard, but requiring search engine assistance rather than intuitive site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable single page. It has a text layer (not a scan) and uses only three fonts, but all fields are represented as underscore blanks — a print-and-handwrite design. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → request type and delivery method → record ownership → dates of service → specific records requested (10 checkboxes) → reason for request → identification presented → signatures. The language is plain and accessible with no legalese. One page is an appropriate length for this type of request.

Delivery options are strong: fax, email, mail, and pick-up. Email as a delivery option is uncommon at critical access hospitals and reduces barriers for rural patients who may live far from the facility.

## Barriers & Compliance Concerns

**Witness requirement:** The form includes a separate "Witness" signature line. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access requests, and this creates a meaningful barrier — a patient filling out the form at home must find a witness before submitting. This is particularly burdensome for rural and isolated patients.

**Reason for request:** The form asks patients to check a reason (Continuity of Care, Personal Interest, Insurance Claims Processing, Legal Claims Processing, Other) without indicating this is optional. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not justify their request.

**Submission method not specified on PDF:** The form itself does not state where or how to return it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is printed on the document. However, the existence of the web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` provides a clear electronic submission pathway.

**Fee transparency:** The form prominently states "Based on KRS 422.317 a first copy of a patient's record will be provided free, subsequent copies may be charged." This Kentucky-law-based disclosure of free first copies is unusually transparent for a facility of this size.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dual pathway (PDF + web form):** Offering both a downloadable PDF and an online web form is exceptional for a 25-bed critical access hospital.
- **Free-copy disclosure on the form itself:** Citing KRS 422.317 about free first copies directly on the form is a bright spot few larger organizations match.
- **Email delivery option:** Including email alongside fax, mail, and pick-up is forward-thinking.
- **One-page brevity:** No unnecessary legal boilerplate — approachable and quick to complete.

## Overall Assessment

Wayne County Hospital demonstrates a patient-centered approach that exceeds expectations for its size and setting. The form is clearly designed for patient self-access, the language is plain, and the availability of an online web form and email delivery are genuine differentiators. The main weaknesses are the witness signature requirement (a real barrier with no legal basis for patient access requests), the unfindability of the PDF on the website, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF. Despite these issues, the overall pathway is solid — a patient can submit their request electronically via the web form, receive records by email, and pay nothing for a first copy.

# Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital is part of Samaritan Health Services (SHS), a nonprofit regional health system in Oregon's Willamette Valley. All records request forms and processes operate at the system level — there are no facility-specific forms for the Lebanon campus. Five documents were retrieved: a standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information in English (form-4) and Spanish (form-5), a specialized Computer Readable EHI Export Request in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3).

## Pathways Available

SHS offers three distinct pathways for patients requesting their own records:

1. **MRO Express Online Portal** — The primary pathway the website directs patients toward. This is an outsourced third-party portal (MRO Corp.) for submitting records requests online. No downloadable PDF is produced; the request is web-based.

2. **Standard Authorization Form (form-4/form-5)** — A general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" PDF covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Submittable by mail, fax, or email. Available in English and Spanish.

3. **EHI Computer Readable Export Form (form-1/form-2)** — A specialized form for requesting health information in machine-readable format. Also available in English and Spanish. This is a notably rare offering.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The standard form (form-4) is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it handles the distinction reasonably well: Section 3 includes a "Personal" checkbox for purpose, and Section 7 splits into "released to myself" (with multiple delivery options) versus "OR release my records to" a third party. This is a combined form, not a dedicated patient access pathway, but the dual structure is functional and the patient self-access route is clearly accommodated.

The EHI export form (form-1) is genuinely patient-centric — its purpose field comes pre-checked as "Patient Request - Electronic" and the entire form is designed around patient self-access. However, this serves only the niche use case of computer-readable data export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the downloadable forms was **difficult**. The medical records request page primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal. The PDF form download links are hidden inside a collapsed accordion section titled "Sending a Request by Mail or Fax" that required browser DevTools (JavaScript link extraction) to discover. Web searches returned confusable results from unrelated organizations with similar names. A patient who prefers a traditional form rather than the online portal would struggle to find the PDF.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-4) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean text and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete it by hand despite the form being digital in origin. The form uses numbered sections (1–9) with clear headers and a matching instruction page. The language mixes functional plain language with legal boilerplate; the rights section is dense but the instructions on page 2 are more accessible. Record type granularity is strong, with 11 specific checkboxes plus an "Other" field.

Format and delivery options are a genuine bright spot: patients can choose from MyChart, email, paper, CD, fax, or write in an alternative. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery, which is uncommon among ROI forms.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees**: The fee disclosure is exemplary. Form-4 explicitly states "Initial Patient Request: No Charge" and "Continuing Care: No Charge," with fees only for third-party requests. However, the EHI export form (form-1) lacks this "no charge" language, stating only that "reasonable cost-based fees apply" — an inconsistency that could deter patients seeking computer-readable data.

**Processing time**: Stated as "up to 30 days," within HIPAA's permitted window.

**No notarization** required. No in-person-only submission requirement — mail, fax, and email are all accepted.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by mail, fax (541-768-9363), or email (SHSHIMROI@samhealth.org). The email option is notable — it allows fully electronic submission even without the MRO portal, though the non-fillable PDF creates an awkward print-fill-scan-email workflow.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: All forms (standard ROI and EHI export) are available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Dedicated EHI export form**: Offering a separate form specifically for computer-readable health information export is exceptionally rare and demonstrates genuine Cures Act awareness.
- **Fee transparency**: The three-tier fee structure with "No Charge" for patient requests is clear and patient-friendly.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Six format options including two electronic channels (MyChart and email).
- **Email submission channel**: Accepting form submission via email lowers barriers significantly.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDFs**: All forms have zero interactive fields despite being digitally authored — a clear missed opportunity.
- **Hidden download links**: The downloadable forms are buried in collapsed accordion sections, requiring technical effort to discover.
- **No dedicated patient access form**: The standard form serves both patient self-access and third-party release, requiring patients to navigate which sections apply.
- **EHI export fee ambiguity**: The EHI form does not match the standard form's "no charge" commitment for patient requests.

## Overall Assessment

Samaritan Health Services provides a solid, above-average experience for patients requesting their own records. The combination of an online portal as the primary pathway, a well-structured authorization form with multiple delivery options, bilingual availability, transparent fee disclosures, and a rare dedicated EHI export form puts this organization ahead of most peers. The main gaps are the non-fillable PDF forms and the poor discoverability of the downloadable form option. The organization clearly takes patient access seriously, even if the form design hasn't been fully modernized for digital-first completion.

# Memorial Healthcare System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Memorial Healthcare System (Hollywood, FL) is a government-owned regional hospital system serving South Florida. The system's medical records page provides a single general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" form available in three languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole), plus a separate Request for Amendment form. There is no dedicated patient self-access form; all record requests flow through the same HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release.

## Pathways and Primary Form

The primary pathway is a downloadable PDF form (form-1.pdf in English) linked from the main website at Patients & Visitors > Medical Records. The form lists five delivery methods — Pick-up, Mail Out, e-Delivery, CD, and MyChart — prominently at the top, showing the org supports both traditional and electronic record delivery. MyChart is referenced as a delivery option, suggesting patients may also be able to request records through their patient portal. The medical records page states a two-business-day processing commitment, far faster than the HIPAA-allowed 30-day window.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Memorial does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is titled "Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records" and is structured around disclosing records to a named recipient (Section 4: "This information is to be released to: Name / Address"). While an email field explicitly reads "I request my records be sent to me at this e-mail address" — clear patient-access language — the overall form design is a generic authorization. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and Section 5h requires patients to state a purpose for the disclosure, which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form and process as an attorney or insurer, figuring out which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The medical records page is linked from the main navigation, the PDF is directly downloadable without login or CAPTCHA, and all language versions are grouped on the same page. No bot blocking was encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields** — every checkbox, text field, and signature line must be completed by hand after printing. This is consistent across all three language versions. The file is bloated at 2.45 MB (vs. ~700 KB for the identically structured Spanish and Creole versions), with 23 embedded fonts and garbled hidden content from overlapping template layers — including staff business cards, physician rosters, and internal template labels like "JDCH Oncology BC (Multiple Doctors & Locations) FRONT." This hidden content inflates file size and produces garbled output for assistive technologies.

The form's content is organized in five numbered sections with logical flow: facility selection, patient identification, record type selection (~15 granular options), recipient information, and acknowledgment statements. The acknowledgments (Sections 5a–5h) are dense legal text — particularly the electronic delivery risk-shifting language in 5e, which requires patients to "knowingly and voluntarily assume this risk and all consequences, losses and damages" for electronic records. This language could discourage patients from exercising their right to receive records electronically.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

**No notarization or witness is required.** Fees are not disclosed on the form itself; the website mentions "copy charges as authorized by Florida law" with an exception for records sent to treating physicians. The six-month authorization expiration is standard. No in-person-only submission restriction exists — forms can be mailed. However, there is no explicit electronic submission pathway for the form itself (no fax, no email-based submission explicitly stated, though MyChart may serve this role).

**Bright spots** are notable. The trilingual availability (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole) is exemplary and uncommon — most organizations offer at most English and Spanish. The five delivery methods, including e-Delivery and MyChart, are forward-thinking. The two-business-day processing commitment is remarkably fast. Granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control.

**Red flags** include the electronic delivery risk-shifting language (Section 5e), the purpose field that may create an impression that patients need to justify their access, and the bloated English PDF with garbled hidden content that affects accessibility tools.

## Overall Assessment

Memorial Healthcare System demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness in several areas — multilingual access, fast processing, and electronic delivery options — but is held back by a non-fillable, generic authorization form that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The form's paper-based workflow and dense legal language create unnecessary friction. The org earns a solid **B** grade overall: excellent findability and some compliance strengths offset by a fundamentally paper-based process and a form that wasn't designed with patients as the primary audience.

# Cordova Community Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cordova Community Medical Center (CCMC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Cordova, Alaska. It offers a single Release of Information form for all medical records requests — a one-page, general-purpose HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. There is no patient portal, online request wizard, or dedicated patient access form.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

CCMC provides one pathway for records requests: a downloadable PDF authorization form linked from the Medical Records page at `https://www.cdvcmc.com/for-patients/medical-records/`. The form can be printed, completed by hand, and faxed to Medical Records at (907) 424-8406 or the Clinic Nurse at (907) 424-8202. No online submission portal, email submission option, or patient portal alternative exists. The website's Medical Records page reportedly discusses format options for receiving records (paper, email, CD, or fax), but the form itself does not capture a delivery format preference.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

CCMC does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured around "Release my information to [NAME]" — a third-party release frame. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in the recipient field and select "Personal reasons" as the purpose, which is unintuitive. The purpose checkboxes ("Continuation of care," "Insurance purposes," "Employer requirement," "Legal review") are overwhelmingly third-party scenarios. While technically usable for patient self-access, the form was clearly designed around the third-party authorization model, not individual access rights under HIPAA.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF URL. The Medical Records page is intuitively located under "For Patients" and links directly to the form download. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, authentication, or portal login was encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences possible — a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a flat (non-fillable) PDF — digitally authored with a proper text layer, but with zero interactive fields. Patients must print and handwrite all entries. At one page and approximately 15 fields (patient name, DOB, MR#, recipient name/address/phone, purpose checkboxes, record type checkboxes, date range, sensitive information initial, signature, and date), the scope is reasonable. The layout uses a numbered section structure (1–7) that flows logically from authorization through scope, limitations, revocation, rights, and signature. However, the dense legal text in sections 3–7 and the redisclosure notice create a visually cramped single page. Three fonts provide some typographic hierarchy. The language shifts from accessible in the early sections to regulatory legalese in the later sections, particularly around revocation and redisclosure.

Section 2 offers excellent record-type granularity — twelve specific categories plus "Other" and date-range fields — giving patients meaningful control over what is released. Section 7's acceptance of photocopies as originals is a practical accommodation.

## Barriers

No notarization is required. Photo ID "may be required" — stated as a possibility, not an absolute mandate. No fees are mentioned on the form. The form expires three months from signature, which is short but sufficient for a single access request. There is no stated turnaround time on the form itself.

A notable concern is Section 3's all-or-nothing handling of sensitive information: alcohol/drug abuse, HIV-AIDS, mental health, and psychiatric treatment are bundled into a single initial, with an undefined "qualify above" alternative. This is problematic given the form's own citation of 42 CFR Part 2 protections for substance abuse records, which require specific consent for each disclosure.

The form's 45 CFR 164.524 citation is misapplied — used in the redisclosure context rather than to inform patients of their access rights. The form was last updated in 2016, making it nearly a decade old.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:** Excellent findability; compact single-page design; comprehensive record-type selection; photocopies accepted; fax submission available (adequate electronic pathway).

**Weaknesses:** Not fillable; does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release; sensitive information bundling; stale document (2016); delivery format not captured on form; legal language in later sections.

## Overall Assessment

CCMC provides a functional but dated records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it was designed for third-party release rather than patient self-access. The non-fillable format and print-fax workflow reflect a paper-first mindset. For a small, remote critical access hospital, the form is adequate but falls short of patient-centered design. A patient can navigate the process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary user.

# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, a nonprofit community hospital in Downers Grove, IL, operates under the Advocate Health system and uses system-wide forms for medical records requests. The organization distinguishes itself by maintaining a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-4, "Patient Request for Health Information") that is clearly separated from its third-party authorization form (form-5, "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information"). This separation is a best practice that most healthcare organizations do not follow.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Seven documents were retrieved, but only four are relevant to patient medical records access:

- **Form-4** (primary): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a single-page form designed specifically for patients requesting their own records, with a "Myself" checkbox, portal callout, and five delivery method options.
- **Form-5**: "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — the third-party disclosure authorization, a companion to form-4.
- **Form-6**: Spanish-language authorization form (corresponds to the third-party release, not the patient self-request form).
- **Form-7**: Step-by-step instructions for completing the authorization form, with a portal-first framing.

The remaining forms (form-1, form-2, form-3) are Employee Assistance Program releases or a legacy Advocate Medical Group form — none relevant to hospital patient access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocate Health earns high marks for pathway differentiation. Form-4 is explicitly titled "Patient Request for Health Information" and opens with a prominent callout: *"Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org."* The form's first recipient option is "☐ Myself." This is a clear, dedicated patient access pathway — patients are not forced through a generic third-party authorization workflow.

The organization also offers the LiveWell patient portal as an alternative digital pathway, referenced on both form-4 and the instructions document (form-7). This portal-first suggestion is a notable patient-centered design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Advocate Health medical records page (advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records) clearly lists both primary forms with direct PDF download links, plus the Spanish version and instructions. No bot blocking was encountered, and all PDFs downloaded successfully. The main challenge was that the system-level organization of forms means patients searching specifically for "Good Samaritan Hospital" forms may not immediately find the centralized system page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the patient self-access form, is a well-designed single-page document that fits patient demographics, 22+ record-type checkboxes (across medical records, imaging, and billing categories), delivery method options, sensitive information acknowledgment, and signature blocks into one page. The layout is logical with clear three-column organization for record types. Language is plain and accessible.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a born-digital PDF with 8 embedded fonts and clean vector graphics. Patients must print and hand-fill, a significant missed opportunity. The form also **lacks submission instructions** — there is no mailing address, fax number, or email address telling patients where to send the completed form.

Five delivery methods are offered: paper copy by mail, CD, encrypted email, patient portal, and in-person pick-up. The inclusion of encrypted email is uncommon and welcome.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form is relatively barrier-free: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person-only submission mandate. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("Fees may apply") without amounts or a fee schedule reference. No response time is stated. Form-4 does not include an explicit patient rights statement, though form-5's companion rights section covers revocation, non-conditioning, and re-disclosure.

A notable gap exists for Spanish-speaking patients: the Spanish-language form (form-6) corresponds to the third-party authorization, not the patient self-request form. Spanish-speaking patients must use a more complex disclosure authorization to request their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, via its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its dedicated patient access form and portal-first messaging. The differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release is a model for other organizations. The form's content design is solid — concise, well-organized, and comprehensive in scope options. The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a paper workflow for the form itself), missing submission instructions, and vague fee language. The patient portal provides a digital alternative that partially compensates for the PDF's limitations. Overall, this organization provides an above-average patient experience for records access, earning a **B** grade.

# Penobscot Community Health Care — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC based in Bangor, Maine. Two PDF forms were found, but they are identical documents hosted at different WordPress upload paths (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf share the same text, revision date, and form code MRC001). The organization's primary records request pathway is a third-party Datavant/Swellbox online portal, linked from the Health Information Management page. The PDF authorization form exists on the server but is not linked from any patient-facing page.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Dedicated Patient Access

PCHC does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. The sole PDF form is titled "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" and covers both disclosing records TO a third party and obtaining records FROM a third party. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the same form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties — including naming themselves as the recipient and navigating redisclosure warnings that don't apply to self-access. The purpose checkbox "At my request" is available but does not clearly distinguish individual access rights from authorized third-party release.

The Datavant/Swellbox portal (https://www.swellbox.com/pchc-wizard.html) is the pathway the organization actively directs patients toward from its website. While this provides a digital alternative, the PDF form — the only org-created document available for evaluation — remains a generic HIPAA authorization with no patient access specialization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted Google search (`filetype:pdf` query); it was **not discoverable** through normal website navigation. The HIM page (https://pchc.com/healthinformation/) links to the Datavant portal and a Privacy Practices Booklet, but not the authorization form PDF. Two identical copies at different URLs (`/2024/03/` and `/2021/11/` paths) create version-control confusion. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. Difficulty: moderate — the portal is findable from the website, but the PDF form is effectively hidden.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive fields) across 2 pages. Patients must print it, handwrite all entries, and submit physically. Despite the non-fillable format, the document itself is well-structured with clear, labeled sections progressing logically: patient identification → authorization direction → recipient details → delivery method → record types → sensitive information → purpose → duration → rights acknowledgments → signature. Approximately 18 fields require completion for a basic self-access request.

The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology. Core instructions ("To DISCLOSE my health information below TO:") are clear with helpful capitalization for emphasis, but several sections use dense legal prose. The "continuing communications" clause and opt-out-by-striking mechanisms are particularly confusing — patients must physically strike out text to limit scope, and failure to do so defaults to the broadest possible authorization, including ongoing disclosure of future encounters.

Record type granularity is good, offering seven specific categories plus an open-ended option, with date-range filtering. Four delivery methods are available: mail (defaulting to CD), fax, email via secure portal, and verbal communication.

## Barriers and Compliance

No fees are disclosed — neither excessive charges nor explicit statements of no-fee patient access. No notarization or witness is required. The form does not specify submission instructions, though PCHC's fax number (207-990-1248), mailing address, and email (PCHCMR@pchc.com) are provided in the header, implying fax and mail submission are available.

Compliance elements are generally sound: oral revocation is permitted, the non-conditioning statement is present, 42 CFR Part 2 redisclosure notice is properly included, and sensitive information categories require affirmative opt-in. However, the form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or reference the patient's right of access. The office-use section includes an unusual and commendable accountability checkbox requiring staff to flag partial or incomplete disclosures.

## Bright Spots

- **Secure email delivery** via PCHC's portal (records sent as PDFs accessible through a secure messaging system)
- **Oral revocation** permitted — more accessible than written-only requirements
- **Partial disclosure transparency** — internal checkbox requiring notification when records provided are incomplete
- **Datavant/Swellbox portal** provides an alternative digital pathway beyond the paper form

## Red Flags

- **PDF form is unlinkable from the website** — HIM page directs exclusively to Datavant, making the org's own form effectively hidden
- **Opt-out-by-striking defaults** to broadest possible authorization for continuing communications and third-party-received records
- **CD as default mail delivery** medium — outdated and likely unusable for many patients

## Overall Assessment

PCHC provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The organization deserves credit for offering a Datavant portal as a digital pathway and for several thoughtful compliance provisions. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access form, the non-fillable PDF, the hidden form URL, and the confusing opt-out defaults limit patient-centeredness. A patient navigating PCHC's website would be funneled to the Datavant portal — a workable option — but would struggle to find or use the organization's own authorization form independently.

# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Medical Center (CMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Toms River, NJ, part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also offers a Ciox/Swellbox online records request portal as the primary pathway for patients.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF documents were downloaded:

- **form-1.pdf** — A CMC-specific one-page "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility" (2017, image-only scan, no fillable fields). This is the legacy facility-level outbound release form.
- **form-2.pdf** — A one-page "Request for Release of Health Information *to* CMC" (2015/2021, image-only scan). This is an inbound records transfer form and is **not relevant** for a patient requesting their own records.
- **form-3.pdf** — The system-wide RWJBH "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (3 pages, Nov 2025, has text layer but no fillable fields). This is the most current and comprehensive form, covering all RWJBH locations. It is the best available PDF for patient self-access.

Beyond PDF forms, the medical records page prominently features a **Ciox/Swellbox online portal** for electronic records requests. Fax (732-557-2209) and email (cmcroimedicalrecords@rwjbh.org) submission options are also available.

## Patient Access Pathway

CMC does not offer a dedicated form specifically designed for patient self-access. Both the legacy CMC form (form-1) and the system-wide form (form-3) are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient access, third-party requests, insurance, legal, and continuing care. On form-3, "Personal" appears as a purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care/Treatment," "Insurance," and "Legal," but the patient must name themselves as the recipient in a field clearly designed for third-party organizations. The Swellbox online portal, however, may provide a more patient-centric experience as a purpose-built records request tool, and the organization directs patients toward it as the primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was straightforward. A direct web search for CMC medical records authorization returned the facility's medical records page immediately. The page links to the CMC-specific forms and references the online portal. The system-wide form (form-3) required a separate search at the RWJBH system level. No bot blocking or authentication barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing form-3 (the best available PDF): the document has a text layer and clean digital rendering (created in Word, not scanned), but **lacks fillable fields** — a patient must print it and complete it by hand. The layout is well-organized with a logical flow: patient demographics → facility selection → recipient → delivery method → record types → purpose → legal terms → signature. Record type selection is granular (15+ checkboxes including behavioral health, pathology, and imaging). Page 3 provides a helpful contact directory for all RWJBH facility HIM departments. Legal text on page 2 is dense but not impenetrably so. The facility checkbox grid on page 1 is visually crowded but functional. The older CMC-specific forms (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans with zero accessibility — no text layer, no fillable fields, no screen reader support.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-3 includes anti-conditioning language ("my refusal will not affect the start, continuation or quality of my medical treatment") and clear revocation rights. No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is **vague**: records are free when sent to another provider for care, but "there may be a fee" for other requests with no schedule or amounts provided. HIPAA cost-based fee limits for patient access are not mentioned. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The 180-day authorization expiration is reasonable.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods** on form-3: paper pickup, US Mail, encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format" — far better than most ROI forms.
- **Online portal** (Swellbox) provides a fully digital pathway alongside PDF forms.
- **Comprehensive contact directory** (page 3) with phone and fax for every RWJBH HIM department.
- **Multiple submission channels**: fax, email, online portal, and mail.

## Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any PDF form despite digital creation.
- **Generic authorization form** — no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow.
- **Opaque fee disclosure** — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.
- **Legacy CMC forms** (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans that remain linked on the website alongside the modern system-wide form, creating potential confusion.

## Overall Assessment

Community Medical Center earns a **B** overall. The organization benefits significantly from the Swellbox online portal and strong delivery method options on the system-wide form. The retrieval experience is easy and multiple submission channels exist. However, the PDF forms are non-fillable and generic, the fee disclosure is vague, and there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow. The coexistence of legacy image-only scans alongside a modern system-wide form reflects incomplete digital modernization.

# Ben Taub Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ben Taub Hospital is a government-owned community hospital in Houston, TX, part of the **Harris Health System**. It uses system-level forms for medical records requests — both downloaded PDFs are branded Harris Health documents, not Ben Taub–specific materials.

## Forms & Pathways

Two forms were retrieved. **Form-1** ("Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information") is the sole relevant document for a patient seeking their own records. **Form-2** is a marketing/media authorization unrelated to patient record access. Only form-1 is assessed below.

The medical records page at harrishealth.org clearly explains the request process and offers four submission channels: **mail, fax, email, and in-person drop-off**. Contact details — including phone (346-426-0980), fax (346-426-0959), and a dedicated email (Releaseofinformation@harrishealth.org) — are printed directly on the form. A patient can fill the form digitally and submit via fax or email without visiting the facility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Harris Health uses a **single dual-purpose authorization form** for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form handles this well through conditional sections: the "Purpose of Request/Disclosure" and "Expiration" sections are explicitly marked as "only required if the individual providing this authorization form to Harris Health is someone other than the patient." This means patients can skip irrelevant sections without needing a separate form. It is not a dedicated patient access form, but it clearly accommodates patient self-access as a first-class use case.

The email delivery option is labeled "Email Address (Patients Only)," further demonstrating that patient access is specifically considered in the form's design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and it is directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or rendering issues were encountered. The PDF URL is descriptive and identifiable in search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **65 interactive form fields** — a strong digital-first design. However, the fields lack programmatic names, reducing accessibility for screen readers and auto-fill. The form covers patient identification, recipient details, facility selection (with Ben Taub specifically listed), 14+ record type checkboxes, format options (paper, CD, email), sensitive information consent, and signature blocks — all on one page.

The layout is **dense but logically organized**, flowing from patient info → recipient → records scope → format → purpose → expiration → signatures. Section headers are minimal, and the cramped single-page layout sacrifices visual clarity for compactness. Language is moderately clear, leaning toward legal/administrative phrasing, but includes a well-worded non-conditioning statement. The form was recently revised (December 2024), suggesting active document management.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization is required and no fees are mentioned. Multiple submission channels are available. One notable concern: the form includes a **witness signature line** without clarifying whether a witness is truly required or who qualifies. This could be a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.

The form's footer includes an **internal intranet URL** (apps.hchd.local) — inaccessible to patients and a document-control oversight. The fillable fields lack programmatic names, an accessibility deficiency.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery explicitly for patients** — the "Patients Only" label on the email option is a meaningful patient-access accommodation
- **Conditional sections** that let patients skip third-party–only fields
- **Granular record type selection** with 14+ categories and proper psychotherapy notes separation
- **Multiple submission channels** with contact details printed on the form
- **Dedicated authorization withdrawal email** (AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org)

## Overall Assessment

Ben Taub Hospital, through Harris Health System, provides a **competent, accessible records request process**. The form is findable, fillable, and submittable electronically. While it uses a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, it thoughtfully accommodates patient self-access through conditional sections and patient-specific features like email delivery. The witness signature ambiguity and unnamed form fields are the primary weaknesses. Overall, this represents a solid B-level experience — functional and reasonably patient-friendly, with room for improvement in form clarity and dedicated patient access design.

# University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two versions of the same form were found: **Form 1989 ("ADMIN – Consent to Release of Information and Right of Access Request")**. Form-1 is the current official version (revised May 2024), hosted on the university's healthcare domain. Form-2 is an older revision (August 2021) hosted on a third-party CDN, pre-populated for a driving rehabilitation service ("Safer Driver Solutions"). Form-1 is the canonical, patient-facing document; form-2 is irrelevant for direct patient self-access and is included only for completeness.

The organization directs patients to a clear medical records request page at `uihc.org/medical-records-request`, which links to the PDF form and provides submission instructions. Submission options include email (`him-consentform@uiowa.edu`), fax (two numbers), and physical mail — a notably flexible set of channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form title explicitly names both functions: "Consent to Release of Information **AND** Right of Access Request." This dual-purpose naming is unusual and shows awareness that patients may exercise their HIPAA right of access. However, the form body does not differentiate the two use cases. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no separate workflow, and — critically — no "send records to myself" shortcut. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Send UI Health Care information to" field, effectively treating themselves as a third party. Ironically, the older form-2 included a "Myself at the address above unless noted below" option, which the current revision dropped.

The organization does not distinguish between individual access requests (governed by HIPAA § 164.524) and third-party authorization (governed by § 164.508) in its process or documentation. This is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that acknowledges patient access in name only.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF link. The official medical records page provides clear context and instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, CAPTCHAs, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, natively digital PDF with a clean text layer (4,233 characters). Despite being digitally created, it has **zero fillable fields** — a significant regression from the older form-2, which had 50 fillable fields. Patients must print the form, complete it by hand, scan it, and then submit electronically (email or fax) or by mail. The form's consent language acknowledges electronic completion ("as valid as if you signed the consent in writing"), creating a paradox: the form claims to support electronic completion but provides no interactive fields to enable it.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient → format options → record types → date range → reason → consent → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Sections are spatially separated but lack labeled headers. The language is generally clear, though the consent block contains moderately dense legal prose. Record type options are comprehensive (16+ checkboxes), and the form thoughtfully includes legacy entity lines for patients who received care under prior organizational names (Corridor OB GYN, Mercy Clinics, Mercy Hospital).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states a 30-day response commitment, aligning with HIPAA requirements. The non-conditioning statement is present and properly worded. Fee disclosure is vague: "I understand there may be a charge for this information" — without distinguishing between patient access fees (limited under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. Revocation requires written notification to the Director of Health Information Management, a minor but unnecessary barrier.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Exceptional findability. Multiple electronic submission channels including email. Dual-purpose form title acknowledging right of access. Legacy entity lines accommodating merged organizations. Comprehensive record type selection. Five delivery format options including electronic media (CD, USB, email).

**Red flags**: The current official form regressed from 50 fillable fields to zero — a clear step backward in digital accessibility. The removal of the "Myself" recipient option from the current form makes patient self-access less intuitive than in the older version. Vague fee language fails to inform patients of their right to cost-based fees under HIPAA.

## Overall Assessment

University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics earns credit for excellent findability, multiple submission channels, and a form that at least names patient access in its title. However, the lack of fillable fields on the current form, the absence of a differentiated patient self-access pathway, and the regression from the more interactive older version weigh against it. The organization provides an adequate but not patient-centered experience — a patient can get their records, but must navigate a form designed primarily for third-party authorization using a print-and-fill workflow.

# Synthesis: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center

## Forms and Pathways

OSU Wexner Medical Center publishes two PDF forms on its [Medical Records page](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records), both titled "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (form ID MC040184, revised 11/2019). Form-1 is a single-page image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields — essentially a digitized paper artifact. Form-2 is a two-page digitally authored PDF that bundles numbered instructions (page 1) with the same authorization form (page 2). Form-2 has a full text layer and 25 embedded fonts but, despite being created in Adobe Acrobat Pro, still has zero fillable fields. Both forms use the same layout and legal text. Form-2 is clearly the better document and serves as the basis for this assessment.

The organization does not appear to offer a patient portal-based records request, an online submission wizard (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), or any other digital request pathway. Submission instructions list three physical mailing addresses and phone numbers for the Medical Information Management offices. No fax number or email address is listed for submitting the completed form. The form does accept eSignatures ("e.g., Adobe") with a date and time stamp, which opens the possibility that a patient could fill the form digitally using annotation tools and email or fax it — but no such submission channel is explicitly provided on the form itself.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

OSU Wexner does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same "Authorization to Release Medical Information" form is used whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney, insurer, or other third party is requesting them. The form's "Release Information To" section uses a sender-recipient model without any acknowledgment that a patient requesting their own records has distinct rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). There is no mention of the Right of Access anywhere on either form. Patients must complete the same "Purpose of Disclosure" field (with no guidance that they are not legally required to state a purpose for their own records), select facilities, and navigate the same legal text as any third-party requester.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned direct download links on the first attempt, and the forms are clearly linked from the organization's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor friction is the presence of two versions of the same form without guidance on which to use — a patient might download the image-only scan (form-1) and have a worse experience.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2's instructions page is a genuine bright spot: seven numbered items correspond to form sections, with practical guidance like "If uncertain about the location, select all box locations." The form itself offers granular record-type checkboxes (11 categories including Emergency Dept, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, Radiology, Pathology, etc.), multi-facility selection across 8 OSU locations, and reasonable purpose-of-disclosure options. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the form page is quite dense — it packs all fields, checkboxes, four paragraphs of legal text, signature lines, and three submission address blocks onto a single page, resulting in small font sizes and cramped spacing. The language mixes accessible instructions with HIPAA-derived terms ("designated record set," "re-disclosed by the recipient") that may confuse patients. Critically, despite being authored in Acrobat Pro, the form has no fillable fields — patients must print and handwrite.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is fee opacity. The form states "a fee may be charged" and directs all billing questions to CIOX Health (1-800-367-1500), a third-party ROI vendor, without any fee schedule or distinction between patient-access and third-party fees. For patient self-access, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts; the lack of transparency here raises concerns. The instructions require "all sections must be completed in their entirety," which means patients must state a purpose — not required by HIPAA for individual access. No notarization is required, and the witness signature is optional, which is positive. The form has not been updated since November 2019, predating the 2021 information blocking rules and 2024 42 CFR Part 2 revisions.

## Bright Spots

- Dedicated, well-structured instructions page with numbered items
- Granular record-type selection (11 categories)
- Multi-facility selection with practical guidance for uncertain patients
- eSignature acceptance (Adobe)
- Correct substance use disorder and psychotherapy notes disclosures

## Overall Assessment

OSU Wexner Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably organized ROI form with useful instructions, but falls short on digital accessibility (no fillable fields, no electronic submission channel), patient-centeredness (no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release), and fee transparency. The process is fundamentally a print-and-mail paper workflow dressed in a PDF wrapper.

# OrthoCarolina — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

OrthoCarolina, an independent for-profit orthopedic practice in Charlotte, NC, offers a single generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests — whether the patient is requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party. Three versions of this form (dated 2017, 2020, and 2023) remain simultaneously available at different URLs on the organization's website. The most current version (form-1, revised 04/2023) is the primary form linked from the medical records resource page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

OrthoCarolina does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All requests flow through the same "Authorization for Access/Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under Purpose of Release, which at least signals that patient self-requests are a recognized use case. However, the mandatory recipient section ("This information is to be disclosed to the following individual or entity (MUST BE COMPLETED)") forces patients requesting their own records to awkwardly list themselves as the disclosure target — a design that treats self-access as just another flavor of third-party release rather than a distinct right under HIPAA § 164.524.

The form makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access, does not explain patient rights to receive records within 30 days, and does not distinguish the fee structure for patient access (which must be reasonable and cost-based) from third-party release fees.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned both the direct PDF link and OrthoCarolina's medical records resource page. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or browser fallback was needed — forms downloaded cleanly via direct URL. The main findability concern is version confusion: three nearly identical forms exist at three different public URLs with no version indicators in the filenames, no redirects from old URLs, and different fax numbers across versions (the 2017 form lists a different fax number). A patient who finds form-2 via a search engine could submit to the wrong fax number.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being revised as recently as April 2023, it uses underscored blank lines throughout, requiring patients to print and handwrite. A patient determined to complete it digitally would need third-party PDF annotation tools — a workaround, not a designed workflow.

The layout is dense but follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → records requested → radiology images → recipient → purpose → fee notice → delivery method → sensitive information consent → signature. However, the single-page constraint leads to cramped formatting, and the delivery method section has a known layout defect where authorization expiration language overlaps with delivery checkboxes, producing garbled text in the PDF's text layer (problematic for screen readers).

The language is mostly plain, though the sensitive-information consent and revocation clauses run together in a single dense paragraph. The newer form-1 dropped the prominent "YOU MAY REFUSE TO SIGN THIS AUTHORIZATION" notice that appeared in both older versions — a regression in patient-rights transparency.

## Submission & Delivery

OrthoCarolina offers notably comprehensive submission and delivery options. The form can be submitted via mail, email (OrthoCarolinaMedRec@orthocarolina.com), fax, or patient portal upload. For record delivery, seven options are available: patient portal upload, email (for both records and radiology images), fax, paper mail, CD mail, and in-person pickup. This breadth — particularly the inclusion of email submission and patient portal delivery — is a genuine strength for a physician practice.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness is required. In-person delivery is not mandated. Fees are mentioned but not quantified: "Medical record copy fees are determined by both the nature/purpose of your request and the format/method of delivery." This vagueness, combined with no distinction between patient-access and third-party-release fee structures, creates a risk of overcharging for Right of Access requests. The form also includes a broad liability waiver releasing OrthoCarolina from "any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure" — standard boilerplate but potentially intimidating.

## Overall Assessment

OrthoCarolina earns credit for easy form findability, multiple submission/delivery channels (including email and portal), and a reasonably organized single-page form. However, the lack of any dedicated patient access pathway, the absence of fillable fields in a 2023-vintage PDF, vague fee language, and the liability waiver embedded in a records request form collectively pull the assessment down. The organization treats patient self-access as undifferentiated from third-party release, missing an opportunity to acknowledge and streamline the exercise of a fundamental HIPAA right. The result is a serviceable but uninspired experience that a patient can navigate — but that was not designed with them in mind.

# Sea Mar Community Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Sea Mar Community Health Centers is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Seattle, WA. The organization publishes a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — that serves as the only downloadable pathway for patients requesting their own records. Sea Mar also offers a patient portal (MyChart) at seamar.org/ohr/index.php, though this was not evaluated as part of the form retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Sea Mar does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios — transfer of care, third-party release, and patient-initiated requests alike. The "Purpose of the release" section includes "At my request" as one option alongside "Transfer of Care" and "Verbal Disclosure," but there is no separate patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no mention of the specific protections that apply to individual access requests (fee limits, format choice, 30-day timeline). A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form that treats their legally-distinct right as just another checkbox on a general authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned a direct link to the PDF on the first attempt, and a site-scoped search confirmed no other ROI forms exist. There was no bot blocking, login wall, or CAPTCHA. The URL (`seamar.org/dl/ROI%20COPY%202022%20PDF.pdf`) uses the acronym "ROI" which patients are unlikely to recognize, but the form was immediately discoverable through search engines. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations make their forms far harder to find.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page PDF with a text layer (not a scanned image), but it has **zero fillable fields**. All entries use underscores and blank lines designed for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and return it — there are no interactive checkboxes, text inputs, or digital signature fields. The form cannot be completed digitally without third-party PDF annotation tools.

The layout is structured with labeled sections on the left side (Patient Information, From, To, Information to be released, etc.) following a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the single-page compression creates density issues with minimal whitespace. The language mixes plain directions with legal terminology — the reference to "Title 42 of the United States code" is imprecise (it should cite 42 CFR Part 2 specifically) and provides no actionable information to patients.

The instruction "Please initial one section" under record types is confusing — there are actually six initialing options, some of which patients might logically want to combine. The "All records" option excludes sensitive information without clearly cross-referencing the separate sensitive information section below, creating a two-step requirement that patients could easily miss.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is the **apparent requirement for in-person submission**. The form lists delivery methods for receiving records (In-Clinic, Verbal, CD, Paper, Fax) but provides no mailing address, fax number, or email address for submitting the completed form. The "Staff Use Only" section — with checkboxes for "Verified all sections are complete" and staff initials — strongly implies the form is designed to be completed in-clinic, in front of staff. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeline is stated. The 90-day default expiration is reasonable for a third-party authorization but conceptually irrelevant for a patient access request, since the right of access is ongoing.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular record type options**: The "Recent summary of care" itemizes specific components (Medication List, Problem List, Progress Notes, Imaging, Immunizations, screening results), giving patients a clear picture of what they'll receive.
- **Minor consent section**: A well-structured section for minors ages 13–17 to authorize release of sensitive information, with age thresholds aligned to Washington State's mature minor doctrine.
- **Easy discoverability**: The form was found on the first search attempt with no access barriers.
- **Patient rights statement**: Present, though generic — covers revocation right and no-conditioning, but does not reference individual access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Sea Mar provides a functional but paper-centric, undifferentiated pathway for patient record access. The form is easy to find online but impossible to complete digitally, and the apparent in-person submission requirement creates a meaningful barrier. The conflation of patient self-access with third-party authorization means patients receive no information about their specific rights under HIPAA's Right of Access. For an FQHC serving diverse communities, the absence of a Spanish-language version and the lack of any digital workflow are notable gaps.

# CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital is a critical access hospital in Long Prairie, MN, part of the CentraCare regional health system based in St. Cloud. Long Prairie does not maintain its own facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it uses CentraCare's system-wide "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, available from a centralized medical records release page at centracare.com. Three documents were found: the main ROI authorization form, a companion instruction sheet, and a separate substance use disorder consent form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

CentraCare does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for all releases of information — to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the "Release Information From" and "Release Information To" fields, placing themselves in the "To" field — an unintuitive workflow for someone who simply wants a copy of their own chart. There is no separate patient access request form, no dedicated section for individual access, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

That said, the form does include a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Reason for Release," which normalizes patient self-requests and helps HIM staff route them appropriately. The companion instruction document (form-2) provides clear, section-by-section guidance written in second person, explaining not just *what* to fill in but *why* each field matters — an unusual and helpful touch.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms required moderate effort. Web searches converged on CentraCare's centralized patient resources page, which logically organizes the forms. However, a patient searching specifically for "Long Prairie Hospital medical records form" must recognize that Long Prairie uses system-wide CentraCare forms and navigate accordingly. Direct download via automated tools (`curl`) was blocked by bot protection, requiring browser-based retrieval — a concern for assistive technologies and non-standard browsers.

## Form Document Quality

The main authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, despite its digital origins, it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand, or use third-party PDF annotation tools. This is a significant gap for a regional health system. The form has approximately 15–20 fields across patient demographics, release from/to addresses, record type checkboxes, delivery method, reason for release, and signature/date.

The layout is clean and logically structured: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Information to be Released → Special Disclosure → Preferred Method → Reason → Authorization → Revocation. Page 2 provides a comprehensive directory of all CentraCare HIM offices organized by region with fax numbers, phone, mail addresses, and a shared email. The language is mostly accessible, though the revocation paragraph contains dense legalese that may confuse patients.

## Submission and Delivery

CentraCare offers strong submission and delivery options. Completed forms can be submitted by **email** (CCHROI@CentraCare.com), **fax**, or **mail** — email submission is prominently featured and works for all locations. Records can be delivered via paper, CD, encrypted email, or MyChart portal. This is a genuinely patient-friendly set of options, particularly the encrypted email and MyChart delivery channels.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person submission requirement. No fee information is disclosed on either the form or the instructions, though the instructions reference "who may be responsible for the cost of records" without specifying amounts. No response time commitment is stated. The anti-re-release clause ("I do not authorize re-release of this information to anyone") is embedded as non-optional boilerplate rather than a patient choice. The form-3 SUD consent is an image-only scan with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers — but this is a supplementary document, not the primary pathway.

## Overall Assessment

CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital provides a **functional but not patient-centered** records request process. The strong points are the multiple electronic submission channels (especially email), diverse delivery options (MyChart, encrypted email), the "Personal Use" reason checkbox, and the unusually helpful instruction document. The weaknesses are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the non-fillable form requiring print-and-handwrite, the absence of fee disclosure, and the lack of any patient rights information. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process was designed for third-party release and the patient must adapt to it. Grade: **B**.

# The Valley Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

The Valley Hospital is a nonprofit, independent community hospital in Paramus, NJ, operating under the Valley Health System umbrella alongside Valley Medical Group (VMG) and Valley Home Care. Four PDF authorization forms were found — two VMG versions (July 2023 and May 2023), one older hospital-specific form hosted on MRO Corp's site (last revised 2011), and one Valley Home Care form (April 2023). Critically, the hospital's medical records page now directs patients to an online records request tool with identity verification via driver's license photo, rather than linking to any downloadable PDF forms.

## Access Pathway Assessment

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is the **online records request tool** accessible from the medical records page at `valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`. This represents a meaningful shift toward patient-centered digital access — the identity verification via driver's license photo suggests a workflow specifically designed for the patient themselves, distinct from third-party release scenarios.

The PDF forms, by contrast, are all **generic HIPAA authorization forms** designed for release of information to any recipient. None is a dedicated patient access form. The most current form (form-1, VMG, July 2023) accommodates patient self-access through instructions that say "If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF'" — functional but clearly an afterthought within a third-party disclosure framework. The four forms create a confusing landscape: a patient of The Valley Hospital proper might not realize the VMG form is what they need for ambulatory records, while a separate home care form exists for Valley Home Care patients. No guidance on the website explains which form applies to which entity.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the online records request tool is straightforward — the medical records page sits at a logical URL in the patient resources section. Finding the PDF forms, however, requires search engine assistance. The medical records page no longer links to any downloadable PDFs. The forms remain hosted at their original URLs on valleyhealth.com (and on mrocorp.com for the older hospital form) but are effectively orphaned. A patient who specifically wants a PDF form would need to search externally — not an unreasonable ask, but not ideal either.

## Form Document Quality

The best PDF form (form-1, VMG July 2023) is a well-structured 2-page document with a clear Section A/Section B organization and a full second page of step-by-step instructions with practical examples. The instructions are genuinely helpful — explaining how to designate self-access, offering example expiration events, and warning about unencrypted email risks. However, **none of the four forms has any fillable/interactive PDF fields** (all have `fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being born-digital documents with clean text layers, they are designed purely for print-and-fill workflow. The form offers five delivery methods — fax, paper copy, CD, unencrypted email, and encrypted email — a strong set of options. The encrypted email option is a positive differentiator.

The language is mixed: the instructions page uses plain language, but the sensitive information consent section is dense. The form's handling of sensitive categories (HIV, mental health, substance use, reproductive health) includes important NJ-specific protections but is complex enough to confuse lay readers. Approximately 20–25 fields must be completed, which is reasonable for a records authorization.

## Barriers

**Misleading "entire record" checkbox**: Checking "Entire medical record" on form-1 will *exclude* Behavioral Health Specialist and Substance Use Specialist records unless those boxes are also separately checked. This is the most significant red flag — a patient checking "entire record" would reasonably expect completeness.

**Fee ambiguity**: Form-1 states "there may be a fee" based on page count but discloses no amounts. The older hospital form (form-3) explicitly states a $1/page fee for personal use, which may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access. Fees are processed through MRO Disclosure Management Solutions, a third-party vendor.

**No form submission instructions**: Form-1 tells patients what to fill out but never specifies where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email for submission. Only the revocation address is provided.

**No notarization or witness required** on the primary form (form-1), though the older hospital form (form-3) includes a witness line.

## Bright Spots

- **Online portal transition**: The org has moved its primary pathway to a digital records request tool, significantly improving access over PDF-only workflows.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: Offering encrypted email alongside standard options demonstrates privacy awareness.
- **Comprehensive instructions**: The full-page plain-language instruction sheet with practical examples is among the better guidance we've seen.
- **Five delivery methods**: Fax, paper, CD, encrypted email, and unencrypted email give patients meaningful choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

The Valley Hospital earns a **B grade** primarily because of its transition to an online records request portal, which places it ahead of organizations still relying solely on paper forms. The PDF forms themselves are adequate but generic — they serve third-party release as the primary use case and accommodate patient self-access as a secondary scenario. The absence of fillable fields on all four PDFs is a missed opportunity for born-digital documents. The misleading "entire record" exclusion and fee ambiguity are notable compliance concerns, though neither rises to the level of an active barrier to access. The organization's investment in an online portal signals a patient-centered direction, even as its legacy PDF forms lag behind.

# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore is part of the Hillcrest HealthCare System (Ardent Health Services), and all medical records requests are handled through the parent system's centralized infrastructure. Two PDFs were downloaded during research, but only one is relevant: **form-2.pdf** is the system-wide "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (HMC1072, Rev. 08/18), which lists Hillcrest Hospital Claremore among nine facilities via checkboxes. Form-1.pdf belongs to an entirely unrelated practice — Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego, CA — and was a false-positive search result retained per study protocol.

Beyond the paper form, the system's Medical Records Request page advertises two digital pathways: **MyChart** (patient portal) and a **Swellbox** online request wizard (hosted at swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html). The paper form is thus the weakest of three available channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** clearly differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The paper form is a generic HIPAA authorization covering both disclosure *to* and receipt *from* third parties in a single document. It includes "At the request of the patient or patient's representative" as one purpose checkbox among Insurance, Continued treatment, Legal, and Other — framing patient access as merely one use case rather than a distinct right. The form makes no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

However, the availability of the Swellbox online wizard suggests the system may have a more patient-centric digital pathway. The paper form alone is clearly designed for the traditional release-of-information workflow, not individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search led directly to the system-wide Medical Records Request page at hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/, reachable in 2–3 clicks from the main website. The page clearly presents multiple pathways (MyChart, Swellbox, paper form). One minor friction point: direct searches for "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" specifically did not surface the form — a patient must navigate through or discover the parent system's centralized page.

## Form Document Quality

The paper form (form-2.pdf) is a **digitally created PDF with zero fillable fields**, forcing patients to print and handwrite all entries. This is a missed opportunity — the form was created digitally but not made interactive. The document is effectively one page of content duplicated as a carbon-copy format (page 1 for the facility, page 2 for the patient), a vestige of physical paper workflows.

The layout follows a logical flow: facility selection → patient identification → authorization body → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. However, the "I understand" section is a dense block of legalistic text with minimal visual separation. Record type options are clinically specific (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, etc.) with no "all records" or "entire medical record" checkbox. The checkbox characters extract as Khmer script (U+17A2), indicating a font-mapping issue that breaks assistive technology.

The language is **moderately legalistic**, particularly the sensitive-information acknowledgment paragraph, which is a single run-on sentence listing communicable diseases.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release the entities listed above, their agents and employees from any liability" as a condition of authorizing disclosure — not required by HIPAA and a red flag.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Normal applicable fees, such as copy fees, may apply" with no schedule or estimate.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no mailing address, fax number, or other submission method — patients must figure out delivery independently.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Patients cannot authorize general records release while excluding mental health, HIV, or substance abuse information.
- **No notarization** or witness requirement — a positive.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple request pathways**: The system offers MyChart, Swellbox online wizard, and a paper form — patients have choices.
- **System-wide form clarity**: The facility checkbox design clearly identifies which entities are covered, preventing confusion about facility-specific forms.
- **Easy findability**: The centralized Medical Records Request page is well-organized and accessible.

## Overall Assessment

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore benefits from its parent system's multi-channel approach to records requests, with digital options (MyChart and Swellbox) supplementing the paper form. However, the paper form itself — the only downloadable document — is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, legalistic language, and a problematic liability waiver. The organization earns credit for pathway availability and findability, but the form document quality and lack of patient access differentiation hold it back. A patient who only finds the paper form faces a distinctly paper-era experience; a patient who discovers the online pathways has a better route. Overall: **adequate infrastructure, mediocre form document, no patient-access differentiation**.

# NorthLakes Community Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NorthLakes Community Clinic is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Ashland, Wisconsin. The organization publishes two Release of Information forms on its website, both generic HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 authorization forms that serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party transfers, legal, disability, and more. There is no dedicated patient access pathway distinct from third-party authorization.

## Forms & Pathways

Two PDF forms are publicly available from the medical records page (https://nlccwi.org/for-our-patients/medical-records/):

- **form-1.pdf** ("Release of Information," 12/2023): The newer, current form. One page, numbered sections (1–6), with clear "Release FROM" / "Release TO" fields, granular record-type checkboxes, and explicit fax submission instructions (715-318-5644). However, it has **zero fillable fields** — a patient must print and hand-fill it. It does offer an encrypted email delivery option for receiving records.

- **form-2.pdf** ("Health Information Release," 4/2022): The older form with **54 fillable PDF fields**, intentionally designed for digital completion (the filename includes "Fillable"). But it lacks any submission instructions — no fax number, no mailing address, no email. A patient who fills it out digitally has no idea where to send it.

Both share the same internal registration number (REG-002), suggesting form-1 was meant to supersede form-2, yet both remain available with no guidance on which to use. The organization appears to have regressed in digital accessibility: the newer form removed fillable fields while adding better submission instructions and an encrypted email delivery option.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

NorthLakes does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms use the same "Release FROM" / "Release TO" structure designed for inter-organizational transfers. A patient requesting their own records must place NorthLakes in the "FROM" field and themselves in the "TO" field — workable but not intuitive. Positively, both forms include a "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox, explicitly acknowledging patient-directed requests as a valid use case. Neither form references HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) by name.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A simple web search immediately returned both PDF URLs. The organization's website hosts them as direct links under a clearly labeled medical records section. No bot blocking, login, or JavaScript rendering was required. Retrieval difficulty: **Easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Assessed using the high-watermark principle across both forms:

- **Fillability**: The older form-2 is genuinely fillable with 54 interactive fields. The current form-1 is not. A patient aware of both could use form-2 for digital completion, but the org steers toward form-1.
- **Layout**: Both forms use numbered sections with reasonable logical flow (patient info → directionality → purpose → record types → consent/signature). However, both cram everything onto a single dense page. Form-2's purpose and record-type sections are visually interleaved in a confusing two-column layout.
- **Language**: Consent paragraphs lean toward dense legalese, particularly on form-2 where a long unbroken paragraph covers treatment conditioning, re-disclosure, 42 CFR Part 2, Wisconsin DHS regulations, and revocation rights with no visual breaks. Form-1 improves on this with bulleted "I understand that..." statements.
- **Record selection**: Unusually granular. Both forms separate Mental Health, Substance Use Treatment, and Psychiatry records into distinct categories with individual checkboxes — giving patients fine-grained control over sensitive disclosures.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness required. No in-person submission requirement. Fax submission is explicitly available (form-1). No fees are mentioned — neither disclosed as free nor quantified. No response time is stated, though form-1 provides an urgent fax line for requests "requiring a response within a week." The confusing citation of "Federal Privacy Law (42 CFR Part 2) (HIPAA)" incorrectly implies 42 CFR Part 2 is part of HIPAA, which could mislead patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Encrypted email delivery option for records (form-1)
- "Self/Personal" purpose checkbox on both forms
- Granular behavioral health record type selection
- Verbal revocation explicitly acknowledged (form-2)
- Clear treatment non-conditioning language
- Fillable PDF exists (form-2), showing digital investment capability

## Overall Assessment

NorthLakes Community Clinic provides a functional but unrefined patient access experience. The forms are easy to find, free of major barriers, and offer good record-type granularity. However, the organization funnels all patients through a generic ROI authorization designed for third-party transfers, with no dedicated patient access pathway. The regression from a fillable to a non-fillable primary form is a notable step backward. A patient can get their records, but the process was not designed with them as the primary audience. **Grade: C (3.35/5.0).**

# Coast Plaza Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Coast Plaza Hospital provides two versions of the same "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form on its Medical Records page (`/for-patients/medical-records/`). Form-1 (June 2024, labeled "FINAL") is the current version; form-2 (January 2022) remains publicly accessible alongside it with no indication of which is current. Both are general-purpose ROI authorization forms — not patient-access-specific documents. The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is to download form-1, print and hand-fill it, and fax or mail it to the hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Coast Plaza Hospital does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Both forms use a single "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" workflow. The "Information to be Released to" section asks for "Name of Hospital/Clinic/Physician/Person," framing the recipient as a third party. A patient requesting their own records must write their own name in this field, which is unintuitive. While "Personal Use" appears as a purpose option and "Records for Personal Use" as a record-type checkbox, the relationship between these is ambiguous — it's unclear whether selecting one, the other, or both is needed. The form lacks any Right of Access language or statement of patient rights beyond standard authorization boilerplate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Multiple search strategies succeeded: a filetype:pdf web search and a site-scoped search both led to the hospital's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering was required. Both PDFs downloaded directly with curl. The only findability concern is the co-existence of two versions without clear versioning — a patient could easily download the outdated 2022 form, which lists a different fax number that may no longer be monitored.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-created 2-page PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. All ~20+ data entry points (patient name, address, DOB, phone, email, recipient information, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, date range, delivery method, signature) must be completed by hand after printing. The layout is well-organized with bold section headers ("Patient Information," "Information to be Released From," etc.) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. Record types are arranged efficiently in two columns with 16+ individual categories. The language is moderately legalistic — first-person authorization statements are standard but dense. A "PATIENT LABEL" box on both pages is a clinical workflow artifact that may confuse patients completing the form at home.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No fillable fields**: Forces a fully paper-based completion workflow in a form that was digitally designed and could easily support interactive fields.
- **CD-only electronic delivery**: The only electronic format option is CD — functionally obsolete in 2024. No email, portal, or secure download option exists.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "I understand that there may be a fee associated with this request" provides no fee amounts or reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee standard, potentially chilling patient requests.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not tell patients where to send the completed authorization. The hospital's fax number appears in the "Released From" section but is not framed as a return destination.
- **Outdated form still online**: The 2022 version with a different fax number remains downloadable, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record selection**: 16+ specific record types give patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **Sensitive category separation**: Mental Health, Genetic Testing, Alcohol/Drug Abuse, and HIV/AIDS records require separate initialing — correctly implementing federal and state requirements.
- **Encryption preference**: The form asks whether patients want records encrypted, a privacy-conscious option rarely seen on ROI forms.
- **No notarization or witness required**: The form requires only the patient's signature.

## Overall Assessment

Coast Plaza Hospital provides a findable, reasonably organized generic ROI form that a patient *can* use for self-access, but the experience is clearly not designed around patient needs. The lack of fillable fields, absence of submission instructions, CD-only electronic delivery, and generic third-party framing all reflect a process built for institutional convenience rather than patient empowerment. The form earns credit for easy findability, granular record selection, and proper handling of sensitive categories, but falls short on technical accessibility and patient-centeredness.

# Erie Family Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erie Family Health Centers, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Chicago, provides two downloaded ROI forms: an English version (form-1.pdf) and a Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are identical in structure — a single-page "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form. The organization also directs patients to MyChart (myeriehealth.com) as the primary records access pathway, referenced on a dedicated medical records request page at `/recordsrequest/`.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Erie does **not** offer a dedicated patient-access form. Both downloaded forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for bidirectional use: releasing records *to* a third party or receiving records *from* a third party. A patient requesting their own records must select "to Release to" and write their own name and address in the recipient fields — a process designed for inter-provider transfers, not individual access. The form includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under the purpose section, which accommodates self-requests but does not differentiate the pathway. There is no separate, simplified form for patients exercising their Right of Access under § 164.524.

That said, the records request page promotes MyChart as the primary way to access records, which provides a true patient-access pathway. The PDF form functions as a secondary or fallback option.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search for "Erie Family Health Centers medical records release form PDF" returned the direct URL. The organization maintains a clearly labeled `/recordsrequest/` page that links both English and Spanish PDFs and also promotes MyChart. No bot blocking, login walls, or access barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with **54 fillable fields**. It was designed for digital completion, not a scan. However, field names are not programmatically labeled (empty `fillable_field_names` array), which impairs screen reader accessibility. The layout is logically organized — patient identification, authorization direction, purpose, format, delivery method, record types, date range, sensitive-category permissions, rights statement, and signature — all on one dense page.

The language is reasonably clear for an authorization form, though the legal disclaimers at the bottom (addressing re-disclosure restrictions under Illinois mental health, substance abuse, and AIDS confidentiality laws) are dense and directed at the receiving party rather than the patient. The reference to "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" is cryptic — no pay scale is provided or linked, leaving patients uninformed about potential costs.

Format options include paper copy or "Electronic copy (CD-ROM)" — the CD-ROM reference is outdated. Delivery methods include encrypted email, pickup at an Erie facility, fax, and US postal mail. Encrypted email is a notable modern inclusion.

## Barriers

- **Copy of ID required** as a blanket requirement, with no alternative verification methods offered. For an FQHC serving populations that may lack government-issued ID, this exceeds what HIPAA mandates for identity verification.
- **Witness signature line** present with no indication of whether it is required or optional, potentially creating an unnecessary procedural barrier.
- **Fee opacity**: "Please refer to Pay Scale for rates" references an undisclosed fee schedule. Patients cannot learn costs before submitting.
- **No notarization** required. No in-person submission requirement. Auto-expiration at six months is reasonable.

## Bright Spots

- **Bilingual forms**: Both English and Spanish versions are provided and linked side-by-side — appropriate and commendable for a Chicago FQHC.
- **Encrypted email delivery**: A modern, patient-friendly option that many organizations omit.
- **Dedicated records request page**: Clear `/recordsrequest/` page contextualizes forms and promotes MyChart as an alternative.
- **Granular record selection**: Nine specific record categories plus "Other" let patients request exactly what they need.
- **MyChart availability**: The patient portal provides a true digital-first access pathway beyond the PDF form.

## Overall Assessment

Erie Family Health Centers earns a **B grade** (3.70 weighted score). The organization makes its forms easy to find, offers bilingual versions, provides a fillable PDF with modern delivery options including encrypted email, and maintains a dedicated records page. These are genuine strengths, especially for an independent FQHC. However, the lack of a dedicated patient-access pathway (funneling all requestors through a generic third-party authorization form), the undisclosed fee schedule, the blanket ID copy requirement, and the ambiguous witness signature line prevent a higher score. The MyChart portal partially compensates by offering patients a true self-service pathway, but the PDF form itself — the focus of this evaluation — treats patient self-access as just another use case rather than a first-class right.

# SSM Health DePaul Hospital - St. Louis: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health DePaul Hospital in Bridgeton, MO is part of the SSM Health system, a major nonprofit health system operating across the Midwest. The hospital does not maintain its own medical records request forms; instead, it relies on SSM Health's system-wide forms. Two versions were found: an older system-wide form (form-1, "SSMHC" branding, dated 1/2019) and a current St. Louis metro–specific form (form-2, "SSM Health" branding). Form-2 is the applicable document for DePaul Hospital patients. Additionally, SSM Health's medical records page references an electronic request option through the **MRO Express portal** (mroexpress.mrocorp.com) for Missouri facilities.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Both forms are dual-purpose documents titled "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," combining individual access requests and third-party disclosure authorizations into a single instrument. A patient requesting their own records must navigate structure designed for third-party releases — including a "disclose my protected health information to" recipient block with name, address, fax, and relationship fields. The "For personal access" option exists only as a checkbox buried under the "Purpose of Disclosure" section, alongside options like "Insurance/Workers' Compensation" and "Legal."

This dual-purpose design means patients must determine which fields to fill, which to skip, and how to route a form that assumes a releasing-to and releasing-from party. While technically functional, it is not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required moderate effort. The SSM Health medical records page (ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records) uses location-dependent content loading to surface region-specific forms, but the location selector's autocomplete reportedly failed during testing. Starting from DePaul Hospital's location page, the "Get Medical Records" link redirects to the system-wide page without directly linking the St. Louis metro form. A web search for SSM Health medical records forms did surface both PDFs, and the form-2 URL is descriptively structured. Overall, a patient would need 3+ clicks and some navigation persistence.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 — the relevant document — is a **single-page fillable PDF with 69 interactive fields**, representing a genuine digital-first design. Patients can complete the entire form electronically in any PDF viewer without printing. This is a clear strength. The form includes fields for patient demographics, type of access (inspection, hard copy, electronic copy), record type checkboxes with date fields (including sensitive categories like substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV-related information), purpose of disclosure, and a seven-item acknowledgement section covering HIPAA rights.

However, the language is **legalistic** throughout. The acknowledgement section contains seven dense paragraphs written in formal legal register. There are no separate instructions, no plain-language summary, and no guidance helping patients understand which fields apply to their situation. The single-page constraint results in compressed formatting and small text in the acknowledgement section. The form is English-only.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and **no in-person submission mandate**. Fees are disclosed as possible ("I may be required to pay the cost of creating paper copies or electronic media") but without specific amounts and with a TPO exception carve-out. A 30-day response time is committed, and the right to request review of access denials is clearly stated. Revocation rights and non-conditioning of care are explicitly covered.

The most notable concern is the **email delivery warning**: SSM Health states that encrypted email is "the only way to avoid third party interception" and frames unencrypted email delivery as a risky exception requiring patient acknowledgement. While email delivery is technically offered (form-2 includes an email field), the discouraging language may deter patients from choosing electronic delivery. An expiration date field — with research-oriented options — is misplaced for patient access requests and may confuse non-research requestors.

## Notable Strengths

- **69 fillable form fields** on a single page — genuinely fillable, not a flat scan
- **Email delivery option** with explicit email address field (form-2 improvement over form-1)
- **Granular record type selection** with sensitive-category breakouts for substance abuse, psychotherapy notes, and HIV
- **MRO Express portal** as an alternative electronic request pathway
- **Clear rights statements** covering 30-day timeline, denial review, and revocation

## Key Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as insurance companies and attorneys
- **Legalistic language** with no plain-language guidance or instructions
- **Email delivery framed as risky exception** rather than standard option
- **English-only** — no multilingual support
- **Expiration date field** inappropriate for patient access requests

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health DePaul Hospital earns a **C grade**. The fillable PDF form and MRO Express portal provide adequate technical infrastructure, and the form covers HIPAA compliance basics without imposing illegitimate barriers. However, the failure to distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, combined with dense legal language and no patient-facing guidance, means a patient must work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights. The org meets minimum requirements but falls short of patient-centered design.
