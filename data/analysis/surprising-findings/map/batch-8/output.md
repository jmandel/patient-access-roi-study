# Surprising Findings — Batch 8

## The DocuSign Paradox: Digital Submission Masking a Fundamentally Wrong Form

**Esse Health**, a 100+ physician independent for-profit practice in St. Louis, offers a DocuSign-based electronic submission pathway for its ROI form — a genuine technical achievement that most organizations in this study lack. Yet the form patients submit through that polished digital pipeline is a generic third-party authorization with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED BY" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields. A patient requesting their own records must fill in themselves as both the requester and the recipient, with zero guidance on how to do so. The organization invested in modernizing the *delivery mechanism* (DocuSign) without ever reconsidering the *content* being delivered. This is a form designed for attorneys and insurance companies, wrapped in a patient-friendly digital experience. It's a striking example of how technical sophistication and patient-centeredness can be completely decoupled — the organization solved the wrong problem elegantly.

Adding to the irony: the PDF version of this same form reports 28 fillable field annotations in its metadata, but the field names array is empty, meaning the fields are non-functional. Someone at some point attempted to make the form interactive and either failed or abandoned the effort. The DocuSign pathway papers over this broken PDF, but a patient who downloads the form directly gets a document that *looks* fillable but isn't.

## The 31-Step Records Request

**Gastro Florida**, a 50+ provider independent gastroenterology practice in Clearwater, FL, has gone fully portal-based for records requests through Sharecare/HDS — no downloadable form exists at all. This is architecturally a forward-looking choice: dedicated digital pathway, clear separation of patient self-access from third-party release, no printing or mailing required. But the portal requires approximately 31 steps to complete, including uploading a government-issued photo ID. For comparison, most paper ROI forms in this study have 10–20 fields. The organization has traded one set of barriers (paper, fax, in-person delivery) for another (digital complexity, ID requirements that exclude undocumented patients, and a workflow longer than filling out a tax return).

The surrounding patient experience amplifies the problem. Gastro Florida's dedicated "Medical Records" page at gastrofl.com/medical-records/ is *completely empty* — a heading with no content. The functional portal link is buried on the Patient Forms page alongside intake paperwork. A patient who follows the most intuitive path ("I need my medical records" → navigates to Medical Records page) hits a dead end. Meanwhile, the organization's 2026 Notice of Privacy Practices contains an unresolved "ClientName" template placeholder where "Gastro Florida" should appear — a vendor template published without customization, suggesting nobody at the practice actually read the document before posting it.

## Two For-Profit Practices, One Shared Pattern

Both organizations in this batch are independent, for-profit physician practices — Esse Health in the Midwest and Gastro Florida in the South. Despite different specialties, sizes, and geographies, they share a striking pattern: both have invested in genuinely modern digital infrastructure (DocuSign; Sharecare portal) while neglecting the patient-facing content and navigation that would make that infrastructure useful. Both score well on *technical accessibility* (4 and 5 respectively) but mediocre on *content design* (both 3). This suggests that for independent practices, the decision to adopt digital tools is driven by operational efficiency (reducing paper handling, fax volume, staff processing time) rather than patient experience. The technology serves the practice first and the patient incidentally.

This "good pipes, bad content" pattern may be characteristic of the for-profit independent practice segment. These organizations are large enough to invest in technology but lack the compliance infrastructure of major health systems that would flag issues like generic authorization forms or empty web pages. The result is a modernized veneer over unreformed processes.

## The Consent Bundling Problem

Gastro Florida's intake form bundles six unrelated authorizations under a single signature — treatment consent, promotional use of patient survey comments, and portal enrollment — with language stating the practice "has the right to refuse to treat you if you refuse to sign this consent." While not directly a records access issue, this coercive consent bundling reveals an organizational posture toward patient autonomy that contextualizes the records access experience. An organization that conditions treatment on signing a promotional-use waiver is unlikely to have deeply considered what patient-centered records access looks like.
