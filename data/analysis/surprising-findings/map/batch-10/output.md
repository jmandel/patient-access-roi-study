# Surprising Findings — Batch 10

## The For-Profit Paradox: HCA and CHS Outperform Prestigious Nonprofits

The single A-grade organization in the entire study is **Flowers Hospital** (Dothan, AL) — a for-profit community hospital owned by Community Health Systems (CHS). Its "Patient Request for Health Information" form has 66 fillable fields, co-equal Spanish translation, a Swellbox portal alternative, and lists "Myself" as the first recipient option. Meanwhile, **UCSF Medical Center** — one of the nation's most prestigious academic medical centers — uses a generic third-party authorization form where patients must awkwardly list themselves as the recipient. UCSF's form even contains a typo ("specifcally") in both English versions and spelling errors in its Spanish translation. The pattern extends: both CHS hospitals in the sample (Flowers and **Merit Health Central**) offer dedicated patient access forms, while teaching hospitals like **UPMC Presbyterian** (C grade, 2.9) and **UMMC** (C grade, 2.85) lag behind. For-profit hospital chains appear to have standardized patient-centered form templates across their networks, while elite nonprofits treat form design as an afterthought.

## Safety-Net Providers Have the Worst Digital Access

Four of five F-grade organizations are FQHCs — the community health centers designed to serve vulnerable populations. **Aaron E. Henry CHC** (Mississippi), **Franklin Primary Health Center** (Alabama), **Peoples Health Centers** (Missouri), and **El Rio Health** (Arizona) all offer phone-or-in-person-only access with no downloadable forms whatsoever. These are organizations whose patients disproportionately face transportation barriers, inflexible work schedules, and limited phone access — yet they're the ones requiring patients to call or visit in person. The irony is sharp: the safety net offers the least accessible records request process. Only 8% of FQHCs have a dedicated patient access pathway, compared to 33% of teaching hospitals.

## System Acquisitions Create Patient Access Black Holes

**Canton-Potsdam Hospital** (Potsdam, NY) illustrates a troubling pattern: health system mergers can leave patients worse off than before. After St. Lawrence Health was acquired by Rochester Regional Health, the original SLH website began redirecting — but CPH-specific content was never migrated. The parent system's Swellbox/Datavant online records portal *explicitly excludes* St. Lawrence Health facilities. The only pathway is calling a phone number. The sole recoverable forms came from the Wayback Machine. A patient today exists in a gap between two systems, belonging to neither. **Saratoga Hospital** shows a less extreme version of the same pattern: its original domain redirects to Albany Med Health System, and the legacy form has been replaced by a system-wide form that doesn't explain the transition.

## Witness Signatures: A Widespread Barrier Without Legal Basis

At least 31 organizations include a witness signature line on their ROI forms, despite HIPAA imposing no witness requirement for patient access or authorization. The impact varies: some merely include an ambiguous blank line (**Sturdy Memorial**, **Lakeland Regional**), while others explicitly require a witness (**Adventhealth Central Texas**, **Abbeville Area Medical Center** which requires *two* witnesses, **UMMC**). **Duly Health and Care** (Downers Grove, IL) takes the unusual step of conditionally requiring a witness — only when the request is for "Personal Reasons" rather than care transfer, effectively penalizing patient self-access. For patients completing forms at home, a witness requirement can mean the difference between submitting today and delaying indefinitely.

## SSN Collection Remains Disturbingly Pervasive

Forty-seven organizations — nearly a quarter of the sample — include a Social Security Number field on their ROI forms, creating unnecessary identity theft risk. SSN is not required by HIPAA for authorization. The practice cuts across all facility types but is especially concentrated among **physician practices** (9 of 26, including **Advocare**, **GI Alliance**, **The Iowa Clinic**) and **critical access hospitals** (7 of 29, including **Lane County Hospital** and **Nemaha Valley Community Hospital**). Even **Duke University Hospital** and **Barnes-Jewish Hospital** — two of the nation's top academic medical centers — collect SSN on their authorization forms. Canton-Potsdam Hospital's archived OCA-960 also includes SSN, reflecting a state-standardized form that bakes in the risk.

## One FQHC Gets It Right — And It's an HIV/AIDS Clinic

**Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers**, historically focused on HIV/AIDS care, is one of only two FQHCs with a dedicated patient access form — and one of only 22 organizations overall (12%) to offer one. FIGHT maintains separate forms for patient self-access ("Patient Request for Access to Information") and third-party authorization, offers email submission, and provides bilingual availability. The organization's sensitivity to its patient population's privacy needs appears to have driven best-practice form design. This stands in stark contrast to the FQHC average: most safety-net providers funnel all records requests through generic third-party release forms, if they offer any downloadable form at all.

## The USCDI Sighting and the Post-Dobbs Warning

Two forms contain features so unusual they deserve flagging. **Riverside Community Hospital** (HCA) includes a "USCDI release request" option — a reference to the United States Core Data for Interoperability standard — suggesting awareness of health IT interoperability that is virtually absent from the rest of the study. **UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital** includes a post-*Dobbs* reproductive healthcare warning (item 6) alerting patients that released reproductive health information could be used in litigation. Both represent organizations responding to emerging regulatory and technical landscapes in ways most providers have not yet considered.
