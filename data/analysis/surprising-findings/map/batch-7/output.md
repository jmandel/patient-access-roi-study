# Surprising Findings — Batch 7

## The Right of Access Form That Doesn't Support Self-Access

**The Baton Rouge Clinic** (independent for-profit physician practice, LA) demonstrates a uniquely ironic failure. The clinic created a three-form architecture — outbound release, inbound transfer, and a dedicated "Right of Access Form" explicitly citing HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 164.524. This is more structural differentiation than most organizations attempt. Yet the Right of Access form is framed entirely as a designee authorization, directing records "to: Name: ___" with no option for a patient to simply request their own records. The organization that came closest to getting the legal framework right still designed the form so the most common Right of Access use case — "I want my own records" — doesn't fit. It also has zero fillable fields and no submission instructions, so even a patient who figures out the workaround (writing their own name in the designee field) has no idea where to send the completed form.

## The Conditional-Sections Solution Nobody Else Found

**Ben Taub Hospital** (Harris Health System, government, Houston, TX) invented an elegant answer to the dual-purpose form problem that no other batch has surfaced. Rather than creating separate forms or forcing patients through a generic third-party process, Harris Health's authorization marks entire sections as "only required if the individual providing this authorization form is someone other than the patient." Patients can visually skip irrelevant fields. The email delivery option is labeled "Patients Only" — a two-word design choice that signals patient self-access is a recognized, first-class use case. This from a government safety-net hospital scoring 3.85 (B), defying the pattern that government facilities produce unsophisticated forms.

## 103 Fillable Fields, Two Photo IDs Required

**NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital** embodies a contradition: its Tripartite authorization form has 103 fillable fields (likely the highest count in the entire study), trilingual availability (English/Spanish/Chinese), a dedicated phone line (646-NYP-4ROI), and six delivery methods. This is digital-first excellence. Yet its Verisma portal requires *two* forms of photo ID — a requirement that exceeds typical HIPAA identity verification and could exclude patients who lack multiple government-issued photo IDs. The form also states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records" — language accurate for third-party authorization but misleading for patient access, where HIPAA requires only a written request. The most technically sophisticated form in this batch simultaneously imposes barriers its less sophisticated peers avoid.

## Natividad's Backwards Evolution

**Natividad Medical Center** (government, independent, Salinas, CA) produced a 2019 form that is *less* accessible than its 2007 predecessor. The newer form is a grayscale image-only scan with no text layer — invisible to screen readers, unsearchable, non-fillable. The older 2007 form at least has a text layer (though it's copy-protected). For a government hospital, this regression in digital accessibility may violate Section 508 requirements. The 2019 form also establishes CD as the sole electronic delivery format, stating it as organizational "policy." Both forms remain on the website with no indication of which is current.

## Community-Responsive Language Access Beyond English and Spanish

Two independent physician practices — **Olmsted Medical Center** (Rochester, MN) and **Prevea Health** (Green Bay, WI) — publish ROI forms in Somali, reflecting the specific refugee demographics of their communities. Prevea goes further with Hmong translations as well. These aren't large health systems with translation departments; they're mid-sized independent practices that invested in languages spoken by maybe 3-5% of their patient populations. This level of community-specific language access is vanishingly rare across the study, and it stands out because these organizations don't otherwise score exceptionally — Prevea earns a C (3.4), Olmsted a B (3.75). The multilingual effort is a standalone commitment to equity, not part of a broader excellence strategy.

## The Internal URL on a Patient-Facing Form

**Ben Taub Hospital's** form footer contains `apps.hchd.local` — an internal-network address inaccessible from the public internet. This is a small but telling artifact: the form was designed for internal HIM workflows and repurposed for patients without removing staff-facing references. Similarly, **Columbus Community Hospital's** (independent nonprofit, NE) form — dated 2014, now over 11 years old — carries footer text reading "Found in Policy Manager/Consent Forms" and "c: HIPAA Manual," page "42." These are filing instructions for document management staff, not patients. The forms were excerpted from internal policy binders and published online as-is, revealing that "patient-facing" often means "internal form we also gave to patients."

## The White-Label Records Request

**Southeast Medical Group** (independent for-profit, Alpharetta, GA) redirects patients from "Request Records" on its website to **medicopy.net/patients** — a third-party site with zero SEMG branding. A patient clicking the link lands on an unfamiliar domain and encounters a generic vendor form. The MediCopy form itself has genuine bright spots (plain-language headers, sensitive-record exclusion options, HelloSign digital alternative), but the trust gap is notable: patients may not believe they're in the right place. The form also lacks any submission instructions for the PDF version — a patient who downloads it instead of using HelloSign has no address, fax number, or email to send it to.

## Valleywise Health: The Government Hospital That Got It Right

**Valleywise Health** (government, independent, Phoenix, AZ) is a striking outlier among government-owned facilities. It maintains a dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information" form separate from its third-party authorization — a best practice that even some major academic medical centers fail to implement. The patient form omits purpose/reason fields, expiration clauses, and third-party recipient designations, correctly recognizing that these are irrelevant for self-access. It offers full bilingual English/Spanish translation (not a summary — a complete parallel document), 16+ granular record categories, and six delivery methods including MyChart, USB, and email. It scores 4.0 (B), the highest among government hospitals in this batch. The one blemish: its Spanish translation references a nonexistent "documento 43780" instead of the correct form number, potentially sending Spanish-speaking patients on a fruitless search.
