# Portal Landscape Analysis — Batch 6

## Overall Portal Adoption

Of 190 organizations with scored synthesis data, **94 (49.5%)** offer at least one online portal or patient portal pathway for requesting medical records. The remaining 96 rely exclusively on PDF forms combined with fax, mail, email, phone, or in-person submission. Among portal-equipped orgs, the portal is the **primary** pathway at 42 (22% of total) — meaning the organization directs patients to the portal first. At the remaining 52, the portal is a secondary option listed alongside a traditional PDF download.

## Vendor/Platform Landscape

Two platforms dominate, accounting for two-thirds of identified portal deployments:

| Vendor/Platform | Orgs | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **MyChart (Epic)** | 33 | General patient portal; usually secondary to PDF forms |
| **Swellbox/Datavant** | 29 | Purpose-built ROI request wizard; often the primary pathway |
| Other/Unidentified | 30 | Custom or unbranded portals |
| Sharecare/HDS | 4 | Third-party records platform |
| MRO Express | 3 | Third-party ROI fulfillment |
| ChartRequest | 2 | Account-required portal |
| athenahealth | 2 | EHR-integrated portal |
| Formstack | 2 | Online form builder |
| Verisma | 2 | Records management portal |
| JotForm | 2 | Online form builder |
| MediCopy/HelloSign | 2 | Electronic signature workflow |
| DocuSign, RightSignature, ScanSTAT, Ciox | 1 each | One-off solutions |

**MyChart** appears at 33 organizations but functions as the primary records request pathway at only 7 of them (e.g., Erie Family Health Centers, El Rio Health, NewYork-Presbyterian). At the remaining 26, MyChart is mentioned as an option — "you can also request records through MyChart" — while the primary workflow remains a downloadable PDF authorization form. This reflects MyChart's role as a general-purpose patient portal: it supports records access but doesn't replace the formal ROI authorization process.

**Swellbox/Datavant** appears at 29 organizations and is far more likely to be the primary pathway — 20 of 29 Swellbox orgs position it as the primary request mechanism. This reflects its specialization: Swellbox is a purpose-built records-request wizard with identity verification and electronic authorization, deployed primarily across large health systems (Ascension, AdventHealth, HCA, Bon Secours Mercy, Piedmont). Its adoption pattern suggests enterprise-level procurement decisions rather than facility-level choices.

## PDF Coexistence

When a portal exists, **85% (80 of 94) still offer a downloadable PDF form** alongside it. Only **14 organizations are portal-only** with no PDF available. Portal-only orgs skew toward FQHCs (7 of 14, including Aaron E. Henry CHC, El Rio Health, La Clínica de La Raza, HopeHealth, Peoples Health Centers, Franklin Primary Health Center, and East Georgia Healthcare Center). Several of these portal-only FQHCs present an accessibility concern: patients without portal accounts may have no clear public-facing pathway to request records. The remaining portal-only orgs include two community hospitals (AdventHealth Hendersonville, Kings Daughters Medical Center Brookhaven), two physician practices (Gastro Florida, The Iowa Clinic), and one critical access hospital (Minnie Hamilton Health System).

## Patterns by Organization Type

**Facility type**: Physician practices (58%) and FQHCs (56%) lead portal adoption, followed by community hospitals (54%) and teaching hospitals (47%). **Critical access hospitals lag significantly at 28%** — only 8 of 29 CAHs mention any portal pathway. This likely reflects resource constraints: portal deployments require vendor contracts, IT infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance that small rural facilities may not prioritize.

**Ownership**: For-profit organizations lead at 61%, nonprofits at 50%, and **government hospitals trail at just 25%** (6 of 24). Government facilities disproportionately rely on paper-based fax-and-mail workflows.

**System affiliation**: Major-system hospitals adopt portals at 55% vs. 45% for independents, with regional systems at 50%. The Swellbox data illustrates why: 18 of 29 Swellbox deployments are at major-system hospitals (Ascension, HCA, Piedmont, Mercy Health), suggesting centralized procurement.

**Region**: The West leads at 51%, followed by the South at 55%, with the Midwest (43%) and Northeast (44%) slightly behind. Regional differences are modest compared to the facility-type and ownership gaps.

## Key Takeaway

The portal landscape is split almost exactly in half: 49.5% of organizations offer some online pathway. But portal presence does not equal portal primacy — only 22% of all orgs make a portal the first-choice pathway. The market is dominated by two platforms with very different profiles: MyChart as a ubiquitous-but-secondary patient portal, and Swellbox/Datavant as a specialized-and-often-primary ROI tool. The most vulnerable gap is among government hospitals and critical access hospitals, where portals remain rare and patients face exclusively paper-based workflows.
