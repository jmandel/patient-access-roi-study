# Portal Landscape: Batch Analysis

## Overview

Across 190 organizations with scored synthesis data, **94 (49%)** offer at least one online portal or patient portal pathway for medical records requests. However, portals are the **primary** pathway at only 19 organizations (10%) — at the remaining 75, the portal sits alongside (and usually behind) a traditional PDF form. The portal landscape is dominated by two platforms — Epic MyChart and Swellbox/Datavant — which together account for nearly two-thirds of all portal-equipped organizations.

## Portal Adoption Rates

| Category | Portal Rate |
|----------|------------|
| **Overall** | 94/190 (49%) |
| For-profit | 25/41 (61%) |
| FQHC | 14/25 (56%) |
| Physician practice | 15/26 (58%) |
| Community hospital | 43/80 (54%) |
| Teaching hospital | 14/30 (47%) |
| Critical access hospital | 8/29 (28%) |
| Government-owned | 6/24 (25%) |

For-profit organizations lead adoption at 61%, likely driven by HCA facilities (MyHealthONE portal) and system-affiliated hospitals using Swellbox. Critical access hospitals and government-owned facilities trail significantly — the smallest and most resource-constrained organizations are least likely to offer a digital pathway. Major-system-affiliated organizations (55%) outpace independents (45%), consistent with systems deploying portals at scale across member facilities.

## Vendor Landscape

Two platforms dominate:

- **Epic MyChart** — 33 orgs (35% of portal orgs). Spans every facility type: teaching hospitals (Duke, Yale New Haven, UCSF), community hospitals (Baptist Health Lexington, Saratoga Hospital), and FQHCs (El Rio Health, La Clínica de La Raza via OCHIN). MyChart functions as a full patient portal with records requests embedded within a broader clinical relationship.

- **Swellbox/Datavant** — 29 orgs (31%). A dedicated records-request wizard, not a general patient portal. Heavily used by HCA (MountainView, Riverside Community, TriStar Centennial), Ascension (Sacred Heart, Saint Thomas Rutherford), and Bon Secours Mercy Health. Also adopted by independents like King's Daughters Medical Center and Lakeland Regional Health. Swellbox is the most common *primary* portal pathway — when an org lists Swellbox as its main request channel, it typically replaces the PDF form rather than supplementing it.

The long tail includes **Sharecare/HDS** (4 orgs), **MRO** (3 orgs), **MyHealthONE/HCA** (3), **ChartRequest** (2), **Verisma** (2), and one-offs like DocuSign, JotForm, Zoho, and Formstack — organizations that built custom digital workflows using general-purpose form tools rather than healthcare-specific platforms.

## PDF Coexistence

When a portal exists, a PDF form almost always remains available alongside it:

- **Portal + PDF**: 80 orgs (85% of portal orgs)
- **Portal only (no PDF)**: 14 orgs (15%)

Portal-only organizations include AdventHealth Hendersonville (Swellbox), Anaheim Global Medical Center (ChartRequest), several FQHCs using MyChart via OCHIN (El Rio, Franklin Primary, La Clínica de La Raza), and smaller facilities using custom online forms (Labette Health via Formstack, Riverwood Healthcare via JotForm). The PDF form is not going away — it is a fallback even at organizations that prominently promote their portal.

## Portal as Primary vs. Secondary

Among the 94 portal-equipped organizations:

- **Portal is primary pathway**: 42 orgs (45%)
- **Portal is secondary/supplementary**: 52 orgs (55%)

When the portal is secondary, it typically appears as a "you can also request records through your patient portal" note on a medical records page dominated by a downloadable PDF. When the portal is primary, the organization's records page leads with the portal link and may bury or omit the PDF alternative — Swellbox-powered sites particularly follow this pattern.

## Notable Patterns

**System affiliation drives vendor choice.** Ascension facilities use Swellbox. HCA facilities use both Swellbox and MyHealthONE. Bon Secours Mercy Health uses both Swellbox and MyChart. The choice is made at the system level and deployed uniformly, meaning a patient's portal experience depends more on which health system owns their hospital than on local decisions.

**FQHCs punch above their weight.** Despite limited resources, 56% of FQHCs offer a portal — often MyChart through the OCHIN collaborative (Franklin Primary, La Clínica de La Raza, Sea Mar). OCHIN effectively gives small community health centers the same portal infrastructure as academic medical centers.

**Self-access differentiation remains rare.** Only 20 of 94 portal-equipped orgs (21%) clearly differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting on someone else's behalf. Most portals funnel both use cases through the same workflow, which means patients exercising their HIPAA right of access encounter the same authorization complexity as third-party requestors — an unnecessary burden.

**Government facilities lag.** Only 25% of government-owned organizations offer any portal pathway, compared to 50%+ for nonprofit and for-profit facilities. This includes VA-adjacent facilities and public hospitals that may rely on in-person or mail-only workflows.
