# Portal & Online Request Landscape — Batch 2

## Summary Counts

Of 38 organizations in this batch, **11 (29%)** include some form of online portal or patient portal as a request pathway. The remaining 27 rely exclusively on PDF forms with fax/mail/email submission.

Portal presence breaks down into two categories:

- **Dedicated online request portals** (7 orgs): Third-party platforms that serve as the primary or secondary digital submission channel — Swellbox/Datavant (3), ChartRequest (1), DocuSign (1), ScanSTAT (1), Sharecare/HDS (1), Datavant standalone (1).
- **Patient portals mentioned as secondary options** (6 orgs): Epic MyChart (5) and Athena Health (1), typically listed as a delivery mechanism or alternative rather than a primary request pathway. Two orgs appear in both categories (Minnie Hamilton has both ChartRequest and Athena; Proliance has Datavant alongside other pathways).

## Vendor Landscape

**Swellbox/Datavant** is the dominant third-party records request vendor, appearing at 3 organizations: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford (TN), Arizona Community Physicians (AZ), and Penobscot Community Health Care (ME). In all three cases, the Swellbox wizard is the **primary** pathway, with PDF forms relegated to secondary status.

**Epic MyChart** appears at 5 organizations (Aurora Medical Center–Grafton, Owensboro Health, Guthrie Corning, Myrtue Medical Center, Banner–University Medical Center Phoenix) but always as a **secondary** option — typically for record delivery rather than request initiation. None make MyChart the primary request channel.

Other vendors appear once each: **ChartRequest** (Minnie Hamilton Health System), **DocuSign** (Esse Health), **ScanSTAT** (West Tennessee Healthcare), **Sharecare/HDS** (Scenic Mountain Medical Center), and **Datavant** (Proliance Surgeons).

## Portal vs. PDF Coexistence

When a portal exists, a PDF form is almost always still available alongside it. Of the 7 orgs with a dedicated online portal, **6 also offer a downloadable PDF form**. The sole exception is Minnie Hamilton Health System, where no MHHS-branded PDF exists — the ChartRequest portal is the only pathway, and finding a form requires navigating to an affiliate's website. This gated-only approach earned Minnie Hamilton a findability score of 2 and a content design score of 2.

## Primary vs. Secondary Role

Among orgs with any portal pathway:

| Portal as primary | Portal as secondary | Total |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 6 | 11 |

The 5 orgs using a portal as their **primary** pathway are: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford (Swellbox), Minnie Hamilton (ChartRequest), Esse Health (DocuSign), Wayne County Hospital (web form), and Arizona Community Physicians (Swellbox). Notably, Wayne County Hospital — a 25-bed critical access hospital in rural Kentucky — built its own HTML web form, a rare approach for a facility of its size.

## Patterns by Organization Type

**System-affiliated community hospitals** are the most likely to adopt Swellbox/Datavant portals. Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford (Ascension system, 286 beds) exemplifies this pattern — the parent system deploys Swellbox across facilities while maintaining a generic PDF fallback.

**Independent physician practices** show the most digital innovation: Esse Health uses DocuSign for fully electronic submission, Arizona Community Physicians deploys Swellbox, and Proliance Surgeons references Datavant. Three of 5 practices in this batch (60%) have some portal option.

**FQHCs** are split: Penobscot Community Health Care uses Swellbox as its primary pathway, while the other 4 FQHCs (Cherokee Health Systems, NorthLakes, Virginia Garcia, Northwest Colorado Health) rely entirely on PDF forms.

**Critical access hospitals** largely lack portals (6 of 7 have PDF-only processes), with Wayne County Hospital's web form as the notable exception.

**Teaching hospitals** (Northwestern Memorial, UF Health Shands, Mass General, Banner–UMC Phoenix) are conspicuously absent from the portal adopter list. Banner mentions its MyChart portal on the form header as a redirect, but none offer a structured online request workflow — they rely on high-quality PDF forms with multiple submission channels instead.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Portal adoption is modest at ~29%**, with Swellbox/Datavant emerging as the leading vendor for dedicated records request portals.
2. **Portals almost always coexist with PDFs** — only one org (Minnie Hamilton) has gone portal-only, and that approach created significant transparency and findability problems.
3. **Portal presence does not guarantee a better patient experience.** Minnie Hamilton's ChartRequest portal scored a 2.95 overall (grade C) due to opaque gating behind account creation. By contrast, GHC–South Central Wisconsin achieved 4.40 (grade B) with a fillable PDF and no portal at all.
4. **MyChart is ubiquitous but passive** — it serves as a delivery channel, not a request initiation tool, at every organization where it appears.
5. **The most innovative digital approaches come from independent practices** (DocuSign, Swellbox) and one small rural hospital (Wayne County's web form), not from the largest academic medical centers.
