# Portal Landscape Analysis — Batch 1

## Overview

Of 190 organizations analyzed, **94 (49.5%)** offer some form of online portal or patient portal pathway for requesting medical records. The remaining 96 orgs rely exclusively on PDF forms submitted via fax, mail, email, or in person.

## Vendor Landscape

Two platforms dominate the portal space, together accounting for nearly two-thirds of all portal-equipped orgs:

| Vendor / Platform | Count | Share of Portal Orgs |
|---|---|---|
| Epic MyChart | 29 | 31% |
| Swellbox / Datavant | 30 | 32% |
| MRO / Ciox / HealthMark | 4 | 4% |
| Sharecare / HDS | 4 | 4% |
| MediCopy | 2 | 2% |
| ChartRequest | 2 | 2% |
| Other (athenahealth, Verisma, DocuSign, Formstack, JotForm, ScanSTAT, etc.) | 14 | 15% |
| Unidentified | 9 | 10% |

**Epic MyChart** functions as a patient portal where records are accessed or requested through an authenticated session. It appears across every facility type, from teaching hospitals (NYP, UCSF, Duke) to FQHCs (Erie Family Health, El Rio Health, Sea Mar) and critical access hospitals (Essentia Health–Fosston, Myrtue Medical Center).

**Swellbox/Datavant** operates differently — it provides a standalone "eRequest wizard" that does not require an existing patient portal account. It is heavily used by health systems that outsource ROI processing (Ascension, HCA/Piedmont, Hackensack Meridian, AdventHealth).

The long tail includes e-signature tools repurposed for ROI (DocuSign at Esse Health, RightSignature at East Georgia Healthcare), generic form builders (JotForm at Rio Grande Hospital, Formstack at Labette Health), and specialized ROI vendors (ScanSTAT, MediCopy, ChartSwap).

## Portal as Primary vs. Secondary Pathway

Among the 94 portal-equipped orgs:

- **42 (45%)** designate the portal as the **primary** pathway for records requests.
- **52 (55%)** list the portal as a **secondary** or supplementary option alongside a PDF form.

When MyChart is present, it is typically listed as secondary — the org still offers a downloadable PDF form as the main pathway and mentions MyChart as an alternative for existing portal users. In contrast, Swellbox/Datavant portals are more often the primary pathway, serving as the main mechanism the org directs patients toward.

## PDF Availability Alongside Portals

Of the 94 orgs with portals, **80 (85%)** still provide a downloadable PDF form as well. Only **14 orgs (15%)** offer a portal with no accompanying PDF form. These portal-only orgs include AdventHealth Hendersonville, Anaheim Global Medical Center, Aaron E. Henry CHC, El Rio Health, East Georgia Healthcare Center, Franklin Primary Health Center, Gastro Florida, HopeHealth, King's Daughters Medical Center, La Clínica de La Raza, Labette Health, Minnie Hamilton Health System, Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers, and The Iowa Clinic.

The portal-only group is diverse — spanning FQHCs, community hospitals, a critical access hospital, and physician practices — suggesting no single org profile drives this pattern.

## Patterns by Organization Type

**Facility type**: Physician practices (58%) and FQHCs (56%) have the highest portal adoption rates, while critical access hospitals trail significantly at 28%. Community hospitals sit at 54% and teaching hospitals at 47%.

**System affiliation**: Major-system hospitals lead at 55%, followed by regional systems (50%) and independents (45%). System affiliation matters partly because large systems tend to deploy Epic MyChart or Swellbox uniformly across facilities.

**Ownership**: For-profit organizations show the highest portal rate (61%), likely reflecting HCA and Tenet facilities with standardized MyHealthONE or Swellbox portals. Government-owned facilities are notably low at 25%. Nonprofits fall in the middle at 50%.

**Region**: The South leads slightly at 55%, followed by the West (51%), with the Midwest (43%) and Northeast (44%) somewhat lower.

## Notable Observations

1. **MyChart as delivery vs. request mechanism**: Several orgs (Yale New Haven, Guthrie Corning) note MyChart is used to *deliver* records but not to *submit* requests. The portal exists, but patients still need a PDF form to initiate the process.

2. **Vendor fragmentation beyond the top two**: The long tail of 15+ smaller vendors means patients encounter wildly different interfaces depending on provider. Some are polished (ChartRequest, Verisma), while others are repurposed general-purpose tools (JotForm, Zoho Creator, DocuSign).

3. **Critical access hospitals are underserved**: At 28% portal adoption — roughly half the rate of other facility types — small rural hospitals remain the most dependent on paper-based workflows.

4. **Government facilities lag**: Only 25% have portals, the lowest of any ownership category, despite including large academic medical centers (Michigan Medicine, UTMB, MUSC).
