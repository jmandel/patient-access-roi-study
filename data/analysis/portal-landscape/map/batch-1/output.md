# Batch 1 — Portal Landscape Analysis

## Overall Portal Adoption

Of the 71 organizations in this batch, **36 (51%)** offer at least one type of online portal for medical records requests. This breaks down into two distinct categories: **23 orgs (32%)** provide a dedicated ROI-specific online portal (e.g., a request wizard or web form), and **27 orgs (38%)** reference a patient portal (e.g., MyChart) as a records access channel. Ten orgs offer both types. The remaining 35 organizations rely exclusively on PDF forms with fax, mail, or email submission.

## Vendor Landscape

**Swellbox/Datavant** dominates the ROI-specific portal market, powering **15 of 23** online portals (65%). These appear as "records request wizard" pages hosted on swellbox.com, spanning large systems like Emory Healthcare and Bon Secours Mercy Health as well as mid-size community hospitals like Harris Health System and Kootenai Health. Three orgs use **MRO/Ciox** portals, including Sentara and Henry Ford Health. The remaining five online portals use a mix of vendors: **Verisma** (NewYork-Presbyterian), **JotForm** (Rio Grande Hospital), **Zoho Creator** (Springhill Medical Center), **Formstack** (Covenant Health Plainview), and **MediCopy/HelloSign** (Duly Health and Care's secondary pathway).

For patient portals, **Epic MyChart** accounts for **20 of 27** references (74%). Other EHR portals include Cerner/Oracle Health, eClinicalWorks, and athenahealth, each appearing once or twice.

## PDF Co-Existence

Portals almost never replace the traditional PDF form. **35 of 36** portal-offering orgs still maintain downloadable PDF authorization forms alongside their digital pathway. The sole exception is **The Iowa Clinic**, which appears to have fully transitioned to a Swellbox portal as its primary pathway with no current PDF form linked on its website. Even orgs that designate the portal as primary — like CrescentCare and NewYork-Presbyterian — keep PDF forms available as fallback options. This near-universal co-existence suggests that portals are layered on top of existing paper-based processes rather than replacing them.

## Primary vs. Secondary Pathway

In most cases, the portal is a **secondary option**. Only **15 of 36** portal orgs (42%) designate any portal as the primary request pathway — 11 using an online portal and 4 using a patient portal. For the remaining 21 orgs, portals appear as alternatives mentioned alongside the primary PDF form.

Notable primary-portal orgs include:
- **CrescentCare** (FQHC, New Orleans): a website-native online request form is the primary pathway, with bilingual PDF forms as secondary options
- **NewYork-Presbyterian**: uses a Verisma portal with identity verification as its primary pathway
- **Valley Hospital** (Ridgewood, NJ): offers an online portal with identity verification as primary
- **The Iowa Clinic**: Swellbox portal is the only current pathway — the most fully digital transition in the batch

When the PDF form is primary (the majority pattern), the portal is typically listed as one of several submission alternatives alongside fax and mail. Emory University Hospital exemplifies this: a fillable PDF authorization is primary, with Swellbox mentioned as a secondary digital option.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Portal adoption correlates with organizational size and system affiliation:

- **Community hospitals** show the highest adoption at **57%** (20/35 have some portal)
- **Teaching hospitals** follow at **50%** (7/14)
- **Physician practices** cluster around **44%** (4/9)
- **Critical access hospitals** have the lowest rate at **25%** (2/8), consistent with their smaller scale and more limited IT resources

**System-affiliated orgs** adopt portals at higher rates (**62%** for major-system affiliates) compared to **independent orgs (43%)**. This likely reflects the economies of scale in deploying portal infrastructure across a health system — a single Swellbox or MyChart contract can cover dozens of facilities. Ownership type shows less differentiation: nonprofit and for-profit orgs adopt portals at similar rates, though the two government-owned orgs in the batch (Harris Health System and Rio Grande Hospital) both offer portals.

## Key Takeaways

The portal landscape in this batch is transitional. Half the orgs offer some digital pathway, but portals typically supplement rather than replace PDF-based workflows. Swellbox/Datavant has emerged as the dominant third-party ROI portal vendor, while MyChart references are common but often function as a records *viewing* tool rather than a formal records *request* mechanism. The near-total persistence of PDF forms alongside portals — and the fact that most orgs still designate the PDF as primary — indicates that full digital transformation of the records request process remains uncommon.
