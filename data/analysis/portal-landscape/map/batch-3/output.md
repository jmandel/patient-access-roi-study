# Portal Landscape Analysis — Batch 3

## Overall Portal Adoption

Of the 190 organizations with scored synthesis data, **94 (49.5%)** offer some form of online portal or patient portal pathway for requesting medical records. This is a near-even split: half the healthcare landscape has moved at least partially toward digital request workflows, while the other half relies exclusively on downloadable PDFs, fax, mail, or phone-based processes.

Among portal-equipped organizations, **42 designate the portal as the primary pathway** for records requests, while **52 list it as a secondary or supplementary option** — typically behind a downloadable PDF form. The portal, in other words, is more often a convenience option than the main front door.

## Vendor Landscape

Two vendors dominate the portal ecosystem:

| Vendor | Count | Role |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Epic MyChart** | 37 | Patient portal with embedded records access |
| **Swellbox/Datavant** | 28 (incl. Ciox/Swellbox) | Dedicated ROI request wizard |
| Unknown/unspecified | 14 | Often generic portal mentions |
| JotForm | 3 | Lightweight form builder |
| ChartRequest | 2 | Records request platform |
| Formstack | 2 | Form builder |
| Sharecare/HDS | 3 | Records request platform |
| MRO/Ciox | 2 | Health information management |
| Other (9 vendors) | 9 | DocuSign, Luma Health, Verisma, etc. |

**Epic MyChart** functions as a general patient portal where records access is one feature among many. It skews toward *secondary* use: 31 of 37 MyChart instances are listed as non-primary, meaning the organization still leads with a PDF form or other pathway and mentions MyChart as an alternative. Only 6 orgs designate MyChart as the primary records request channel.

**Swellbox/Datavant** is the opposite: a purpose-built ROI request wizard. Of its 28 appearances, 17 are the *primary* pathway. Swellbox is strongly associated with major health systems — 19 of 28 Swellbox users are major-system-affiliated (e.g., Ascension, AdventHealth, Bon Secours, Vanderbilt). It appears to be rolled out at the system level as a standardized records request solution.

## PDF + Portal Coexistence

When a portal exists, **85% of the time (80/94) a PDF form is also available** alongside it. Only 14 organizations offer a portal with no downloadable PDF at all. These portal-only orgs are disproportionately FQHCs (7 of 14) and independent facilities (11 of 14), suggesting that smaller organizations sometimes replace rather than supplement paper-based processes. Examples include El Rio Health (Epic MyChart only), HopeHealth (HealthMark Group), and La Clínica de La Raza (OCHIN/Epic MyChart).

Among the 42 orgs where the portal is the primary pathway, 31 still maintain a PDF form as a fallback — a pragmatic dual-channel approach.

## Patterns by Organization Type

**Facility type.** Portal adoption is relatively consistent across facility types, with one exception: critical access hospitals lag significantly at 27% (8/30), compared to 52–56% for community hospitals, FQHCs, and physician practices. Teaching hospitals fall in between at 47% (14/30). The smallest rural facilities have been slowest to adopt digital request workflows.

**System affiliation.** Major-system-affiliated organizations adopt portals at a higher rate (55%) than independents (43%), with regional systems in between (50%). Major systems also deploy different technology: they favor Swellbox/Datavant (19 orgs) and Epic MyChart (17 orgs), often with system-wide standardization. Independent facilities show more vendor diversity and are more likely to use lightweight tools like JotForm, Formstack, or DocuSign.

**Ownership.** Government-owned facilities have the lowest portal adoption at just 25% (6/24) — notable exceptions being Memorial Healthcare System (MyChart), Michigan Medicine (MyChart), and UTMB Health (Datavant). For-profit organizations lead at 57% (25/44), with nonprofits at 50% (63/127).

**Geography.** The South has slightly higher portal adoption (54%) than other regions, with the Midwest lowest at 42%. Differences are modest and likely reflect the concentration of large for-profit systems in the South.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Half of U.S. healthcare organizations now offer some portal pathway** for records requests, but the portal is primary in fewer than half of those cases.
2. **The market is a duopoly**: Epic MyChart and Swellbox/Datavant account for roughly 70% of identified portal vendors, serving very different functions — general patient portal vs. dedicated ROI wizard.
3. **PDF forms persist**: even when a portal exists, 85% of organizations still provide a downloadable form, creating a dual-channel landscape rather than a clean digital transition.
4. **Government and rural facilities lag**: critical access hospitals (27%) and government-owned facilities (25%) have significantly lower portal adoption, suggesting a digital divide in records access infrastructure.
5. **System affiliation drives standardization**: major systems deploy Swellbox/Datavant or MyChart system-wide, producing consistent (if not always patient-centered) portal experiences across their facilities.
