# Portal & Online Request Landscape — Batch 0

## Adoption Overview

Of the 72 organizations in this batch, **23 (32%)** offer a dedicated online ROI request portal — a web-based interface (distinct from the EHR patient portal) where patients can initiate a records request without downloading and printing a PDF. An additional **15 orgs (21%)** reference a patient portal (typically Epic MyChart) as a records-access channel, though these portals are EHR-tethered rather than standalone ROI tools. In total, **34 orgs (47%)** surface at least one digital request pathway beyond a downloadable PDF form. The remaining 38 orgs (53%) rely exclusively on PDF download plus fax, mail, or in-person delivery.

## Vendor Landscape

**Swellbox / Datavant** dominates the standalone ROI portal market, appearing in roughly 10 deployments under varying labels ("Swellbox/Datavant," "Swellbox," "Ciox/Swellbox"). This reflects Datavant's consolidation of former Ciox and Swellbox products into a single release-of-information platform. Other vendors each appear one to two times:

- **MRO/Ciox** — UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital (MRO Express)
- **Verisma** — Froedtert & MCW, Bronson Methodist
- **ShareCare** — Eastern Maine Medical Center
- **MediCopy** — Flowers Hospital
- **HealthMark Group** — Southeast Georgia Health System
- **Formstack** — Baptist Medical Center South
- **JotForm** — used by smaller facilities for simple web intake
- **RightSignature / Luma Health / athenahealth** — scattered single appearances

Among patient-portal references, **Epic MyChart** accounts for 9 of the 15 mentions, consistent with Epic's market share among teaching hospitals and large systems. The remainder cite athenahealth or generic "patient portal" language.

## PDF Coexistence

Almost universally, portals supplement rather than replace PDF forms. **19 of 23 portal orgs (83%)** still host a downloadable PDF authorization form alongside the portal. Only four organizations appear to operate portal-only workflows with no publicly posted PDF:

1. **AdventHealth Hendersonville** — directs patients entirely to its AdventHealth portal
2. **East Georgia Healthcare Center** — uses an online form with no PDF alternative
3. **Labette Health** — Swellbox portal is the sole documented pathway
4. **HopeHealth** — online submission via web form only

This pattern suggests that even digitally progressive organizations retain PDF forms as a fallback — likely to accommodate patients who lack internet access, prefer paper, or are submitting through third-party representatives.

## Primary vs. Secondary Pathway

The portal is the **primary** request pathway for **15 orgs (21%)** — meaning the website directs patients to the portal first, with PDF as a secondary option or not offered at all. For **8 orgs (11%)**, the portal is listed as a secondary or alternative channel, with the PDF form remaining the default. Flowers Hospital (Dothan, AL) exemplifies the portal-primary model: its MediCopy portal is prominently linked from the medical records page, while the PDF form is available but not emphasized.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Portal adoption clusters along several axes:

- **Facility type:** Community hospitals lead portal adoption (roughly half of portal orgs), followed by teaching hospitals. Critical access hospitals rarely offer portals — only 2 of the ~15 CAHs in this batch have one, consistent with their resource constraints.
- **System affiliation:** Organizations affiliated with major health systems (AdventHealth, WellStar, Baptist Health, UCHealth) are far more likely to offer portals than independent facilities. System-affiliated orgs benefit from enterprise-wide vendor contracts with Swellbox/Datavant or MRO.
- **Region:** Portal orgs skew toward the **South** census region, which accounts for roughly 40% of portal deployments — partly reflecting the batch composition but also the concentration of large Southern systems (Baptist Health, AdventHealth, WellStar) that have standardized on ROI portal vendors.
- **Ownership:** Nonprofit organizations dominate portal adoption, though this mirrors the batch's overall nonprofit skew rather than indicating an independent ownership effect.

## Key Takeaway

The portal landscape is bifurcated: system-affiliated community and teaching hospitals increasingly offer vendor-managed ROI portals (led by Swellbox/Datavant), while independent and critical access hospitals remain PDF-and-fax operations. Even where portals exist, PDF forms persist as a parallel channel in over 80% of cases, indicating the field is in a transitional phase rather than a post-paper one.
