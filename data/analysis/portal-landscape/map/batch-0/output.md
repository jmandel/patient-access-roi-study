# Portal and Online Request Landscape

## Overview

Of 190 organizations analyzed, **98 (52%)** offer some form of online portal or electronic request pathway for medical records. However, only **19 (10%)** use a portal as their *primary* pathway — meaning the portal is the main way patients are directed to request records. For most organizations with a portal, it exists as a secondary or alternative option alongside a traditional PDF form.

## Vendor Landscape

Two platforms dominate the portal space:

| Vendor | Orgs | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **MyChart (Epic)** | 39 | Patient portal with records access; rarely the primary ROI pathway |
| **Swellbox/Datavant** | 33 | Dedicated records-request wizard; often the primary pathway |
| MRO Express | 5 | Third-party ROI fulfillment portal |
| Sharecare/HDS | 4 | Third-party records platform |
| MediCopy | 3 | Electronic authorization via HelloSign |
| ChartRequest | 2 | Account-creation-required portal |
| ScanSTAT | 2 | Third-party records processor |
| Other (Formstack, JotForm, Verisma, DocuSign, athenahealth, etc.) | 10+ | Various one-off solutions |

**MyChart** appears at 39 organizations but is almost always a *secondary* pathway — patients are told they can use the portal, but the primary records request process still involves a downloadable PDF authorization form. In contrast, **Swellbox/Datavant** tends to be the primary pathway: of 33 Swellbox orgs, roughly half position it as the main request mechanism, directing patients to an online wizard before mentioning a PDF fallback.

## PDF Availability Alongside Portals

When a portal exists, **86% (84 of 98) still offer a downloadable PDF form** as an alternative. Only 14 organizations are portal-only with no PDF available. Portal-only orgs include a mix of types: FQHCs like El Rio Health and Franklin Primary Health Center (MyChart-only, no form), hospital systems like AdventHealth Hendersonville (Swellbox-only), and specialty groups like Gastro Florida (Sharecare-only). Notably, several portal-only FQHCs effectively have *no* accessible pathway — they mention a portal login but provide no public-facing form, leaving patients who lack portal accounts without a clear option.

## Primary vs. Secondary Role

Of the 19 orgs where the portal *is* the primary pathway type, most use Swellbox/Datavant or a similar dedicated records-request tool rather than a general patient portal. This distinction matters: Swellbox-style portals are purpose-built for ROI requests with identity verification and electronic authorization, while MyChart portals offer records access as one feature among many and typically don't replace the formal ROI authorization process.

The remaining 79 portal-mentioning orgs treat the portal as a secondary channel. Typically the pattern is: "Download and print this authorization form, fill it out, and fax it back — or you can request records through MyChart."

## Patterns by Organization Type

**Facility type** shows clear differentiation. Community hospitals (58%), physician practices (58%), and FQHCs (56%) lead in portal adoption, while **critical access hospitals lag at just 28%** — only 8 of 29 CAHs mention any portal pathway, and only 1 (Minnie Hamilton) uses a portal as its primary pathway. Teaching hospitals sit at 50%.

**System affiliation** is a moderate predictor: major-system hospitals adopt portals at 60% vs. 45% for independents. This likely reflects system-wide Epic/MyChart deployments and enterprise contracts with vendors like Swellbox. Regional systems fall between at 53%.

**Ownership** reveals the starkest gap: for-profit organizations lead at 63%, nonprofits at 53%, and **government hospitals trail at just 25%** — only 6 of 24 government facilities mention any portal, and none use one as a primary pathway. Government hospitals disproportionately rely on fax-and-mail PDF workflows.

## Notable Findings

Several organizations illustrate the gap between "having a portal" and "having an accessible process." La Clínica de La Raza mentions MyChart but requires patients to mail a letter to a P.O. Box for formal records requests. East Georgia Healthcare Center's only online form is a RightSignature document designed for *incoming* transfers, not patient self-access. These cases show that portal presence in the data doesn't always translate to a functional patient-facing online request pathway — the portal may serve a different purpose entirely.

The Swellbox/Datavant platform appears across multiple large health systems (Ascension, AdventHealth, HCA/TriStar, Bon Secours Mercy, Piedmont) as a standardized records-request tool, suggesting enterprise-level adoption decisions rather than facility-level choices. By contrast, MyChart deployments are more universal but less likely to replace the traditional authorization form workflow.
