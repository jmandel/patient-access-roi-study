You are analyzing org-level synthesis data for a study of healthcare provider form quality.

Read DESIGN.md and ANALYSIS-PLAN.md for context.

Scores.json files for a batch of organizations are included inline below.
Focus on the access_pathway fields.
org-lookup.json maps org_id → full org metadata (facility_type, ownership, system_affiliation,
census_region, state, city). Use this to identify patterns by org type.

Your task: characterize the portal/online request landscape in this batch.
- How many orgs offer an online portal or patient portal pathway?
- Which vendors/platforms appear (Swellbox, MyChart, etc.)?
- When a portal exists, is a PDF form still available alongside it?
- Is the portal the primary pathway or a secondary option?
- Any notable patterns about which types of orgs have portals?

Write your findings to "output.md". Include counts and specific examples.
Keep to 500-800 words.
