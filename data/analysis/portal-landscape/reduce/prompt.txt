# Portal & Online Request Landscape — Batch 0

## Adoption Overview

Of the 72 organizations in this batch, **23 (32%)** offer a dedicated online ROI request portal — a web-based interface (distinct from the EHR patient portal) where patients can initiate a records request without downloading and printing a PDF. An additional **15 orgs (21%)** reference a patient portal (typically Epic MyChart) as a records-access channel, though these portals are EHR-tethered rather than standalone ROI tools. In total, **34 orgs (47%)** surface at least one digital request pathway beyond a downloadable PDF form. The remaining 38 orgs (53%) rely exclusively on PDF download plus fax, mail, or in-person delivery.

## Vendor Landscape

**Swellbox / Datavant** dominates the standalone ROI portal market, appearing in roughly 10 deployments under varying labels ("Swellbox/Datavant," "Swellbox," "Ciox/Swellbox"). This reflects Datavant's consolidation of former Ciox and Swellbox products into a single release-of-information platform. Other vendors each appear one to two times:

- **MRO/Ciox** — UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital (MRO Express)
- **Verisma** — Froedtert & MCW, Bronson Methodist
- **ShareCare** — Eastern Maine Medical Center
- **MediCopy** — Flowers Hospital
- **HealthMark Group** — Southeast Georgia Health System
- **Formstack** — Baptist Medical Center South
- **JotForm** — used by smaller facilities for simple web intake
- **RightSignature / Luma Health / athenahealth** — scattered single appearances

Among patient-portal references, **Epic MyChart** accounts for 9 of the 15 mentions, consistent with Epic's market share among teaching hospitals and large systems. The remainder cite athenahealth or generic "patient portal" language.

## PDF Coexistence

Almost universally, portals supplement rather than replace PDF forms. **19 of 23 portal orgs (83%)** still host a downloadable PDF authorization form alongside the portal. Only four organizations appear to operate portal-only workflows with no publicly posted PDF:

1. **AdventHealth Hendersonville** — directs patients entirely to its AdventHealth portal
2. **East Georgia Healthcare Center** — uses an online form with no PDF alternative
3. **Labette Health** — Swellbox portal is the sole documented pathway
4. **HopeHealth** — online submission via web form only

This pattern suggests that even digitally progressive organizations retain PDF forms as a fallback — likely to accommodate patients who lack internet access, prefer paper, or are submitting through third-party representatives.

## Primary vs. Secondary Pathway

The portal is the **primary** request pathway for **15 orgs (21%)** — meaning the website directs patients to the portal first, with PDF as a secondary option or not offered at all. For **8 orgs (11%)**, the portal is listed as a secondary or alternative channel, with the PDF form remaining the default. Flowers Hospital (Dothan, AL) exemplifies the portal-primary model: its MediCopy portal is prominently linked from the medical records page, while the PDF form is available but not emphasized.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Portal adoption clusters along several axes:

- **Facility type:** Community hospitals lead portal adoption (roughly half of portal orgs), followed by teaching hospitals. Critical access hospitals rarely offer portals — only 2 of the ~15 CAHs in this batch have one, consistent with their resource constraints.
- **System affiliation:** Organizations affiliated with major health systems (AdventHealth, WellStar, Baptist Health, UCHealth) are far more likely to offer portals than independent facilities. System-affiliated orgs benefit from enterprise-wide vendor contracts with Swellbox/Datavant or MRO.
- **Region:** Portal orgs skew toward the **South** census region, which accounts for roughly 40% of portal deployments — partly reflecting the batch composition but also the concentration of large Southern systems (Baptist Health, AdventHealth, WellStar) that have standardized on ROI portal vendors.
- **Ownership:** Nonprofit organizations dominate portal adoption, though this mirrors the batch's overall nonprofit skew rather than indicating an independent ownership effect.

## Key Takeaway

The portal landscape is bifurcated: system-affiliated community and teaching hospitals increasingly offer vendor-managed ROI portals (led by Swellbox/Datavant), while independent and critical access hospitals remain PDF-and-fax operations. Even where portals exist, PDF forms persist as a parallel channel in over 80% of cases, indicating the field is in a transitional phase rather than a post-paper one.

# Batch 1 — Portal Landscape Analysis

## Overall Portal Adoption

Of the 71 organizations in this batch, **36 (51%)** offer at least one type of online portal for medical records requests. This breaks down into two distinct categories: **23 orgs (32%)** provide a dedicated ROI-specific online portal (e.g., a request wizard or web form), and **27 orgs (38%)** reference a patient portal (e.g., MyChart) as a records access channel. Ten orgs offer both types. The remaining 35 organizations rely exclusively on PDF forms with fax, mail, or email submission.

## Vendor Landscape

**Swellbox/Datavant** dominates the ROI-specific portal market, powering **15 of 23** online portals (65%). These appear as "records request wizard" pages hosted on swellbox.com, spanning large systems like Emory Healthcare and Bon Secours Mercy Health as well as mid-size community hospitals like Harris Health System and Kootenai Health. Three orgs use **MRO/Ciox** portals, including Sentara and Henry Ford Health. The remaining five online portals use a mix of vendors: **Verisma** (NewYork-Presbyterian), **JotForm** (Rio Grande Hospital), **Zoho Creator** (Springhill Medical Center), **Formstack** (Covenant Health Plainview), and **MediCopy/HelloSign** (Duly Health and Care's secondary pathway).

For patient portals, **Epic MyChart** accounts for **20 of 27** references (74%). Other EHR portals include Cerner/Oracle Health, eClinicalWorks, and athenahealth, each appearing once or twice.

## PDF Co-Existence

Portals almost never replace the traditional PDF form. **35 of 36** portal-offering orgs still maintain downloadable PDF authorization forms alongside their digital pathway. The sole exception is **The Iowa Clinic**, which appears to have fully transitioned to a Swellbox portal as its primary pathway with no current PDF form linked on its website. Even orgs that designate the portal as primary — like CrescentCare and NewYork-Presbyterian — keep PDF forms available as fallback options. This near-universal co-existence suggests that portals are layered on top of existing paper-based processes rather than replacing them.

## Primary vs. Secondary Pathway

In most cases, the portal is a **secondary option**. Only **15 of 36** portal orgs (42%) designate any portal as the primary request pathway — 11 using an online portal and 4 using a patient portal. For the remaining 21 orgs, portals appear as alternatives mentioned alongside the primary PDF form.

Notable primary-portal orgs include:
- **CrescentCare** (FQHC, New Orleans): a website-native online request form is the primary pathway, with bilingual PDF forms as secondary options
- **NewYork-Presbyterian**: uses a Verisma portal with identity verification as its primary pathway
- **Valley Hospital** (Ridgewood, NJ): offers an online portal with identity verification as primary
- **The Iowa Clinic**: Swellbox portal is the only current pathway — the most fully digital transition in the batch

When the PDF form is primary (the majority pattern), the portal is typically listed as one of several submission alternatives alongside fax and mail. Emory University Hospital exemplifies this: a fillable PDF authorization is primary, with Swellbox mentioned as a secondary digital option.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Portal adoption correlates with organizational size and system affiliation:

- **Community hospitals** show the highest adoption at **57%** (20/35 have some portal)
- **Teaching hospitals** follow at **50%** (7/14)
- **Physician practices** cluster around **44%** (4/9)
- **Critical access hospitals** have the lowest rate at **25%** (2/8), consistent with their smaller scale and more limited IT resources

**System-affiliated orgs** adopt portals at higher rates (**62%** for major-system affiliates) compared to **independent orgs (43%)**. This likely reflects the economies of scale in deploying portal infrastructure across a health system — a single Swellbox or MyChart contract can cover dozens of facilities. Ownership type shows less differentiation: nonprofit and for-profit orgs adopt portals at similar rates, though the two government-owned orgs in the batch (Harris Health System and Rio Grande Hospital) both offer portals.

## Key Takeaways

The portal landscape in this batch is transitional. Half the orgs offer some digital pathway, but portals typically supplement rather than replace PDF-based workflows. Swellbox/Datavant has emerged as the dominant third-party ROI portal vendor, while MyChart references are common but often function as a records *viewing* tool rather than a formal records *request* mechanism. The near-total persistence of PDF forms alongside portals — and the fact that most orgs still designate the PDF as primary — indicates that full digital transformation of the records request process remains uncommon.

# Portal & Online Request Landscape — Batch 2

## Summary Counts

Of 38 organizations in this batch, **11 (29%)** include some form of online portal or patient portal as a request pathway. The remaining 27 rely exclusively on PDF forms with fax/mail/email submission.

Portal presence breaks down into two categories:

- **Dedicated online request portals** (7 orgs): Third-party platforms that serve as the primary or secondary digital submission channel — Swellbox/Datavant (3), ChartRequest (1), DocuSign (1), ScanSTAT (1), Sharecare/HDS (1), Datavant standalone (1).
- **Patient portals mentioned as secondary options** (6 orgs): Epic MyChart (5) and Athena Health (1), typically listed as a delivery mechanism or alternative rather than a primary request pathway. Two orgs appear in both categories (Minnie Hamilton has both ChartRequest and Athena; Proliance has Datavant alongside other pathways).

## Vendor Landscape

**Swellbox/Datavant** is the dominant third-party records request vendor, appearing at 3 organizations: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford (TN), Arizona Community Physicians (AZ), and Penobscot Community Health Care (ME). In all three cases, the Swellbox wizard is the **primary** pathway, with PDF forms relegated to secondary status.

**Epic MyChart** appears at 5 organizations (Aurora Medical Center–Grafton, Owensboro Health, Guthrie Corning, Myrtue Medical Center, Banner–University Medical Center Phoenix) but always as a **secondary** option — typically for record delivery rather than request initiation. None make MyChart the primary request channel.

Other vendors appear once each: **ChartRequest** (Minnie Hamilton Health System), **DocuSign** (Esse Health), **ScanSTAT** (West Tennessee Healthcare), **Sharecare/HDS** (Scenic Mountain Medical Center), and **Datavant** (Proliance Surgeons).

## Portal vs. PDF Coexistence

When a portal exists, a PDF form is almost always still available alongside it. Of the 7 orgs with a dedicated online portal, **6 also offer a downloadable PDF form**. The sole exception is Minnie Hamilton Health System, where no MHHS-branded PDF exists — the ChartRequest portal is the only pathway, and finding a form requires navigating to an affiliate's website. This gated-only approach earned Minnie Hamilton a findability score of 2 and a content design score of 2.

## Primary vs. Secondary Role

Among orgs with any portal pathway:

| Portal as primary | Portal as secondary | Total |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 6 | 11 |

The 5 orgs using a portal as their **primary** pathway are: Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford (Swellbox), Minnie Hamilton (ChartRequest), Esse Health (DocuSign), Wayne County Hospital (web form), and Arizona Community Physicians (Swellbox). Notably, Wayne County Hospital — a 25-bed critical access hospital in rural Kentucky — built its own HTML web form, a rare approach for a facility of its size.

## Patterns by Organization Type

**System-affiliated community hospitals** are the most likely to adopt Swellbox/Datavant portals. Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford (Ascension system, 286 beds) exemplifies this pattern — the parent system deploys Swellbox across facilities while maintaining a generic PDF fallback.

**Independent physician practices** show the most digital innovation: Esse Health uses DocuSign for fully electronic submission, Arizona Community Physicians deploys Swellbox, and Proliance Surgeons references Datavant. Three of 5 practices in this batch (60%) have some portal option.

**FQHCs** are split: Penobscot Community Health Care uses Swellbox as its primary pathway, while the other 4 FQHCs (Cherokee Health Systems, NorthLakes, Virginia Garcia, Northwest Colorado Health) rely entirely on PDF forms.

**Critical access hospitals** largely lack portals (6 of 7 have PDF-only processes), with Wayne County Hospital's web form as the notable exception.

**Teaching hospitals** (Northwestern Memorial, UF Health Shands, Mass General, Banner–UMC Phoenix) are conspicuously absent from the portal adopter list. Banner mentions its MyChart portal on the form header as a redirect, but none offer a structured online request workflow — they rely on high-quality PDF forms with multiple submission channels instead.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Portal adoption is modest at ~29%**, with Swellbox/Datavant emerging as the leading vendor for dedicated records request portals.
2. **Portals almost always coexist with PDFs** — only one org (Minnie Hamilton) has gone portal-only, and that approach created significant transparency and findability problems.
3. **Portal presence does not guarantee a better patient experience.** Minnie Hamilton's ChartRequest portal scored a 2.95 overall (grade C) due to opaque gating behind account creation. By contrast, GHC–South Central Wisconsin achieved 4.40 (grade B) with a fillable PDF and no portal at all.
4. **MyChart is ubiquitous but passive** — it serves as a delivery channel, not a request initiation tool, at every organization where it appears.
5. **The most innovative digital approaches come from independent practices** (DocuSign, Swellbox) and one small rural hospital (Wayne County's web form), not from the largest academic medical centers.
