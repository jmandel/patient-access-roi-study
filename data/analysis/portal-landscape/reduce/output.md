# The Portal Landscape: How Online Pathways Are Reshaping Medical Records Access

## Executive Summary

Across 190 healthcare organizations evaluated in this study, the portal landscape is split almost exactly in half: **~49% offer some form of online portal** for medical records requests, while the remaining 51% rely exclusively on downloadable PDF forms, fax, mail, or in-person processes. But portal *presence* and portal *primacy* are sharply different things. Only about 20% of all organizations position a portal as the primary pathway patients are directed toward — the rest treat it as a secondary or supplementary option alongside a traditional PDF authorization form. Two vendors — Epic MyChart and Swellbox/Datavant — dominate the market, accounting for roughly two-thirds of all identified portal deployments. PDF forms show no sign of disappearing: 85% of portal-equipped organizations still maintain a downloadable form alongside their portal.

## Portal Adoption: The 50/50 Split

The headline number is consistent across all ten batch analyses: approximately **94 of 190 organizations (49–52%)** offer at least one online portal or patient portal pathway for requesting medical records. This near-even split marks a transitional moment in healthcare records access — half the industry has moved toward some form of digital request workflow, while the other half has not.

Among the 94 portal-equipped organizations, the portal's role varies significantly:

- **~42 organizations (22% of all orgs)** designate the portal as the **primary pathway** — the main channel patients are directed toward on the organization's medical records page.
- **~52 organizations (27% of all orgs)** list the portal as a **secondary or supplementary** option, typically mentioned after a downloadable PDF form ("you can also request records through MyChart").

The dominant primary pathway across all 190 organizations remains the generic HIPAA authorization PDF form, used by roughly 75% of organizations as their main mechanism. Portals have supplemented but not yet supplanted paper-based workflows for most providers.

## Vendor Landscape: A Duopoly with a Long Tail

Two platforms dominate the portal ecosystem, serving fundamentally different functions:

### Epic MyChart (~33–40 organizations, ~35% of portal orgs)

MyChart is the most widely deployed patient portal in the study, appearing across every facility type — from teaching hospitals (Duke, Yale New Haven, UCSF, NewYork-Presbyterian) to community hospitals (Baptist Health Lexington, Saratoga Hospital) to FQHCs (Erie Family Health, El Rio Health, Sea Mar via OCHIN). However, **MyChart is almost always a secondary pathway**: of ~37 MyChart instances, only 5–7 designate it as primary. Organizations typically lead with a PDF form and mention MyChart as an alternative for existing portal users. In some cases (Yale New Haven, Guthrie Corning), MyChart is used to *deliver* records but not to *submit* requests — the portal exists, but patients still need a PDF form to initiate the process.

### Swellbox/Datavant (~28–33 organizations, ~31% of portal orgs)

Swellbox operates as a purpose-built records-request wizard — a standalone tool with identity verification and electronic authorization that doesn't require an existing patient portal account. When organizations adopt Swellbox, they are roughly three times more likely to make it the primary pathway (~17–20 primary vs. ~12 secondary). Swellbox is strongly associated with major health systems: Ascension, AdventHealth, HCA, Bon Secours Mercy Health, and Piedmont all deploy it across their facilities, suggesting enterprise-level procurement decisions rather than facility-level choices. When combined with related entities Ciox and Datavant, the platform appears at 35+ organizations, making the Datavant family arguably the single largest vendor in the ROI portal space.

### The Long Tail

Beyond the top two, the market fragments rapidly:

| Vendor | Approximate Count |
|---|---|
| Sharecare/HDS | 3–4 |
| MRO/Ciox/HealthMark | 3–5 |
| JotForm | 3–4 |
| ChartRequest | 2 |
| Formstack | 2 |
| Verisma | 2 |
| MediCopy | 2 |
| athenahealth | 2 |
| Other one-offs (DocuSign, ScanSTAT, Luma Health, RightSignature, Zoho, etc.) | ~10 |

The long tail reveals a secondary pattern: smaller and independent facilities sometimes repurpose general-purpose form tools (JotForm, Formstack, DocuSign) for records requests rather than adopting healthcare-specific platforms. These improvised solutions vary widely in quality and HIPAA compliance posture.

Approximately 20 organizations offer **both** a MyChart-style EHR portal and a Swellbox-style ROI vendor portal — creating a dual-channel approach where the ROI portal handles formal authorization-based releases while MyChart provides direct patient access to records already in the system. Examples include Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital, MUSC Health, NewYork-Presbyterian, and Mercy Health facilities. At Boulder Medical Center, records before September 2024 go through Swellbox while newer records require MyChart Sharing Hub — splitting the experience by date in a way that would confuse most patients.

## The PDF Question: Coexistence, Not Replacement

When a portal exists, **85% of organizations (80 of 94) still offer a downloadable PDF form** alongside it. Only **14 organizations** have gone portal-only with no PDF available. The PDF form is not going away — it is a fallback even at organizations that prominently promote their portal.

Portal-only organizations are a diverse group: FQHCs (El Rio Health, Franklin Primary Health Center, La Clínica de La Raza, Aaron E. Henry CHC, HopeHealth, People's Health Centers), community hospitals (AdventHealth Hendersonville, King's Daughters Medical Center), physician practices (Gastro Florida, The Iowa Clinic), and one critical access hospital (Minnie Hamilton Health System). Notably, several portal-only FQHCs present an accessibility concern — patients without portal accounts may have no clear public-facing pathway to request records, effectively stranding unregistered patients.

Even among the ~42 organizations where the portal is the primary pathway, roughly 31 still maintain a PDF form as a backup. The emerging model is **dual-channel** — portal plus PDF — rather than a clean digital transition. This pragmatic approach serves patients with varying levels of digital access, though it also means organizations must maintain two separate workflows.

## Is the Portal Trend Good or Bad for Patients?

### The Case for Portals

- **Convenience and speed.** Purpose-built portals like Swellbox offer guided workflows with electronic authorization, identity verification, and tracking — eliminating the print-sign-scan-fax cycle that PDF forms require.
- **Higher overall quality.** Portal-equipped organizations score higher on average (3.52 overall vs. 3.20 for non-portal orgs in one batch analysis), suggesting that portal adoption correlates with better digital infrastructure and more patient-oriented processes.
- **Democratizing access for small providers.** FQHCs achieve 56% portal adoption — comparable to much larger organizations — partly through collaborative infrastructure like OCHIN, which gives small community health centers the same MyChart platform as academic medical centers.
- **Always available.** Unlike fax machines or mail-in forms, portals are accessible 24/7 from any device with internet access.

### The Case Against (or at Least for Caution)

- **Portal ≠ better access.** Having a portal listed doesn't guarantee a functional pathway. Several organizations "have a portal" only in the sense that they mention a MyChart login — without providing any public-facing form for unregistered patients. La Clínica de La Raza mentions MyChart but requires patients to mail a letter to a P.O. Box for formal records requests.
- **Account-creation barriers.** Some portals (Anaheim Global Medical Center, ChartRequest-based sites) require account creation before patients can even see the authorization process — gating access behind registration that a simple PDF download does not require.
- **Fee concerns.** Swellbox/Datavant deployments often display per-page fee structures (e.g., $6.50 flat + $0.12/page), raising questions about compliance with HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient self-access requests.
- **Self-access differentiation remains rare.** Only about 20–25% of portal-equipped organizations clearly distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting on someone else's behalf. Most portals funnel both use cases through the same authorization workflow, imposing unnecessary complexity on patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.
- **Digital divide.** Portal adoption leaves behind the most vulnerable populations: government hospitals (25% adoption) and critical access hospitals in rural areas (28% adoption) are least likely to offer any online pathway.

## Patterns by Organizational Characteristics

### Facility Type

| Facility Type | Portal Adoption Rate |
|---|---|
| Physician practices | ~58% |
| FQHCs | ~56% |
| Community hospitals | ~54% |
| Teaching hospitals | ~47% |
| Critical access hospitals | **~28%** |

Critical access hospitals — small rural facilities — lag dramatically. Only 8 of ~29 CAHs mention any portal pathway, and just 1–4 use a portal as primary. This likely reflects resource constraints: portal deployments require vendor contracts, IT infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance that small rural facilities may not prioritize or afford. However, when CAHs do adopt portals, they tend to go all-in rather than maintaining dual pathways, suggesting a binary adoption dynamic.

### Ownership

| Ownership | Portal Adoption Rate |
|---|---|
| For-profit | **~61%** |
| Nonprofit | ~50% |
| Government | **~25%** |

The ownership gap is the starkest demographic divide in the data. For-profit organizations lead, driven by HCA facilities uniformly deploying MyHealthONE and Swellbox across their network. Government hospitals — including large urban safety-net systems like JPS Health Network and Grady Memorial Hospital — trail dramatically despite their scale, with none using a portal as a primary pathway.

### System Affiliation

| Affiliation | Portal Adoption Rate |
|---|---|
| Major system | ~55% |
| Regional system | ~50% |
| Independent | ~45% |

System affiliation is a moderate predictor, but it matters more for *which* portal than *whether* a portal exists. Major systems deploy MyChart or Swellbox uniformly across facilities through enterprise-level procurement, producing consistent (if not always patient-centered) portal experiences. Independents show more vendor diversity and are more likely to use lightweight tools like JotForm or Formstack. Interestingly, independents that do adopt portals show a higher rate of making the portal primary — they tend to fully commit rather than layering a portal onto a legacy PDF workflow.

### Geography

Regional variation is modest. The South leads slightly at ~55% portal adoption, likely reflecting the geographic footprint of HCA, Piedmont, and other large for-profit systems. The West follows at ~51%, with the Midwest (~43%) and Northeast (~44%) slightly behind. Geography appears to be a proxy for ownership and system composition rather than an independent predictor.

## Conclusion: A Transitional Landscape

The portal landscape in 2025 is defined by three tensions:

1. **Presence vs. primacy.** Half of organizations have a portal, but only a fifth make it the front door. For most, the portal supplements rather than replaces the PDF form.

2. **Purpose-built vs. repurposed.** Swellbox/Datavant offers a records-request-specific tool that genuinely streamlines the process; MyChart offers records access as one feature within a general patient portal that rarely replaces the formal ROI authorization workflow. The former is more transformative; the latter is more widespread.

3. **Digital progress vs. digital divide.** Portal adoption correlates with better overall quality scores, but the organizations least likely to adopt — government hospitals and rural critical access hospitals — serve some of the most vulnerable patient populations. The portal trend risks widening access disparities even as it improves the experience for patients at well-resourced facilities.

The PDF form is not dying. It is becoming a fallback — maintained alongside portals by 85% of portal-equipped organizations, still the primary pathway at 75% of all organizations, and the only option at the other half of the healthcare landscape that has not yet adopted any portal at all. For now, the modal patient experience remains: find a PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and fax it back. The portal revolution is underway, but it is far from complete.
