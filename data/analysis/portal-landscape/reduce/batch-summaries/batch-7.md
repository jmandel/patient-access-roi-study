# Portal Landscape: Batch 7 Map Summary

## Prevalence

Of the 190 organizations with completed synthesis data, **58 (31%)** offer some form of online portal or electronic request pathway for medical records. However, only **19 (10%)** treat the portal as their *primary* access pathway—the remaining 39 portal-equipped orgs list it as a secondary option alongside downloadable PDF forms.

The dominant primary pathway remains the generic HIPAA authorization PDF: 142 orgs (75%) rely on a downloadable form as the main mechanism. Seven orgs (4%) offer only phone or in-person request options with no digital pathway at all.

## Vendor Landscape

**Swellbox/Datavant** is the dominant platform, powering portals at **31 of 58 portal orgs (53%)**. These appear as "eRequest wizards" or "Health Record Wizards" branded by the facility. Swellbox's presence spans community hospitals (e.g., Flowers Hospital, Merit Health Central), physician practices (Arizona Community Physicians, The Iowa Clinic), and major health systems (AdventHealth, Ascension facilities).

The remaining market is fragmented:

| Vendor | Count | Example Orgs |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Sharecare/HDS | 4 | Advocare, Gastro Florida, EyeSouth Partners |
| Ciox/HealthMark | 4 | HopeHealth, MUSC Health, SSM Health |
| JotForm | 4 | Rio Grande Hospital, Riverwood Healthcare |
| ChartRequest | 2 | Anaheim Global Medical Center, Minnie Hamilton |
| Formstack | 2 | Labette Health, The Iowa Clinic |
| Verisma | 2 | NewYork-Presbyterian, Southwell/Tift Regional |
| MediCopy | 2 | Southeast Medical Group, Valley Medical Group |
| Others (1 each) | 7 | Luma Health, DocuSign, ChartSwap, ScanSTAT, etc. |

Five portal orgs had unidentifiable vendors. JotForm stands out as an outlier—it's a general-purpose form builder rather than a healthcare-specific ROI platform, used primarily by smaller rural facilities.

## Portal + PDF Coexistence

When a portal exists, a PDF form almost always remains available: **49 of 58 portal orgs (84%)** offer both pathways. Only **9 orgs** have gone portal-only with no downloadable PDF, including AdventHealth Hendersonville, Anaheim Global Medical Center, Labette Health, and Minnie Hamilton Health System. This suggests most organizations view portals as an *addition* to, not a *replacement* for, the traditional form.

Among the 35 orgs where the portal is flagged as the primary pathway, 26 still provide a PDF alternative. Even when the portal leads, PDF persists as a fallback.

## Patterns by Organization Type

**For-profit organizations** adopt portals at roughly double the rate of government-run facilities: 51% (21/41) vs. 17% (4/24). Nonprofits fall in between at 26% (33/125). This likely reflects for-profit orgs' use of third-party ROI vendors like Swellbox/Datavant and Sharecare, which bundle portal functionality with records management services.

**Physician practices** have the highest portal adoption (42%, 11/26), followed by community hospitals (38%, 30/80). Critical access hospitals trail at 17% (5/29), consistent with smaller facilities having fewer resources for digital infrastructure. Teaching hospitals, despite their size, show only 23% portal adoption (7/30)—possibly because they rely on integrated EHR patient portals (e.g., MyChart) that weren't captured as distinct ROI portals.

**System affiliation** shows a gradient: major systems at 35% (23/65), regional systems at 31% (11/36), and independents at 27% (24/89). The gap is modest, suggesting portal adoption is driven more by ROI vendor relationships than system-level digital strategy.

**Regionally**, the South leads at 43% (30/69), well ahead of the Midwest (24%), West (23%), and Northeast (22%). The Southern concentration may reflect the geographic footprint of Swellbox/Datavant's client base.

## Quality Signal

Portal orgs score higher on average: **3.52** overall vs. **3.20** for non-portal orgs. The highest-scoring portal org is Flowers Hospital (4.65, A grade), while the lowest is Anaheim Global Medical Center (2.45, D grade), a portal-only org whose ChartRequest portal apparently didn't compensate for other quality deficits. Having a portal doesn't guarantee a good patient experience, but it correlates with better digital infrastructure overall.
