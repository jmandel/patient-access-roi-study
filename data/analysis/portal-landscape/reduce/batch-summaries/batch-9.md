# Portal and Online Request Landscape — Batch 9

## Overview

Of 190 organizations in the study, **94 (49%)** offer some form of online portal or patient portal pathway for medical records requests. However, only **19 (10%)** list a portal as their **primary pathway type** in the access pathway data — meaning the portal is the main channel patients are directed toward. For the other 75 portal-equipped orgs, the portal is a secondary or supplementary option alongside a traditional PDF authorization form.

## Vendor Landscape

Two platforms dominate overwhelmingly:

| Vendor | Orgs | Primary | Secondary | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Epic MyChart** | 37 | 6 | 31 | Patient portal with records access; rarely the primary ROI pathway |
| **Swellbox/Datavant** | ~30 | 18 | ~12 | Dedicated records-request wizard; most common primary portal |
| ChartRequest | 2 | 2 | 0 | Requires account creation |
| Verisma | 2 | 1 | 1 | Used by NYP and Southwell |
| Sharecare/HDS | 2–3 | 1 | 1–2 | Third-party records platform |
| MRO/Ciox | 2–3 | 1 | 1–2 | ROI fulfillment vendor |
| Other (JotForm, Formstack, DocuSign, Luma Health, MediCopy, athenahealth, etc.) | ~15 | varies | varies | One-off solutions |

The split between MyChart and Swellbox reflects fundamentally different approaches. **MyChart** is a general patient portal where records requests are one feature among many — and hospitals rarely make it the primary ROI channel, instead keeping a downloadable PDF form as the default. **Swellbox/Datavant** is a purpose-built records request wizard; when organizations adopt it, they're three times more likely to make it the primary pathway (18 primary vs. ~12 secondary).

## PDF Form Availability Alongside Portals

Among the 94 portal-equipped organizations, **80 (85%)** still offer a downloadable PDF form alongside the portal. Only **14 organizations** are portal-only with no PDF fallback. Portal-only orgs include AdventHealth Hendersonville, Anaheim Global Medical Center, El Rio Health, Gastro Florida, King's Daughters Medical Center, and several FQHCs like Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center and HopeHealth. The absence of a PDF can be a barrier for patients who lack reliable internet access or prefer paper workflows.

## Portal as Primary vs. Secondary

When portal is marked as the **primary pathway** (42 pathways across orgs, 19 orgs by pathway type classification), Swellbox/Datavant dominates — powering roughly half of all primary-portal configurations. Examples include Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola, Bayshore Medical Center, Piedmont Medical Center, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Epic MyChart appears as primary in only 6 cases (e.g., Boulder Medical Center, El Rio Health, Erie Family Health Centers), despite being the most common portal overall.

Notably, even among portal-primary orgs, only **25 of 94 (27%)** portal-equipped organizations offer a dedicated individual access pathway that distinguishes self-requests from third-party authorizations, and only **20 (21%)** differentiate between self-access and third-party requests at all.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Portal adoption varies significantly across organizational characteristics:

**By facility type**: Physician practices (58%) and FQHCs (56%) lead portal adoption, followed by community hospitals (54%). Teaching hospitals trail at 47%, and critical access hospitals are notably behind at 28% — likely reflecting resource constraints in rural settings.

**By ownership**: For-profit organizations show the highest portal adoption (61%), followed by nonprofits (50%). Government-owned facilities are the least likely to offer a portal (25%), consistent with slower technology adoption in public healthcare settings.

**By system affiliation**: Major health systems (55%) and regional systems (50%) outpace independent organizations (45%), though the gap is narrower than expected. System-affiliated hospitals are more likely to use MyChart (via Epic deployments), while independents show more vendor diversity.

**By region**: No dramatic regional variation emerged; portal adoption is relatively evenly distributed across census regions.

## Key Takeaways

The portal landscape is bifurcated: MyChart is widespread but functions as a passive secondary channel, while Swellbox/Datavant is less common but aggressively positioned as the primary request pathway. The vast majority of portal orgs (85%) maintain a PDF form fallback, which is good for patient choice. The most concerning gap is among critical access hospitals and government facilities, where patients are least likely to find any online request option. Portal presence alone does not guarantee a good patient experience — only about a quarter of portal-equipped orgs differentiate self-access from third-party authorization, suggesting most portals funnel patients through the same generic workflow regardless of request type.
