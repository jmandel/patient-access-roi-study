# Portal & Online Request Landscape — Batch 5 Analysis

## Overview

Across 190 evaluated organizations, **94 (49%)** offer some form of portal or online pathway for patients to request their medical records. This represents a significant but still incomplete shift away from paper-only processes. The remaining 96 organizations rely exclusively on downloadable PDF forms, phone, fax, mail, or in-person requests.

Among the 94 portal-equipped organizations, the portal types break down as follows:

| Portal Category | Count |
|---|---|
| Third-party ROI portal only (e.g., Swellbox) | 38 |
| Patient EHR portal only (e.g., MyChart) | 36 |
| Both an ROI portal and a patient portal | 20 |
| **Total with any portal** | **94** |

## Vendor Landscape

Two platforms dominate. **MyChart (Epic)** appears at 40 organizations, making it the most common patient-portal pathway. **Swellbox (Datavant)** appears at 29 organizations as a dedicated ROI request wizard and is the clear leader among third-party record-release vendors. Other vendors trail far behind:

| Vendor/Platform | Orgs |
|---|---|
| MyChart (Epic) | 40 |
| Swellbox (Datavant) | 29 |
| Ciox/Datavant | 6 |
| Sharecare | 4 |
| Verisma | 2 |
| athenahealth | 2 |
| eClinicalWorks/healow | 1 |
| Medfusion | 1 |
| NextGen | 1 |

A notable pattern: 20 organizations offer *both* a MyChart-style EHR portal and a Swellbox-style ROI vendor portal, creating a dual-channel approach. Examples include Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital, MUSC Health, NewYork-Presbyterian, and Mercy Health facilities. In these cases the ROI portal typically handles formal authorization-based releases while MyChart provides direct patient access to records already in the portal.

Smaller vendors appear as one-offs—ChartRequest, Luma Health, HealthMark Group, MediCopy, Formstack, JotForm, and Zoho—suggesting a fragmented market below the top two.

## Portal as Primary vs. Secondary Pathway

Of the 94 portal-equipped organizations, **42 (45%)** position the portal as the **primary** pathway for requesting records. The remaining 52 list the portal as a secondary or alternative option alongside a PDF form. When the portal is primary, the organization's website typically directs patients to the portal first, with PDF forms mentioned only as fallback or hidden behind collapsible sections.

Examples of portal-primary organizations:
- **AdventHealth Hendersonville** and **Vanderbilt University Medical Center** route patients to Swellbox as the front door
- **Erie Family Health Centers** and **Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania** direct patients to MyChart first
- **NewYork-Presbyterian** uses a dedicated Verisma portal with a "Patient" link
- **Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital** buries its PDF form in a collapsed section, steering patients toward MRO Express

## PDF Coexistence

Among portal-equipped organizations, **80 of 94 (85%)** still maintain a downloadable PDF form alongside the portal. Only 14 portal organizations have abandoned PDF forms entirely—meaning the portal is the *only* available pathway. These PDF-less organizations include King's Daughters Medical Center (Swellbox only), Gastro Florida (Sharecare only), and El Rio Health (MyChart with phone fallback). The strong coexistence of PDF and portal suggests that portals supplement rather than replace traditional forms for most organizations.

## Patterns by Organization Type

Portal adoption varies meaningfully across organizational characteristics:

**By ownership**: For-profit organizations lead at **61%** portal adoption, compared to 50% for nonprofits and only **25% for government** hospitals. The government gap is striking—these facilities may face procurement or technology barriers.

**By facility type**: FQHCs (56%) and physician practices (58%) have the highest portal adoption, followed by community hospitals (54%). Critical access hospitals trail at **28%**, likely reflecting resource constraints at small rural facilities. Teaching hospitals fall in the middle at 47%.

**By system affiliation**: Major systems (55%) and regional systems (50%) adopt portals more than independents (45%), though the gap is modest. System affiliation matters more for *which* portal—system-affiliated hospitals are more likely to use MyChart or a system-wide Swellbox contract.

## Notable Observations

**The Swellbox/Datavant consolidation**: Swellbox, Ciox, and Datavant are related entities, and together they appear at 35+ organizations. Combined with their role behind several white-labeled portals, Datavant may be the single largest vendor in the ROI portal space.

**Dual-portal complexity**: The 20 organizations offering both an ROI vendor portal and an EHR patient portal create a confusing landscape for patients. At Boulder Medical Center, records before September 2024 go through Swellbox while newer records require MyChart Sharing Hub—splitting the experience by date.

**Portal ≠ better access**: Several portal-primary organizations still impose friction. Anaheim Global Medical Center and Minnie Hamilton Health System both require account creation before patients can even see the authorization process—a portal can be a barrier when it gates access behind registration that a simple PDF download does not require.

**Online submission is widespread**: Even among non-portal organizations, 152 of 190 (80%) accept online submission in some form—email, fax-to-email, or embedded widgets. The distinction matters: many organizations accept emailed PDFs without offering a dedicated request portal.
