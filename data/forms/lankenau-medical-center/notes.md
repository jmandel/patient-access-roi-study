# Lankenau Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Lankenau Medical Center
- **Website**: https://www.mainlinehealth.org/locations/lankenau-medical-center
- **Parent System**: Main Line Health (regional nonprofit system in suburban Philadelphia)
- **Location**: Wynnewood, PA

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search** for `Lankenau Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found a direct PDF link on the Main Line Health website.
2. **Web search** for `Main Line Health "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` — confirmed the same form and found a second URL variant.
3. **Web search** for `site:mainlinehealth.org authorization release medical records` — found the medical records patient services page and both PDF URLs.

The form was easy to find. Main Line Health publishes it prominently and it appeared in the first search result. The parent system (Main Line Health) manages the form centrally for all its facilities including Lankenau.

- **PDF version**: 1.6
- **Description**: Appears to be the same or a very similar version of the Main Line Health "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form. Same content and structure as form-1.pdf but significantly smaller file size, suggesting a different export/optimization. Same text content extracted by pdftotext.

## Difficulties
- **None significant**. The form was straightforward to find via web search. Both URLs worked without bot blocking or authentication requirements.
- The two URLs appear to host the same (or nearly identical) form content, possibly different versions or optimizations of the same document.

## Key Observations

- The form supports **patient personal use** as a purpose option and offers multiple **electronic delivery options** (encrypted USB, MyChart, encrypted email).
- Authorization expires in **12 months** unless otherwise specified.
- The form references **PA state law** and acknowledges potential fees for record copies.
