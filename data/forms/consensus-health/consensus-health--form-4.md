## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)** — a HIPAA-required informational document describing how Consensus Health uses and discloses patients' Protected Health Information. It is branded "©Consensus Health" and marked "Proprietary & Confidential" on every page, with an identifier of "CMG Form 7 - Version 2.0." It appears to be a 2025 update.

This is **not** a Release of Information form. It is a passive informational notice, not a patient-initiated authorization or request form. Of the four documents found for Consensus Health, none is a dedicated patient-access ROI form:
- **form-1.pdf**: Generic (unbranded) "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" from PatientPop — the closest to an ROI form
- **form-2.pdf**: Consensus Health–branded "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization Form" — an intake consent, not a records request
- **form-3.pdf**: "HIPAA Acknowledgement" — a one-page receipt acknowledgment for this very NPP
- **form-4.pdf** (this document): The Notice of Privacy Practices itself

This document is the companion piece to form-3.pdf; patients sign form-3 to acknowledge receipt of this notice. Together with form-2, these constitute the intake paperwork for a Consensus Health practice visit. None of these serve as a mechanism for a patient to request their own records.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This document was **not findable on the main Consensus Health website** (consensushealth.com). It was located on the Skylands Medical Group website (a Consensus Health member practice) at a WordPress upload path. Per the retrieval notes, the main Consensus Health site has no patient forms section, no downloadable documents, and no medical records request page. Extensive URL guessing and site-specific searches returned nothing.

The file URL — `wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CMG-Form-Notice-of-Privacy-2025.pdf` — is descriptively named and suggests a December 2024 upload of a 2025-dated notice. However, the URL is on a third-party member practice's site, not on Consensus Health's own domain. A patient visiting consensushealth.com or the Cherry Hill practice site (consensuscherryhill.com) would have no path to finding this document.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present and fully extractable (21,789 characters across 7 pages). Not an image-only scan.

**Fillable fields:** Zero (0). This is appropriate for an informational notice — no patient input is expected.

**File format:** 176 KB for 7 pages with 14 embedded images (likely logos or headers) and 6 fonts. The file size is reasonable for the content.

**Digital design:** The document appears to be a natively digital PDF rather than a scanned paper form. Text is cleanly rendered, and the embedded images are likely decorative brand elements. The document reads well as a digital artifact and could be printed without loss.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** Seven pages covering: (A) commitment to privacy, (B) 16 enumerated categories of permitted uses/disclosures, (C) prohibited uses (reproductive health care), (D) authorization requirements, (E) patient privacy rights (7 enumerated rights), (E — repeated letter) other activities (marketing, sale, fundraising, incidental uses, business associates), and (F) complaint process. This is a standard length for a comprehensive NPP.

**Clarity:** The language is formal but generally accessible. Key terms are defined — e.g., "Protected Health Information" or "PHI" is information about you, including demographic information, that may identify you." Individual sections use illustrative examples, such as: "For example, we may disclose your PHI to another physician who may be treating you or to whom you have been referred." The reproductive health care section (Section C) is notably detailed and appears to reflect the 2024 HIPAA Reproductive Health Care Final Rule.

**Organization:** The document follows a logical HIPAA-standard structure (commitment → uses/disclosures → patient rights → complaints). Sections are lettered A through F, with numbered subsections. However, the letter "E" is used twice — once for "Your Privacy Rights" and again for "Other Activities Involving the Use and Disclosure of Your PHI" — which is a structural error.

**Layout:** The document uses clear section headers and numbered lists. The text is dense in places but not unusually so for a legal-regulatory document. No visual aids, tables, or highlighted callouts are used to draw attention to patient rights.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**As a records access tool:** This document does **not** serve patients trying to access their records. It is an informational notice, not a request mechanism. However, it does describe the right to access records under Section E.1 ("Inspect and copy"), stating: "In most cases, you have the right to look at or get copies of your PHI that we maintain, but you must make the request in writing."

**Access rights language:** The NPP describes the right to inspect and copy, including electronic access: "you have the right to access your PHI in an electronic format (to the extent we maintain the information in such a format) and to direct us to send the e-record directly to a third-party." This is a positive inclusion.

**Fee language:** The document states: "If you request a copy of your information, we may charge you reasonable fees for the costs of copying, mailing or other costs incurred by us in complying with your request." It also notes: "We may charge for the labor costs to transfer the information; and charge for the costs of electronic media if you request that we provide you with such media." The phrasing is vague — it does not specify amounts or cite HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations.

**No instructions for requesting records:** The NPP tells patients they have the right to request their records but provides no practical guidance — no form to use, no address to send requests to (other than the Privacy Officer contact at the end), and no mention of the patient portal as a records access pathway. A patient reading this would know they have rights but not how to exercise them.

**Minor access restriction noted:** The document includes a parenthetical note about minors: "If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, certain portions of the minor's records may not be accessible to you." This is legally accurate for New Jersey.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**30-day response commitment:** The document states: "We will respond to you within 30 days after receiving your written request," which aligns with the HIPAA standard (with possible 30-day extension).

**Written request requirement:** The document requires records requests "in writing" — "you must make the request in writing." This is permissible under HIPAA but no form is provided or referenced.

**Summary-in-lieu option:** The NPP states: "Instead of providing the PHI you requested, we may provide you with a summary or explanation of the PHI as long as you agree to that and to the cost in advance." This is a valid HIPAA provision.

**Denial rights described:** The document acknowledges that requests may be denied in certain situations and commits to written explanation of denials and the right to have denials reviewed "when applicable."

**Restriction on self-pay disclosures:** The document correctly notes the patient's right to restrict disclosure to health plans for self-pay services: "You have the right to ask us to restrict the disclosure of your PHI to your health plan for a service we provide to you where you have directly paid us (out of pocket, in full) for that service, in which case we are required to honor your request."

**Reproductive health care protections:** Section C includes a detailed prohibition on using PHI "for the purpose of conducting a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into, or imposing criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating Reproductive Health Care that is or was lawful under the circumstances it was provided." This reflects the 2024 HIPAA Reproductive Health Care Final Rule and includes the attestation requirement for certain disclosures.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Fee language is vague.** The document mentions "reasonable fees" and charges for "labor costs to transfer" and "costs of electronic media" but provides no specific amounts, no fee schedule reference, and no citation to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitations under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4). A patient cannot determine in advance what they would be charged.
- **No practical records request pathway.** The NPP describes the right to inspect and copy records but does not tell patients *how* to make a request — no form is referenced, no specific submission address (beyond the Privacy Officer at the end), no mention of the athenahealth patient portal, and no email or fax number for requests.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Duplicate section letter "E."** Section E is used twice: first for "Your Privacy Rights" (page 4) and again for "Other Activities Involving the Use and Disclosure of Your PHI" (page 6). The second should be labeled something other than "E" (likely "F," with the complaint section becoming "G"). This is a formatting/editing error.
- **"Proprietary & Confidential" marking on a public notice.** Every page footer reads "Proprietary & Confidential" — an odd designation for a document that HIPAA requires be made publicly available to patients. This marking could confuse patients about whether they are permitted to share or retain copies of the notice.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Reproductive health care protections.** The document includes a substantive and well-written section on reproductive health care PHI protections, reflecting the 2024 HIPAA Final Rule. This is more detailed than many NPPs and specifically addresses the attestation requirement for disclosures potentially related to reproductive health care. This demonstrates the organization keeping current with regulatory changes.
- **Electronic access rights acknowledged.** The NPP explicitly states patients' right to access PHI "in an electronic format" and to "direct us to send the e-record directly to a third-party," which many NPPs omit or bury.
