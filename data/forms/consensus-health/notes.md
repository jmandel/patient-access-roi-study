## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI form** — Searched for `"Consensus Health" Marlton NJ release of information authorization medical records form`. No Consensus Health–specific ROI form found.

2. **Website navigation** — Explored consensushealth.com pages: homepage, For Patients, Privacy Policy, About Us, Contact. No patient forms section or downloadable forms found on the main site.

3. **URL guessing** — Tried common paths (`/patient-forms/`, `/forms/`, `/medical-records/`, `/hipaa/`, `/authorization-form/`, `/compliance/`) on both consensushealth.com and consensuscherryhill.com. All returned 404.

4. **Site-specific search** — Searched `site:consensushealth.com` for forms, authorization, records. No results.

5. **PDF file search** — Searched `consensushealth.com filetype:pdf`. Found only Code of Ethics and Conduct PDFs and a Benefits Summary — no patient-facing forms.

6. **Cherry Hill practice site** — Navigated https://consensuscherryhill.com/ (the Marlton-area practice). Checked Patients page, Privacy Policy. No downloadable forms; only contact form and patient portal link.

7. **Skylands Medical Group** — Found https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/ (a Consensus Health member practice). Their Patient Resources page has multiple Consensus Health–branded patient forms, including a "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization" form.

8. **PatientPop search** — Found a generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" form hosted on PatientPop servers, linked in web search results about Consensus Health practices.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/223399.pdf
- **Description:** Generic "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" — 1 page, has text layer, no fillable fields. Not branded to Consensus Health. Found via web search associated with Consensus Health practices. Contains fields for patient info, information requested, purpose of release, and recipient. Includes HIPAA authorization language at bottom.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CMG-Form-Consent-Disclosure-and-Authorization-2022.pdf
- **Description:** "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization Form" — 2 pages, has text layer, Consensus Health branded. From Skylands Medical Group (a Consensus Health member practice). Covers general consent for treatment, acknowledgment of HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, consent to use/disclose PHI for treatment/payment/operations, designation of authorized individuals for PHI disclosure, and contact preferences. Form identifier: CMG Form 5/Version 1.0 (04/2019). This is more of a general treatment consent and PHI disclosure authorization than a patient-initiated ROI form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CMG-Form-HIPAA-Acknowledgement-2022.pdf
- **Description:** "HIPAA Acknowledgement — Notice of Privacy Practices" — 1 page, has text layer, Consensus Health branded. Simple acknowledgment of receipt of Notice of Privacy Practices. Form identifier: CMG Form 6/Version 1.0 (04/2019).

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CMG-Form-Notice-of-Privacy-2025.pdf
- **Description:** "Notice of Privacy Practices" — 7 pages, has text layer, Consensus Health branded. Comprehensive HIPAA notice covering uses/disclosures of PHI, patient rights, and contact information. Form identifier: CMG Form 7 - Version 2.0. Updated 2025 version.

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **No ROI form on main website.** The main consensushealth.com site has no patient forms section whatsoever. The "For Patients" page only describes benefits and links to the patient portal.

2. **Decentralized practice model.** Consensus Health operates as a network of independent practices. Patient forms appear to be published by individual member practices (e.g., Skylands Medical Group) rather than centrally by Consensus Health.

3. **No specific ROI/records request form.** Neither the main site nor the Skylands practice site offers a form specifically designed for patients to request their own medical records. The closest document is the general "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization" form (form-2.pdf), which authorizes the practice to use and disclose PHI but is signed at intake — not a patient-initiated records request form.

4. **Cherry Hill/Marlton practice has no forms online.** The practice closest to Marlton (consensuscherryhill.com) has no downloadable forms; they direct patients to the athenahealth patient portal or ask them to contact the office.

## Summary

Consensus Health does not appear to publish a patient-initiated Release of Information / Authorization for Medical Records form on any of its public-facing websites. The organization relies on its athenahealth patient portal for patient interactions and does not make ROI forms available for download. The most relevant form found is the general "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization" form (form-2.pdf) from a member practice, which is a treatment consent and general PHI disclosure authorization, not a records request form.
