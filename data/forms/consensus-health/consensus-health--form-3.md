# Evaluation: Consensus Health — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3 is titled **"HIPAA Acknowledgement — Notice of Privacy Practices."** It is a simple, one-page acknowledgment form (CMG Form 6/Version 1.0, dated 04/2019) in which the patient confirms receipt of Consensus Health's Notice of Privacy Practices. It is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) or Authorization form — it serves a purely administrative function at intake.

This document is one of four forms retrieved for Consensus Health. The others include:
- **form-1.pdf**: A generic, unbranded "Authorization for Release of Medical Records" found on PatientPop servers — the closest thing to an ROI form, but not Consensus Health–branded.
- **form-2.pdf**: "Consent, Disclosure and Authorization Form" (CMG Form 5) — a broader treatment consent and PHI disclosure authorization, also not a patient-initiated records request.
- **form-4.pdf**: The full "Notice of Privacy Practices" (CMG Form 7, Version 2.0, updated 2025) — the companion document that form-3 acknowledges receipt of.

Form-3 is essentially the signature page confirming the patient received form-4. It has no relevance to a patient attempting to request their own medical records.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **not findable on the main Consensus Health website** (consensushealth.com). It was discovered only on a member practice's website — Skylands Medical Group (skylandsmedicalgroup.com) — under their Patient Resources section. The source URL is:

`https://www.skylandsmedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CMG-Form-HIPAA-Acknowledgement-2022.pdf`

The main Consensus Health site has no patient forms section, no downloadable documents, and no medical records request pathway. The Cherry Hill/Marlton practice site (consensuscherryhill.com) similarly offers no forms. Multiple search strategies — web searches, URL guessing, site-specific searches, PDF file type searches — all failed to locate any patient-facing forms on Consensus Health's own domains.

A patient looking specifically for a HIPAA acknowledgment form would have essentially no chance of finding this independently. However, since this is an intake form typically completed in-office, findability online is less critical than it would be for an ROI form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The full document text is extractable (1,270 characters), making it searchable and screen-reader accessible.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. All fields are static underlines intended for handwriting. There are no interactive form fields.
- **File size**: 71 KB for a single page — reasonable, though there are no embedded images and 6 fonts are used, suggesting some overhead from font embedding.
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is clearly designed as a print-and-sign paper form. The blank lines (rendered as long sequences of underscores in the text layer) are designed for pen-and-paper completion.
- **Format**: PDF with text layer, not a scan. The document appears to be generated from a word processor, not scanned from paper.

The form is technically functional as a document but offers no digital-first affordances — no fillable fields, no electronic signature capability, no option for digital completion.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The form is minimal — one page with only a few fields:

**Patient section (2 fields):**
- Printed Name of Patient
- Patient Date of Birth

**Acknowledgment statement (1 line):**
> "I acknowledge receipt of Consensus Health's Notice of Privacy Practices."

**Signature area (2 fields):**
- Signature of Patient/Legal Representative
- Date

**Office Use section (3 fields):**
- Reason (why signature was not obtained)
- Signature of Consensus Representative
- Printed Name and Date

The language is clear and concise. The single-sentence acknowledgment ("I acknowledge receipt of Consensus Health's Notice of Privacy Practices") is plain and unambiguous. The "Office Use" section appropriately addresses the HIPAA requirement (45 CFR § 164.520(c)(2)(ii)) to document good-faith efforts when a patient's acknowledgment cannot be obtained — the form instructs: "To be completed only if no signature is obtained. If it is not possible to obtain the individual's acknowledgement, describe the good faith efforts made to obtain the individual's acknowledgement, and the reason why the acknowledgement was not obtained."

The layout is clean with adequate whitespace for a single-page form. Visual separation between the patient section and office-use section is provided by a row of asterisks ("***************").

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This form has **no relevance to patient records access**. It is an administrative intake document confirming the patient received the privacy practices notice. It does not:
- Enable patients to request their own records
- Reference HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524)
- Offer scope, format, or delivery options for records
- Mention electronic health information or patient portals
- Provide any information about how to request medical records

A patient looking for a way to obtain their health records would find nothing useful in this document.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

As a HIPAA acknowledgment form, this document is compliant with the basic requirement to obtain written acknowledgment of receipt of the Notice of Privacy Practices. The "Office Use" section appropriately accounts for situations where a signature cannot be obtained, aligning with 45 CFR § 164.520(c)(2)(ii).

The form does not impose any unreasonable barriers — it simply asks for a name, date of birth, and signature. However, it is exclusively paper-based with no digital submission option.

The form version (04/2019) is somewhat dated, though since it references the companion Notice of Privacy Practices (form-4, which was updated to Version 2.0 in 2025), the acknowledgment form itself may not require frequent updates.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Legal Representative" without guidance**: The signature line reads "Signature of Patient/Legal Representative" but provides no field or instruction for documenting the representative's relationship to the patient or basis of authority. Form-2 (the Consent form from the same suite) does include fields for "Authorized Individual (Parent/Guardian) Name" and "Basis of Authority" — this form lacks that detail.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Version dating mismatch**: This form (CMG Form 6/Version 1.0, dated 04/2019) has not been updated since its initial release, while the companion Notice of Privacy Practices it acknowledges (CMG Form 7) has been updated to Version 2.0 with a 2025 date. Though not a functional error, the stale version number may create confusion about whether the acknowledgment form aligns with the current notice.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **"Office Use" section for documenting good-faith efforts**: The form includes a well-designed section for staff to document why a patient's acknowledgment could not be obtained, directly addressing the HIPAA requirement. This is a practical compliance feature that many similar forms omit.
