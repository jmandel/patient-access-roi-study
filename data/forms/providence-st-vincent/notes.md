# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Providence St. Vincent Medical Center
- **Location**: Portland, OR
- **Website**: https://www.providence.org/locations/or/st-vincent-medical-center
- **Parent System**: Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH) — major nonprofit health system operating across AK, CA, MT, NM, OR, TX, WA

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for organization-specific form**: Searched for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center Portland Oregon authorization release health information form PDF". This did not return a facility-specific form but pointed to the parent system (Providence) forms.

2. **Web search for parent system forms**: Searched for "Providence health system medical records release form authorization PDF". Found the OR/MT authorization form directly linked from Providence's website.

3. **Site-specific search**: Searched "site:providence.org authorization release medical records form". Found the main medical records authorization page and the OR/MT-specific authorization PDF.

4. **Navigating the Providence HIM page**: Fetched https://www.providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management which listed multiple forms including the "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" form — a newer, patient-access-specific form.

5. **Additional search for Oregon-specific forms**: Found an older OR/MT-specific "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" form.

## What Worked
- Providence publishes ROI forms at the system level, not per-facility. Searching for the parent system was essential.
- The Health Information Management page (https://www.providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management) was the most comprehensive source, listing multiple forms and detailed instructions.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.providence.org/-/media/project/psjh/shared/files/roi/english-psjh-patient-request-for-access.pdf
- **File size**: 96,585 bytes (97 KB)
- **Pages**: 2 (based on text content)
- **What it is**: "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" — a newer PSJH-wide patient access form. Specifically designed for patients requesting their own records (or disclosing to a named recipient). Includes options for record format (MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, Fax), record type checkboxes, date range, and sensitive information categories requiring initials. Updated contact info references R1RCM (outsourced ROI vendor). Form number 940507 (3/27/25).

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.providence.org/-/media/project/psjh/shared/files/roi/or-mt-access-designated-record-set.pdf
- **File size**: 754,824 bytes (755 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **What it is**: "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" — an older OR/MT-specific patient access form. Similar to form-2 but with older contact information (PH&S instead of PSJH, different phone/fax/email). Includes state selection checkboxes (AK, CA, MT, WA, OR), delivery options, record type selection. Revision date 03/20. Larger file size suggests it may contain embedded images or different compression.

## Difficulties
- No facility-specific form exists for St. Vincent Medical Center; all forms are at the Providence system level.
- Providence has multiple overlapping forms: a general authorization (form-1) and patient-access-specific forms (form-2, form-3), with form-2 appearing to be the newer replacement for form-3.
- The HIM page notes that ROI is now handled centrally (not on-site at facilities) through a third-party vendor (R1RCM).

## Key Observations
- Providence offers **three distinct forms**: a general ROI authorization and two generations of patient-access-specific forms.
- All forms include **fillable PDF fields** and **text layers** — they are not image-only scans.
- All forms offer **multiple delivery formats** including MyChart, email, fax, paper, and disc.
- The forms cover **multiple states** via checkbox selection rather than having state-specific versions.
- Providence has centralized ROI processing to a single PO Box in Portland, OR 97208.
