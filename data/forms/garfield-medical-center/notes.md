## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ahmchealth.com/gmc/documents/GMC-AUTHORIZATION-FOR-USE-OR-DISCLOSURE-OF-PHI.pdf
- **HTTP Status:** 200
- **File Size:** 271,120 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **PDF Version:** 1.4
- **Document Type:** ROI / Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information
- **Description:** Two-page authorization form specific to Garfield Medical Center. Includes patient information, release-to section, purpose checkboxes (insurance, personal use, continuing care, legal, other), detailed record type selection (H&P, discharge summary, operative report, lab, radiology, etc.), special authorization for sensitive information (mental health), signature/date fields, and California Health and Safety Code fee references. Has text layer; appears to be a digitally-created form rather than a scan.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ahmchealth.com/gmc/docs/Patient_Authorization_Form_for_Medical_Records.pdf
- **HTTP Status:** 200
- **File Size:** 92,735 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **PDF Version:** 1.5
- **Document Type:** ROI / Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information
- **Description:** Very similar to form-1.pdf — same general structure and content, with minor layout differences (field ordering, spacing). Also a Garfield Medical Center-specific authorization form. Smaller file size, slightly different PDF version. Likely an older or alternate version of the same form hosted at a different URL path (`/docs/` vs `/documents/`).

## Difficulties
- None significant. Both forms were easily found via web search and downloaded without issues (no bot blocking, no login required).
- The two forms are very similar but not identical — minor layout differences suggest they may be different versions maintained at different URL paths.

## Summary
Two versions of Garfield Medical Center's ROI authorization form were found and downloaded. Both are digitally-created PDFs with text layers, specific to GMC, and cover standard authorization fields including record type selection, purpose, and California fee disclosures.
