# Evaluation: Hartford Hospital — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3.pdf is the Hartford HealthCare system-wide "Authorization to Disclose/Obtain Health Information" (form number HH Forms 571559 Rev. 11-2022). It is a 2-page PDF (453 KB) hosted on the Hartford HealthCare Medical Group website at `https://hartfordhealthcaremedicalgroup.org/file%20library/forms/medical-records-release-form.pdf`.

This form is **textually identical** to form-1.pdf, which is the same form 571559 hosted on the main Hartford HealthCare site. The two files differ only slightly in file size (453 KB vs 449 KB), likely due to encoding differences. Form-2.pdf is a distinct, older Institute of Living–specific variant (form 573008, Rev. 05/12) tailored to that psychiatric facility. Form-3 is therefore a duplicate copy of the system-wide standard form, distributed through a different web property (the medical group's site rather than the parent system site).

The form is designed as a **general-purpose authorization** covering both disclosure and obtaining of records. It is not specifically a patient-access form — it serves third-party release equally. The header includes internal tracking fields ("MR#", "Date Completed", "Pages Copied", "Initials") oriented toward HIM staff processing, and the form number *104507 appears as a barcode identifier.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Moderate findability.** According to the retrieval notes, this copy was found via web search results pointing to the Hartford HealthCare Medical Group site. The main system's medical records page at `hartfordhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/patients/medical-records` provides a well-organized landing page with direct links to the authorization form — but that link points to form-1, not this copy.

The URL for form-3 (`hartfordhealthcaremedicalgroup.org/file%20library/forms/medical-records-release-form.pdf`) has a reasonably descriptive filename ("medical-records-release-form.pdf"), which is more intuitive than form-1's numeric filename ("571559.pdf"). However, the existence of the same form hosted on multiple domains (hartfordhealthcare.org vs. hartfordhealthcaremedicalgroup.org) creates version-management risk. The notes also document a deprecated URL that returns a 404, suggesting the organization has struggled with link stability over time.

A patient searching specifically for "Hartford HealthCare Medical Group medical records release form" would find this copy. A patient starting at the main Hartford Hospital website would more likely encounter form-1.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The full text is extractable (7,945 characters), and the document is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero (0)**. Despite being a native digital PDF (not a scan), the form has no interactive form fields. All blanks are rendered as static underscores. Patients must print, hand-fill, and submit physically — or use a PDF annotation tool.
- **File size**: 453 KB for 2 pages with no embedded images is somewhat large, suggesting embedded fonts or other overhead, but not problematic.
- **Font count**: 13 fonts are used, which is high for a 2-page form and may indicate design complexity.
- **Digital-first design**: No. The form was clearly designed for print-and-fill workflow. The checkbox fields are non-interactive Unicode characters, underscored blank lines require handwriting, and there's no submit button or electronic submission pathway embedded in the document.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Page 1** is the authorization form proper. **Page 2** contains legally required notices about special categories of information (HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, and reproductive health care services).

**Length**: Two pages is appropriate for a system-wide authorization covering multiple facility types and special information categories.

**Organization**: The form follows a generally logical flow: patient identification → source/destination of disclosure → method of disclosure → record types → purpose → expiration/rights → signature. However, the single "FILL OUT BELOW TO DISCLOSE/OBTAIN" section conflates two different directions of information flow (sending vs. receiving) into one set of fields, with "I authorize _____ to disclose /obtain health information to: ______" — which could confuse patients about who is sending and who is receiving.

**Record type options**: The form offers a granular set of ~18 record type checkboxes including "Abstract of Record," "Entire Record," "Billing Records," "History & Physical," "Consultations," "Laboratory Reports," "Discharge/Transfer Summary," "ED Record," "MyChart Plus Enrollment," "Operative Reports," "Pathology Reports," "Progress Reports," "Psychiatric Evaluation," "Psych/Neuro Testing," "Radiology Films," "Radiology Reports," "Treatment Plan," and "Other." Four sensitive categories are broken out with separate checkboxes at the top: "Reproductive Healthcare Services," "Mental Health Record," "Substance Abuse Records," and "HIV-Related Information."

**Layout**: The form is dense but reasonably organized. The 11 facility addresses with fax numbers listed under "Authorization can be sent to:" consume significant real estate but are functional — patients need to know where to send the completed form. The destination list includes Backus, Charlotte Hungerford, Hartford Healthcare at Home, HH/IOL, HOCC, MidState, Natchaug, Rushford, St. Vincent-Behavioral, Windham, and HHCMG.

**Clarity**: The authorization language is moderately legalistic. The opening sentence — "Subject to the statements printed on the back, I, the undersigned patient or legal representative, hereby authorize the use and disclosure of health information including, if applicable, information relating to the diagnosis or treatment of mental illness, drug and/or alcohol abuse, HIV related information, and reproductive services" — is a long, multi-clause sentence that may challenge low-literacy readers.

**Page 2 legal notices**: The four blocks of legal text (HIV, Psychiatric, Drug/Alcohol, Reproductive Health) use inconsistent capitalization — some lines randomly capitalize mid-sentence (e.g., "Prohibits you from making," "Permitted by the written consent," "Any use of the information"). This appears to be a formatting artifact rather than intentional emphasis.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting records. The same form serves both purposes. There is no simplified pathway or separate form for patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access. The purpose field lists "At the request of the patient" as one checkbox option alongside "Medical," "Legal," "Disability," and "Insurance" — but this is marked "(Optional)."

**Scope options**: Good. Patients can specify date ranges and select from a comprehensive list of record types. The "Entire Record" option is available for those wanting everything.

**Delivery method options**: The form lists seven methods: "Mail," "Verbal," "Pick-up," "Review," "Electronic," "MyChart Plus," and "Fax." The inclusion of "Electronic" and "MyChart Plus" as delivery options is positive, though the form provides no detail on what "Electronic" means in practice (email? portal? secure file transfer?).

**Right of Access language**: The form includes the standard statement "I understand that I may inspect or copy the information to be used or disclosed" and "I understand that my treatment or continued treatment is in no way conditioned on whether or not I sign this authorization and that I may refuse to sign it." However, there is **no explicit reference to HIPAA § 164.524**, the Right of Access rule, or patient rights language beyond the basic non-conditioning statement.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or TEFCA.

**Fees**: No fee schedule or fee mention appears on the form. This is neutral — it neither sets expectations nor creates upfront barriers.

**Revocation**: The form states "I may revoke this authorization at any time by notifying Patient Relations in writing."

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: "This authorization will expire (date) __________. If date is not completed, this authorization will expire one year from the date of signature below." A one-year default expiration is reasonable and standard.

**No notarization or witness requirement**: The form requires only the patient's (or representative's) signature. No notarization is required, and no witness signature line appears (unlike the Institute of Living variant in form-2, which includes a witness line).

**Representative authority**: The form lists relationship options including "Self," "Parent," "Guardian," "Conservator," "Power of Attorney," "Administrator / Executor of Estate," and "Documented Next of Kin." It instructs: "If signed by the legal Representative, attach appropriate documentation to verify authority." This is standard.

**Minor consent**: "Legal guardian must sign this authorization if the patient is a minor. Minors receiving drug abuse, mental health, venereal disease treatment may sign their own authorization." This correctly reflects Connecticut law allowing minors to consent for certain sensitive treatments.

**Submission**: The form lists 11 facility HIM departments with physical addresses and fax numbers. There is **no email address, no web portal URL, and no online submission option** provided. Patients must either fax the form or mail/deliver it in person to the appropriate facility.

**Purpose field marked "(Optional)"**: The form correctly marks the purpose of disclosure as optional, which aligns with HIPAA requirements that patients need not justify their access requests.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Disclose/obtain" conflation**: The form's single field structure — "I authorize _____ to disclose /obtain health information to: ______" — asks patients to fill in one set of fields for two opposite directions of information flow. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should write Hartford Hospital's name in the first blank and their own name in the second, or vice versa. The slash construction "disclose /obtain" (with inconsistent spacing) adds to the confusion.

- **"Electronic" delivery undefined**: The checkbox for "Electronic" delivery is listed without any explanation of what this means. Patients have no way to know whether selecting this will result in email, a portal download, a CD, or something else. There's also no field to provide an email address.

- **"MyChart Plus Enrollment"** appears both as a delivery method checkbox and as a record type checkbox. It's unclear whether checking it as a record type means the patient is requesting enrollment in the portal, or requesting records about their portal enrollment.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Inconsistent capitalization on page 2**: The legal notice text has random mid-sentence capitalization (e.g., "Prohibits," "Permitted," "Any use," "The specific written consent," "Authorization"). This appears throughout the psychiatric, substance abuse, and reproductive health notice blocks and makes the text appear poorly proofread.

- **Typo in psychiatric notice**: "If the event that information released constitutes" should read "In the event" — "If" is used instead of "In." This same error appears in the reproductive health services notice block.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Comprehensive facility directory**: Listing all 11 HHC facility HIM departments with addresses and fax numbers on the form itself means patients don't need to make a separate call to find out where to send the authorization. The checkbox format makes it easy to route to the correct facility.

- **Sensitive information opt-in**: Breaking out HIV, mental health, substance abuse, and reproductive health records as separate opt-in checkboxes — with corresponding legal notices on page 2 — gives patients granular control over the most sensitive categories of information. This reflects careful attention to Connecticut-specific privacy requirements.

- **Purpose marked optional**: Explicitly labeling the purpose field "(Optional)" correctly implements the HIPAA principle that patients need not justify their access requests.
