# Hartford Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Hartford Hospital
- **Website:** https://hartfordhospital.org
- **Location:** Hartford, CT
- **Parent System:** Hartford HealthCare (regional system, nonprofit)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Hartford Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — returned multiple direct PDF links across Hartford HealthCare domains.
2. **Web search** for `Hartford Hospital Connecticut "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same forms and pointed to the parent system's medical records page.
3. **Navigated** Hartford HealthCare's medical records page at `https://hartfordhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/patients/medical-records` — found the canonical links under "Release of Information forms" heading.

The parent system (Hartford HealthCare) manages ROI centrally. The medical records page on hartfordhealthcare.org is the main landing page, with links to all facility-specific HIM departments and a single system-wide authorization form.

## Difficulties

- The URL `https://hartfordhealthcare.org/-/media/files/patients-visitors/patients/hhc-authorization-to-release-form-english.pdf` returned a **404 page** (HTML). This appears to be an older/deprecated URL that search results still reference.
- The correct current URL for the system-wide form is `https://hartfordhealthcare.org/file%20library/forms/571559.pdf`.
