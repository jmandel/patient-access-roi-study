### 5. JavaScript Page Analysis
- Used JavaScript on the homepage to search for all PDF links — found none

## Observations
- NHA has a medical records department (phone extensions 1547/1524 and fax 419.259.4503) but does not provide any downloadable forms on their website
- The website is primarily informational — services, locations, appointments, and community outreach
- They use FollowMyHealth as their patient portal (https://nhainc.followmyhealth.com/)
- The only downloadable PDFs found on the site were: employment application and sliding fee schedule/application
- As an FQHC, NHA serves a vulnerable population; the lack of online forms means patients must visit or call to obtain the ROI form
- The services page mentions "the development of forms in both English and Spanish" suggesting forms exist but are only provided in-person

## Downloaded Forms
None — no ROI or authorization form is publicly available on the NHA website.
