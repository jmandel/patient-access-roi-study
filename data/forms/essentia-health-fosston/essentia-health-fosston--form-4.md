## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an **Authorization to Verbally Discuss Protected Health Information** — a form that grants Essentia Health permission to *verbally share* a patient's medical and billing information with designated individuals (family, friends, caregivers). It is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) form. It does not authorize the release of copies of medical records.

The form explicitly distinguishes itself from the ROI form. Page 2 includes the FAQ: "Can the person I designate also get copies of my medical records? No, they can only receive verbal information. To get copies of medical records, you must complete a separate Authorization for Use and Disclosure form available at your treating facility."

Among the four forms found for Essentia Health-Fosston:
- **form-1.pdf**: The primary ROI authorization form (EH10843) — the document a patient would use to request record copies.
- **form-2.pdf**: MyChart Access Self-Authorization (EH2931) — for patient portal enrollment.
- **form-3.pdf**: Adult Patient Proxy Authorization for MyChart — proxy portal access (image-only, no text layer).
- **form-4.pdf** (this document): Verbal authorization for information sharing with designated persons.

This form serves a complementary but distinct purpose from the ROI form. It addresses a common real-world need — allowing a spouse, adult child, or caregiver to call in and discuss a patient's care — without granting access to the full written medical record.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was linked directly from Essentia Health's medical records page (`essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`), according to the retrieval notes. The source URL is descriptive: `Verbal-Authorization.pdf`. It was found alongside the main ROI form (form-1) during a standard web search for Essentia Health release-of-information forms. No difficulty was reported in locating it.

The URL structure follows the same pattern as form-1 (`essentiahealth.org/-/media/Project/Essentia/Essentia/pages/documents/...`), indicating it is hosted on the main Essentia Health website alongside other patient documents. The placement is logical — a patient visiting the medical records page would see both the ROI form and this verbal authorization form as distinct options.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present and complete. The full text (5,186 characters across 2 pages) extracts cleanly with no OCR artifacts.

**Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite being a digitally-created document, all entry points use blank lines (`___`) or checkbox characters (`□`). A patient must print and handwrite all information. This is consistent with form-1 (also zero fillable fields), suggesting a system-wide design decision rather than a per-form oversight.

**File size:** 720 KB for 2 pages is notably large — over 4× the size of form-1 (169 KB for 1 page) and 6.5× form-2 (110 KB for 1 page). The metadata shows 21 fonts and 5 embedded images, which may explain the bloat. For a relatively simple form, this file size is disproportionate.

**Design origin:** Digitally composed (not a scan). The presence of 21 fonts (compared to 5 in form-1) suggests complex formatting or multiple design elements that could have been simplified.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** Two pages. Page 1 is the authorization form itself; page 2 is an FAQ/explanatory sheet. The two-page structure is well-conceived — the form stands alone on page 1, while page 2 provides context without cluttering the actionable document.

**Organization (Page 1):** The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow:
1. Patient demographic fields (name, DOB, MRN, address, phone)
2. Information categories to authorize (7 checkboxes plus "Other")
3. Designated persons (2 slots with name, relationship, address, phone)
4. Terms and conditions (8 bullet points)
5. Submission instructions
6. Signature block

**Information categories:** The form provides 7 category checkboxes:
- □ Scheduling/Appointment information
- □ Medical information, including symptoms, diagnosis, medications, treatment plan
- □ Behavioral health information, including symptoms, diagnosis, medications, treatment plan
- □ Substance Use Disorder information
- □ Lab/test results
- □ HIV related information (AIDS related testing)
- □ Billing and payment information including ClearBalance Account Authorization
- □ Other (describe)

This granularity allows patients to control exactly what types of information their designees can discuss, including appropriately separating sensitive categories (behavioral health, SUD, HIV).

**Organization (Page 2):** A well-structured FAQ page with five questions:
1. "How can I give others permission to get verbal information about me?"
2. "How is the information on the form used?"
3. "What are some examples of when this might be useful?"
4. "Can the person I designate also get copies of my medical records?"
5. "What if I change my mind?"
6. "What happens if I don't complete this form?"

The examples section is particularly effective, listing concrete scenarios: an elderly parent needing an adult child's help understanding treatment, a college student sharing information with a parent, an adult child checking on a parent's appointment time.

**Language clarity:** The form language is generally clear and uses plain English. The terms-and-conditions bullets on page 1 are more legalistic, but the FAQ on page 2 effectively translates the key concepts into accessible language.

**Designated person slots:** The form provides space for exactly 2 designated persons. Each slot includes fields for name, relationship, street address, city/state/zip, home phone, and work phone. This is practical for most situations but could be limiting for patients who want to designate more than two people.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Relevance to patient record access:** This form is **not** designed for a patient requesting their own records. It serves a different patient need — enabling verbal communication about the patient's care with trusted individuals. While not an ROI form, it is patient-centered in its own right: it addresses the practical reality that patients often need family members or caregivers to interact with providers on their behalf.

**Scope options:** The 7-category checkbox system gives patients meaningful control over what information can be discussed. The separate treatment of behavioral health, SUD, and HIV information respects the heightened sensitivity of these categories.

**Expiration:** The form states: "I understand the expiration date of this authorization is _____ or 1 year from today's date, whichever is sooner." This allows patients to set a shorter expiration but caps at one year. Page 2's FAQ adds: "This authorization must be renewed annually."

**Revocation:** Clearly stated: "I understand that I have the right to revoke my permission at any time except where Essentia Health has already made disclosures in reliance upon this request. I understand I must notify Essentia Health in writing if I want to revoke my permission."

**Anti-conditioning:** Present: "I understand that Essentia Health may not condition my treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility for benefits on my signing this authorization."

**Voluntariness:** Page 2 includes a reassuring closing statement: "We will continue to protect your private health information as required by law. Completion of this form is optional."

**Submission channels:** The form provides mail (Essentia Health - HIM, 502 East Second Street, Duluth MN 55805), fax (218-786-1370), and email (SendMyMedicalRecordstoHIM@essentiahealth.org). The inclusion of email is a positive convenience feature.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Regulatory references:** The terms cite:
- "Federal Privacy regulations 42 CFR Part 2; HIPAA" (for redisclosure)
- "HIPAA Privacy Rules 45 CFR 160, 164, 164.502; and 42 CFR 2.11, 2.31(b)" (for psychotherapy/SUD counseling notes exclusion)

**Psychotherapy notes:** The form states: "I understand psychotherapy and SUD counseling notes will not be released per facility; HIPAA Privacy Rules 45 CFR 160, 164, 164.502; and 42 CFR 2.11, 2.31(b)." This appropriately protects psychotherapy notes.

**HIV-related information:** The form includes a Wisconsin-specific provision: "I understand that:(1) my HIV test results may be released without my authorization to persons/organizations that have access under Wisconsin law; and that (2) a list of those persons/organizations is available upon request." This is relevant for Essentia Health's Wisconsin operations.

**Witness requirement:** The signature block requires a witness "only required if patient signature is made by mark" — this is a reasonable accommodation for patients who sign with an X or similar mark.

**Copy of form:** The form states: "I understand, that upon my request, I may receive a copy of this form after I have signed it."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"ClearBalance Account Authorization" bundled with billing category.** The billing checkbox reads: "Billing and payment information including ClearBalance Account Authorization." ClearBalance is a patient financing/payment plan product. Bundling authorization to discuss a financing account with general billing information is potentially confusing — a patient might check this box expecting to authorize discussion of simple billing questions, not realizing they're also authorizing disclosure related to a separate financial product.

- **Text extraction artifacts.** The extracted text shows some rendering issues: "I Work" appears where "Work" should be a field label (likely "Work phone"), and "IZ" and "ip" appear where "Zip" was split across lines. While these are extraction artifacts rather than form defects, they suggest the PDF layout may not render cleanly in all contexts.

- **Mismatch between form email and purpose.** The submission email address is "SendMyMedicalRecordstoHIM@essentiahealth.org" — an address that references "Medical Records," which is misleading for a verbal authorization form that explicitly does *not* authorize release of medical records. This could confuse patients into thinking they're requesting written records.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated FAQ page (page 2).** The second page provides clear, plain-language explanations with concrete examples of when verbal authorization is useful. The five practical scenarios (elderly parent, billing help, elderly patient with a friend, college student, adult child checking appointment times) effectively communicate the form's purpose. This is a model of patient-friendly supplementary documentation.

- **Granular information category controls.** The 7-checkbox system with separate handling of behavioral health, SUD, and HIV information gives patients meaningful control over what can be verbally discussed — not just a blanket "all information" authorization.

- **Explicit distinction from ROI form.** The FAQ clearly states that designated persons "can only receive verbal information" and directs patients to the separate Authorization for Use and Disclosure form for record copies. This prevents confusion between verbal sharing and written record release.

- **Recent revision.** The form ID "EH10302 12/25" indicates a December 2025 revision, consistent with the main ROI form (also dated 12/25), suggesting both forms were updated concurrently.

- **Consistent submission information.** The mailing address (502 East Second Street, Duluth MN 55805) and general format match form-1, providing consistency across the system's document portfolio.
