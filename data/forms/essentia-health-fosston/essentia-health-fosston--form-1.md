# Evaluation: Essentia Health-Fosston — form-1.pdf

## Organization
- **Name:** Essentia Health-Fosston (Fosston, MN)
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, part of regional Essentia Health system (nonprofit, Midwest)
- **Document:** "Authorization For Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (EH10843 12/25)

---

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-1 is a general-purpose **Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information** — the standard ROI form used system-wide across all Essentia Health facilities. It is not Fosston-specific; all submission instructions point to "Essentia Health - HIM, 502 East Second Street, Duluth MN 55805." The form number is EH10843, dated 12/25 (December 2025), indicating a recent revision.

This is one of four documents found for Essentia Health:
- **form-1.pdf** (this document): The primary ROI authorization form — the one a patient would use to request copies of their records.
- **form-2.pdf**: A MyChart Access Self-Authorization form (for portal enrollment, not record release).
- **form-3.pdf**: An Adult Patient Proxy Authorization form for MyChart (proxy portal access).
- **form-4.pdf**: A Verbal Authorization form (permission to *discuss* information verbally with designated people, not to release records).

Form-1 is clearly the primary document a patient would use when requesting their own health records. The other forms serve distinct, adjacent purposes.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Findability is **excellent**. Per the retrieval notes, a basic web search for "Essentia Health authorization release health information form PDF" immediately surfaced the direct PDF link. The form is also accessible from a well-organized medical records page at `essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`, which provides direct PDF download links alongside information about MyChart access and an online request tool (Swellbox/Datavant). The source URL is descriptive: `essentiahealth.org/-/media/.../Medical-Records-Authorization.pdf`.

Essentia Health also offers an **alternative online request pathway** via Swellbox (`swellbox.com/essentia-health-wizard.html`), giving patients a digital option beyond downloading and printing the PDF. This is noted in the retrieval notes, though not on the form itself.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present and complete — full text is extractable (4,757 characters).
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (0) interactive form fields. Despite being a digitally-created PDF (not a scan), the form uses blank lines (`_____`) for all data entry, requiring the patient to print and handwrite. This is a significant missed opportunity for a digital-first experience.
- **File size:** 169 KB for a single page — reasonable.
- **Page count:** 1 page — impressively compact for the amount of content covered.
- **Fonts:** 5 fonts embedded. **Images:** 5 embedded images (likely logos or design elements).
- **Design origin:** This is clearly a digitally-designed document (not a scan), which makes the lack of fillable fields a deliberate omission rather than a technical limitation.

The form is technically adequate as a printable document but fails to leverage its digital format. A patient receiving this PDF has no way to fill it electronically without third-party annotation tools.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and density:** The form packs substantial content into a single page. This is both a strength (concise, no unnecessary pages) and a challenge (the form is quite dense with small text and tight spacing).

**Organization:** The form follows a logical flow:
1. Patient Information (name, DOB, phone, email)
2. Release From (source provider/organization)
3. Release To (destination)
4. Reason for Release (checkboxes: Continuing care, Workers Compensation, School, Personal use, Insurance application, Insurance payment/claims, Legal, Other)
5. Information to Be Released (detailed record type checkboxes)
6. Behavioral Health and Substance Use Disorder sections
7. Date needed
8. Release Method
9. Legal notices and signature

**Record type granularity:** The form offers good specificity with an "All Routine Records" shortcut and 18+ individual record type checkboxes including: Discharge Summary, Diagnostic Test Results, Consultations, Radiology Reports, History and Physical Exams, Pathology Reports, Psychological Testing, Laboratory Reports, Operative/Procedure Reports, Progress/Provider Notes, HIV/AIDS Testing (WI Only), Forms Completion, Rehab Reports (PT/OT/SP), Emergency Reports, Billing Records, Medication List, Pathology Slides, Radiology Films/MRI, and Other.

**Language clarity:** The legal notice section uses reasonably clear language but is dense. Bullet points cover authorization expiration, revocation rights, redisclosure risks, psychotherapy note protections, non-conditioning of treatment, and fee disclosure. The form references specific regulations: "MN Statute 144.293, WI Statute 146.83, and NDCC 23-12-14" — appropriate for a multi-state system operating in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota.

**Delivery method options:** The form offers four delivery methods: MyChart, Fax, Email, Mail. If mailed, the patient can choose Paper or Disc format. The inclusion of MyChart and Email as options is notably progressive.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form is a **general-purpose authorization** — it uses "From" and "To" fields, designed primarily for transferring records between entities. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both the "From" field (with the facility that holds their records) and the "To" field (with their own name/address). The form does not distinguish between patient-directed access and third-party release, nor does it provide specific instructions for patients requesting their own records. The "Reason For Release" checkbox "Personal use" is the closest acknowledgment of a patient access scenario.

**Scope options:** Strong. Patients can specify date ranges ("Service Dates Between ___ to ___"), choose from granular record types, and separately control behavioral health and substance use disorder records with explicit initial-based opt-in/restriction.

**Delivery options:** The inclusion of MyChart, Email, Fax, and Mail (with Paper/Disc format choices) is good. Electronic delivery via MyChart or Email means patients don't need to wait for physical mail.

**Rights language:** The form includes a statement that "Essentia Health may not condition my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits on my signing this authorization" — important patient rights information. However, there is no explicit reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) or any plain-language explanation of patient rights to access their own records.

**EHI/bulk data:** No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or bulk data options.

**Fee disclosure:** The form states: "I may be required to pay a fee for retrieval and photocopying of records and/or supervising inspection of medical records" — referencing state statutes rather than HIPAA fee limits. The fee amount is not specified, and the phrasing is vague ("may be required").

---

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** Authorization lasts one year by default, with the option to set a different date. One year is standard and reasonable.

**Revocation:** The form clearly states patients may revoke authorization "at any time by notifying the providing organization in writing."

**Psychotherapy notes:** The form explicitly excludes psychotherapy notes: "I understand psychotherapy and SUD counseling notes will not be released per facility; HIPAA Privacy Rules 45 CFR 160, 164, 164.502; and 42 CFR 2.11, 2.31(b)." This appropriately separates psychotherapy notes from general records in accordance with HIPAA.

**SUD protections:** Substance Use Disorder records require a separate initial and specific date range, consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements. The form warns about potential redisclosure: "information used or disclosed pursuant to this authorization may be subject to redisclosure by the recipient and no longer be protected by Federal Privacy regulations 42 CFR Part 2; HIPAA."

**Authorized representative:** The form allows signature by a parent of a minor or "Court-Appointed Guardian/Legal Custodian/Conservator or Other Authorized Personal Representative" with the note that "legal documentation" must be included.

**Submission channels:** Records can be requested via email (ReleaseOfInformation@EssentiaHealth.org), mail, or fax (920-593-3114). No in-person-only restriction.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Behavioral health restriction language is confusing.** The form states: "All information regarding behavioral health will be released unless you restrict by initialing here: ___." This opt-out-by-initial approach is the inverse of the SUD section (which requires initialing to opt *in*). The inconsistent consent model (opt-out for behavioral health, opt-in for SUD) may confuse patients about what they are authorizing.

- **Fee language is vague.** The statement "I may be required to pay a fee for retrieval and photocopying of records" gives patients no indication of how much records might cost. The references to state statutes (MN 144.293, WI 146.83, NDCC 23-12-14) rather than HIPAA cost-based fee limits leave the fee framework unclear.

- **"HIV/AIDS Testing (WI Only)" checkbox** appears in the general record types list but the form's geographic scope spans MN, WI, and ND. It's unclear what happens if a patient in Minnesota checks this box, or whether HIV-related records for non-WI patients are handled differently.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Email address formatting defect.** The contact email appears in extracted text as "ReleaseOflnformation@EssentiaHealth.org" — with a lowercase "L" potentially rendered as or confused with a capital "I" or "l" in the PDF. The correct address likely uses "Information" but the PDF rendering may cause copy-paste errors for patients.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Single-page form.** Fitting a comprehensive ROI authorization onto one page is an accomplishment. Many comparable forms span 2-4 pages.

- **Electronic delivery options.** Offering MyChart, Email, Fax, and Mail (Paper/Disc) gives patients meaningful delivery choices — particularly the email option, which many health systems omit.

- **Online alternative exists.** While not mentioned on the form itself, Essentia Health offers a Swellbox-based online request wizard as an alternative to downloading/printing/submitting this PDF.

- **Recent revision.** The form is dated 12/25 (December 2025), indicating active maintenance and recent updates.

- **Multi-state legal compliance.** The form references statutes from three states (MN, WI, ND), reflecting Essentia Health's multi-state footprint and attempt to provide a single unified form.
