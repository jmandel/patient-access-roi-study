# Essentia Health-Fosston: ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Essentia Health-Fosston
- **Website:** https://www.essentiahealth.org/find-facility/essentia-health-fosston
- **Location:** Fosston, MN
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, part of regional Essentia Health system (nonprofit, Midwest)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Essentia Health authorization release health information form PDF"** — immediately surfaced the direct PDF link and the medical records page. Very effective.
2. **Web search for "Essentia Health Fosston medical records release form PDF"** — pointed to the same Essentia Health medical records page. The Fosston facility does not have its own form; it uses the system-wide Essentia Health forms.
3. **Navigated the Essentia Health medical records page** (https://www.essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records) — found the main authorization form, a verbal authorization form, and references to MyChart-based access and an online request tool (Swellbox/Datavant).

- **Pages:** 1 (appears to be a 2-page form based on content)

## Difficulties
- **None significant.** The forms were easy to find. Essentia Health has a well-organized medical records page with direct PDF links.
- form-3.pdf (MyChart Adult Proxy) has no extractable text — it was created via "Print to PDF" which rendered it as a non-text document despite being a vector PDF.
- Essentia Health-Fosston does not have facility-specific forms; all forms are system-wide via the parent Essentia Health organization.

## Additional Notes
- Essentia Health also offers an **online request tool** via Swellbox (https://www.swellbox.com/essentia-health-wizard.html) as an alternative to downloading and submitting the PDF form.
- Their ROI vendor is **Datavant** (contact: 866-203-7454).
- The medical records page mentions **MyChart** as the primary way to access records, with the PDF authorization form as a secondary option.
