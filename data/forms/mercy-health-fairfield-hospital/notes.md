# Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital
- **Location**: Fairfield, OH
- **Website**: https://www.mercy.com/locations/hospitals/cincinnati/mercy-health-fairfield-hospital
- **Parent System**: Bon Secours Mercy Health (major nonprofit system)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Mercy Health Ohio medical records release form PDF authorization" — immediately returned the Mercy Health medical records request page and a direct link to the Cincinnati-region authorization form PDF.
2. **Visited the Mercy Health medical records request page** at https://www.mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests — found two versions of the authorization form (English and Spanish), plus information about MyChart and online eRequest options via Ciox/Datavant.

The parent system (Mercy Health / mercy.com) manages medical records centrally. Fairfield Hospital is explicitly listed as a checkbox option on the Cincinnati-region form, and the medical records page lists a dedicated fax number for Fairfield (513-599-4491).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/cincinnati.ashx
- **File size**: 312,932 bytes (313 KB)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION" — Cincinnati-region specific form. Has full text layer with extractable text. Lists Mercy Health Cincinnati hospitals as checkboxes (Anderson, Clermont, Fairfield, Jewish, West). Includes sections for patient info, dates of service, specific records to disclose, recipient, delivery format (paper or electronic PDF/CD), and purpose of disclosure. References HIPAA § 164.524. Revision date: MHP 0786 Rev 1/19.
- **Initial impression**: This is the primary ROI/authorization form applicable to Fairfield Hospital. It is a proper authorization form with a text layer, though it does not appear to have fillable form fields.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/mh-authorization-22024.ashx
- **File size**: 151,891 bytes (152 KB)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Updated/newer system-wide authorization form (filename suggests 2024 revision). Almost entirely image-based with minimal extractable text ("1ROI" and "Printed: 2024-01-17 08:19 MHP0786.dcl"). Contains a large scanned image (2550x3300 pixels at 300 DPI). This appears to be a scanned version of a similar or updated authorization form.
- **Initial impression**: This is the current version of the ROI form linked from the medical records page under "Medical Records Request Forms (English)". It is an image-only scan with no usable text layer.

## Difficulties
- **No major difficulties** — the form was easy to find via both web search and navigating the Mercy Health website.
- The current "official" form (form-2.pdf) linked from the medical records page is an image-only scan, which is a significant accessibility limitation compared to the older Cincinnati-specific form (form-1.pdf) which has a full text layer.
- The older Cincinnati-specific form URL (cincinnati.ashx) still works but is not directly linked from the current medical records page; the page now links to the newer system-wide form.

## Additional Notes
- Mercy Health also offers medical records requests via **MyChart** (patient portal) and an **online eRequest** system through Ciox/Datavant (https://www.swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html).
- Spanish version of the form is also available at: https://www.mercy.com/-/media/mercy/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/mh-authorization-spanish-22024.ashx
- Authorization expires after 1 year for Ohio & Kentucky, 60 days for Michigan.
