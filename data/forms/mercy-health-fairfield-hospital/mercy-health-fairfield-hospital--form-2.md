## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-2.pdf is a system-wide authorization for release of protected health information, filed under the URL slug `mh-authorization-22024.ashx` (suggesting a 2024 revision). It is a 1-page, 152 KB PDF consisting almost entirely of a scanned image (2550×3300 pixels at 300 DPI). The only extractable text is a metadata stub: `"1ROI"` and `"Printed: 2024-01-17 08:19 MHP0786.dcl"`.

This form appears to be the **current, primary version** linked from the Mercy Health medical records request page under "Medical Records Request Forms (English)." It replaces an older Cincinnati-region form (form-1.pdf, `cincinnati.ashx`) that had a full text layer and structured content. Based on the form number `MHP0786` shared between both documents and the notes describing form-1 as "Rev 1/19," form-2 appears to be an updated edition of the same authorization — but delivered as a flat scan rather than a natively digital PDF.

A Spanish version is also available at a similar URL. Mercy Health additionally offers MyChart and a Ciox/Datavant eRequest portal for records requests.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Findability is **good**. Per the retrieval notes, the form was located quickly via both web search and by navigating the Mercy Health website. The medical records request page at `mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests` links directly to the form. The URL path (`/patient-resources/medical-records-requests/`) is reasonably descriptive, though the filename `mh-authorization-22024.ashx` is an opaque CMS-generated slug rather than a human-readable name like `authorization-form.pdf`.

The page is managed at the parent system level (mercy.com), which centralizes records request information for all Mercy Health facilities including Fairfield Hospital. This is a reasonable approach for a large system, though it means a patient searching specifically for "Fairfield Hospital medical records form" must recognize that the system-wide form applies to them.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

Technical accessibility is **very poor**. This document is functionally an image-only scan despite technically containing a minimal text layer. Key observations:

- **Text layer**: Contains only 46 characters — `"1ROI"` and `"Printed: 2024-01-17 08:19 MHP0786.dcl"`. This is print metadata, not form content. No form fields, instructions, or legal text are extractable as text.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive fields whatsoever.
- **Embedded images**: 2 images, with the primary one being a full-page 2550×3300 pixel raster scan at 300 DPI. This is literally a photograph or scan of a paper form.
- **Font count**: 2 fonts (used only for the tiny metadata text).
- **File size**: 152 KB for a 1-page image-only scan is relatively compact, but size is the least of the concerns here.
- **Digital-first design**: This is emphatically **not** a digital-first document. It is a scanned paper form that has been uploaded as a PDF. A patient who downloads this must print it, fill it by hand, and submit it physically (mail, fax, or in person).

The form is not screen-reader accessible, cannot be filled on a computer or mobile device, and its content cannot be searched, copied, or translated by assistive technology.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

Because form-2.pdf is an image-only scan with no extractable text, the content cannot be evaluated through the metadata alone. However, the retrieval notes and comparison with form-1.pdf provide important context:

- **Length**: 1 page, which is appropriate for an authorization form.
- **Content (inferred)**: The form number `MHP0786` matches form-1.pdf, and the filename suffix `22024` suggests a 2024 update to the same document. Form-1.pdf (the older version with extractable text) contained well-organized sections for patient identification, facility selection, date ranges, specific record types, recipient designation, delivery format options, and legal disclosures. If form-2 follows a similar structure, the content design is likely adequate — but this cannot be confirmed from the scan.
- **Readability**: At 300 DPI the scan should be legible when printed, but on-screen readability may suffer, particularly on mobile devices. Pinch-to-zoom is required, and there is no reflow capability.
- **Layout**: Cannot be assessed in detail from metadata. The scan dimensions (2550×3300 pixels) correspond to a standard US Letter page.

The fundamental content design problem is not the layout of the form itself but the decision to publish it as a scan rather than a natively digital PDF.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

Patient-centeredness is **significantly undermined** by the image-only format:

- **Patient access vs. third-party release**: Based on comparison with form-1.pdf (same form number MHP0786), the form includes a "Self" checkbox under the disclosure recipient section, indicating it serves both patient access and third-party release use cases. However, since form-2 is image-only, this cannot be confirmed directly.
- **Scope options**: Form-1 (the text-extractable predecessor) offered granular record type selection (discharge summary, H&P, operative records, lab/radiology, therapy notes, itemized bills, etc.) and date range specification. Form-2 likely offers similar options but requires handwriting them.
- **Format options**: Form-1 offered "Paper or Electronic (PDF/CD)" and delivery via mail, fax, MyChart, or secure email. If form-2 preserves these options, that's a positive feature — but the irony of offering electronic delivery on a form that itself cannot be filled electronically is notable.
- **HIPAA Right of Access**: Form-1 explicitly referenced "United States Code of Federal Regulations at section 164.524." This reference likely appears in form-2 as well but is trapped in the image.
- **EHI Export**: No indication of EHI export or bulk data options in either form.
- **Alternative submission**: Mercy Health does offer MyChart and a Ciox/Datavant eRequest portal (swellbox.com), which are important alternative pathways. However, this particular PDF form requires manual completion.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

Based on what can be inferred from form-1 (same form number) and the retrieval notes:

- **Fees**: Form-1 stated "There may be a charge for copies of records" — a vague but not atypical disclosure. No specific fee schedule is provided.
- **Expiration**: "This authorization will expire one year from date for Ohio & Kentucky and 60 days from date for Michigan." The 1-year expiration for Ohio is standard. The 60-day Michigan expiration is notably short but reflects Michigan state law requirements.
- **Revocation rights**: Form-1 included clear language about the right to revoke in writing.
- **Voluntary authorization**: Form-1 explicitly stated that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment.
- **Photo ID requirement**: Form-1 stated "Photo ID required at the time of request," which is a common but notable requirement that could create barriers for some patients.
- **No notarization required**.
- **No in-person-only submission** — mail, fax, MyChart, and secure email are listed as delivery/submission methods.

No egregious compliance violations are apparent, though the image-only format itself could be considered an accessibility barrier.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Image-only scan replacing a functional digital form**: The most significant concern is that Mercy Health has replaced an older, text-extractable, well-structured PDF (form-1, Rev 1/19) with a flat scan (form-2, printed 2024-01-17). This is a regression in accessibility. The older form had 9 fonts, 5,192 characters of extractable text, and a properly structured digital layout. The replacement has 2 fonts, 46 characters of metadata text, and a single raster image. This suggests someone printed the form, scanned it, and uploaded the scan as the "official" version — destroying all digital accessibility in the process.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Form content unverifiable**: Because the form is an image scan with no extractable text, it is impossible to verify what the current form actually says. It may differ from the older text-extractable version (form-1) in significant ways — updated legal language, changed fee disclosures, modified expiration terms — but none of this can be confirmed without OCR or visual inspection.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **`is_image_only_scan` metadata mismatch**: The metadata reports `is_image_only_scan: false` because the PDF technically contains a vestigial text layer with 46 characters of print metadata (`"1ROI"` and `"Printed: 2024-01-17 08:19 MHP0786.dcl"`). For all practical purposes, this IS an image-only scan — the text layer contains zero form content.
- **Opaque filename**: The URL `mh-authorization-22024.ashx` provides no clear indication this is a medical records authorization form. The `22024` suffix could be misread as a date or version number with no clear meaning.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Alternative digital pathways exist**: Despite this PDF being a poor digital artifact, Mercy Health offers MyChart and a Ciox/Datavant eRequest portal (swellbox.com) for online records requests — providing patients with genuinely electronic alternatives.
- **Spanish-language version available**: A Spanish version of the form is also published, demonstrating attention to language accessibility.
- **Centralized, easy-to-find records page**: The parent system's medical records request page is well-organized and easy to locate, with dedicated contact information (including fax numbers) for each facility.
