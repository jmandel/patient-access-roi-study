# Evaluation: Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is **not from Hillcrest Hospital Claremore**. It is an "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION" form belonging to **Hillcrest Internal Medicine**, a completely unrelated medical practice located at "Fourth Ave, Suite 505, San Diego, CA 92103" with phone number "(619) 298-1318." The form was retrieved as a false positive during web searches for ROI forms mentioning "Hillcrest" and was retained per study protocol.

The organization under study — Hillcrest Hospital Claremore in Claremore, OK — is part of the Hillcrest HealthCare System (Ardent Health Services). The correct system-wide ROI form is form-2.pdf, which explicitly lists "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" as a checkbox option among nine facilities. Form-1 has no connection to the Oklahoma health system whatsoever.

This is a single-page, 302 KB PDF from `hillcrestinternal.com`. It bears no branding, form number, or other identifiers linking it to the study organization.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form is irrelevant to patients of Hillcrest Hospital Claremore, so findability is evaluated only in terms of how it surfaced during research. It appeared as a search result for queries containing "Hillcrest" combined with ROI-related terms. Its presence in results demonstrates a name-collision problem: unrelated organizations with similar names can pollute search results, potentially confusing patients. A patient searching for "Hillcrest medical records release form" could plausibly land on this San Diego practice's form instead of the Oklahoma hospital's form, especially without geographic qualifiers.

The actual Hillcrest Hospital Claremore form (form-2) was found via the parent system website at `hillcrest.com`, reachable in 2–3 clicks from the Medical Records Request page. This false-positive form does not affect the findability assessment of the correct form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

Despite being irrelevant to the study organization, the document's technical properties are noted for completeness:

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (2,110 characters).
- **Fillable fields:** 35 interactive form fields are reported in the metadata, though `fillable_field_names` is empty (field names were not extracted). This is a relatively high field count for a single-page form, suggesting reasonable digital interactivity.
- **File size:** 302 KB for a single page is moderately large, likely due to the one embedded image (possibly a logo or letterhead graphic).
- **Fonts:** 5 fonts used.
- **Format:** Digitally created (not a scan); `is_image_only_scan: false`.

The form appears to be a functional fillable PDF, which is technically competent — but none of this is relevant to patients of Hillcrest Hospital Claremore.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The form is a single page covering:
- **Patient identification:** Patient Name, DOB, SSN
- **Direction of release:** Dual-direction authorization — both "obtain information from" and "release information to" with fields for provider/facility name, address, phone, fax
- **Purpose checkboxes:** Continuing Care, Insurance, Personal
- **Record type checkboxes:** Pertinent information, Specific information, Progress notes, Radiology, Lab Results, Billing, Treatment summary, Entire record, plus an "Other" free-text field
- **Sensitive information section:** Separate initials required for Mental Health treatment information, HIV test results, and Substance abuse diagnosis/treatment
- **Authorization duration:** Three options — single request, one year from date, or ongoing for future treatment of described type
- **Patient rights disclosures:** Five bullet points covering right to treatment unaffected, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, potential charges, and right to copy

The language is reasonably clear. The patient rights section uses accessible phrasing like "My right to healthcare treatment is not conditioned on this authorization" and "I may cancel this authorization at any time." The record type options include a useful "Treatment summary (includes H&P, labs, radiology, op reports, pathology, etc.)" bundle that could help patients who don't know specific record types.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

The form's dual-direction structure ("obtain from" / "release to") is oriented toward provider-to-provider transfers rather than patient self-access. There is no specific pathway or language for a patient requesting their own records. The "Personal" purpose checkbox is the closest option but doesn't differentiate between a patient accessing their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access and a third-party release scenario.

The form requests a **Social Security Number**, which is not required for records requests and raises privacy concerns. No electronic delivery options are mentioned — the form references fax submission ("PLEASE FAX TO 619-298-0843") as the primary mechanism. There is no mention of HIPAA § 164.524, patient rights under the Right of Access, or electronic health information export.

Again, this entire assessment is moot for Hillcrest Hospital Claremore patients, who would use form-2 instead.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

The form includes standard HIPAA authorization elements: revocation rights, purpose specification, expiration options, and a note about potential charges. It appropriately separates sensitive information categories (mental health, HIV, substance abuse) requiring separate initials, consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 and state confidentiality requirements.

The SSN field is notable — while not necessarily a HIPAA violation, requesting SSN on a records release form goes beyond what is needed for patient identification and creates unnecessary risk if the form is transmitted via fax.

The expiration options are flexible (single use, one year, or ongoing), which is reasonable. The form does not impose notarization or in-person submission requirements.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Wrong organization entirely:** This form belongs to Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego, CA — it has no connection to Hillcrest Hospital Claremore in Oklahoma. A patient who found and submitted this form would be sending their authorization to a completely unrelated practice across the country. The name collision between "Hillcrest Internal Medicine" (San Diego) and "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" (Oklahoma) is a real-world findability hazard.
- **SSN collection:** The form includes a field for "SSN:" — Social Security Numbers are unnecessary for medical records requests and create identity theft risk, especially given the fax-based submission model.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Dual-direction authorization without clear patient-access path:** The form simultaneously authorizes Hillcrest Internal Medicine to "obtain information from" and "release information to," which may confuse patients who simply want copies of their own records. It is unclear how a patient requesting their own records should fill out the "obtain from" / "release to" fields.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **False match for study organization:** This document was retrieved as a search result for Hillcrest Hospital Claremore but belongs to an entirely different organization in a different state. While retained per study protocol, it cannot be used for any evaluation of the study organization's ROI practices.
