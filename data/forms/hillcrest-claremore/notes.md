# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Hillcrest Hospital Claremore
- **Location:** Claremore, OK
- **Website:** https://hillcrest.com/locations/hillcrest-hospital-claremore
- **Parent System:** Hillcrest HealthCare System (part of Ardent Health Services)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs:** Searched `"Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct results for Claremore-specific form.
2. **Web search for release forms:** Searched `"Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — no direct results.
3. **Site-scoped search:** Searched `site:hillcrest.com authorization release medical records` — found the system-wide Medical Records Request page at https://hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/. This was the most productive strategy.
4. **Parent system website navigation:** The Medical Records Request page on hillcrest.com serves all Hillcrest HealthCare System facilities, including Hillcrest Hospital Claremore (explicitly listed in the sidebar and on the form itself).

## What Worked
The site-scoped web search led to the Hillcrest HealthCare System's centralized Medical Records Request page, which provides:
- MyChart portal access for electronic records requests
- An online request platform via Swellbox (https://www.swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html)
- A downloadable paper ROI form (PDF)

The paper ROI form is a system-wide form with checkboxes for each facility, including Hillcrest Hospital Claremore.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://hillcrestinternal.com/forms/Record%20Authorization%20Form_Final.pdf
- **What it is:** Authorization for Release of Medical Information form for **Hillcrest Internal Medicine** in San Diego, CA (619 area code). This is a completely unrelated organization — not part of Hillcrest HealthCare System in Oklahoma.
- **File size:** 302,223 bytes
- **Note:** Downloaded as a search result from web queries mentioning "Hillcrest." Kept per study protocol but not relevant to Hillcrest Hospital Claremore.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://hillcrest.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/12/ROI.Current.English.HMC1072.pdf
- **What it is:** The official **Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information** form for the Hillcrest HealthCare System. This is the correct ROI form. It lists all system facilities with checkboxes, including Hillcrest Hospital Claremore. 2 pages, has text layer, appears to be a digitally-created form (not a scan).
- **File size:** 136,435 bytes
- **Key features:** Facility selection checkboxes, record type options (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, Progress Notes, X-ray reports, ER Record, Consultation, Lab reports), purpose options, 6-month auto-expiration, patient signature line.

## Difficulties
- No Claremore-specific ROI form exists; the system uses a single form across all facilities.
- One search result (hillcrestfamilymedicine.com) had an SSL error preventing download; this turned out to be an unrelated organization anyway.
- The correct form was straightforward to find once navigating the parent system's website.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The form is linked from the system-wide Medical Records Request page under "Policies and Disclosures," accessible in 2-3 clicks from the main website.
