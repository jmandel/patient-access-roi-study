# Duke University Hospital — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-2.pdf is **not** an ROI authorization form itself. It is a **companion instruction document** titled "Instructions for Completing the Authorization for Release of Information Form." It walks the reader through Parts A through G of the actual M3132 authorization form (found as form-1.pdf, Rev. 4/2024, and form-4.pdf, Rev. 3/2025). The document is 3 pages, 508 KB, with a revision date of "Rev. 1/22" (January 2022).

In the context of Duke's ROI document set, this is one of four retrieved documents:
- **form-1.pdf**: The actual M3132 authorization form (Rev. 4/2024, 45 fillable fields)
- **form-2.pdf** *(this document)*: Instructions for completing the M3132 form
- **form-3.pdf**: An image-only scanned release form from a Duke outpatient clinic
- **form-4.pdf**: The current M3132 authorization form (Rev. 3/2025, 67 fillable fields)

Because this is a supplementary instruction sheet rather than a standalone authorization form, several evaluation dimensions (e.g., fillable fields, compliance language) are assessed in terms of how well it supports patient use of the companion form.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this document was found on Duke Health's official "Authorization Forms and Instructions for Medical Records" page at `dukehealth.org/medical-records/authorization-forms-and-instructions-medical-records`. The page title explicitly mentions "instructions," and the document was linked alongside the authorization form itself. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy** — forms are described as being 2 clicks from the homepage (Medical Records → Authorization Forms).

The source URL (`2019-04-01_duke_health_authorization_instructions.pdf`) includes a date stamp from April 2019, while the document itself shows "Rev. 1/22." This URL-vs-content date mismatch is minor but could confuse someone trying to verify they have the current version.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (7,745 characters across 3 pages).
- **Fillable fields**: 0. This is appropriate since the document is instructional, not a fillable form.
- **File size**: 508 KB for 3 pages of mostly text content. The 16 embedded images suggest decorative elements or logos, making the file somewhat larger than necessary for a text-based instruction sheet.
- **Font count**: 6 fonts — reasonable for a formatted instructional document.
- **Digital-first design**: The document has a proper text layer and clean extraction, indicating it was created digitally (not scanned). However, it is a flat PDF with no interactive elements — no hyperlinks within the text, no clickable cross-references to the companion form.
- **Format**: Standard PDF. No version information extracted, but the clean text layer and font embedding indicate a modern PDF.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 3 pages for an instruction document covering 7 form sections (Parts A–G) is proportionate and manageable.

**Clarity**: The language is notably plain and patient-friendly. Instructions are written as direct, numbered steps: "Write the patient's full name, phone number, email address, and mailing address." Each form part gets a clear heading and step-by-step explanation. Medical terms are defined inline — for example, "Discharge Summary - A brief summary at the conclusion of a hospital stay" and "Consultation Report – Report from a hospital stay with consulting physician when the attending provider asks another provider to examine the patient's specific medical problem."

**Organization**: The document follows the authorization form's structure (Parts A through G) sequentially. Each section is labeled with the same part letters used on the form itself, making it easy to cross-reference. The progression is logical: patient info → recipient → records to release → purpose → delivery format → sensitive info review → signature → witness → submission instructions.

**Layout**: The document uses bullet points and numbered items for readability. The Part C section on record types includes detailed definitions of each record category (Discharge Summary, History & Physical, Clinic Visits, etc.), which runs long but is genuinely informative. There is some visual density in the middle pages where record type definitions are listed.

**Helpfulness of guidance**: The instructions provide genuinely useful context. For example, under Part B: "You must be specific. General terms like 'my son' or 'my daughter' will not be accepted." Under Part E, the MyChart delivery option includes practical caveats: "Minor Children under age 12 – will be released to Parent" and "Children Ages 12-17 – Unable to release records to these accounts."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access orientation**: The instructions explicitly address patients requesting their own records. Item 3 states: "If you are the patient and are requesting the records be sent to you, select 'Self.'" The document serves both patient-access and third-party release scenarios but does not separate or privilege either pathway.

**Scope options explained**: The instructions clearly explain how to select treatment dates, record types, and treatment locations. The default behavior is documented: "If none selected, the last 2 years of active treatment will be provided." The distinction between Abstract/Summary and Entire Record is well-explained, including the important note that "Billing Records" and "Radiology Images" must be specifically selected even when requesting the entire record.

**Format/delivery options explained**: Part E instructions describe multiple electronic delivery options in detail — MyChart, encrypted email, fax, and a vendor portal for third parties. Physical options include thumb drive/CD and paper, available by mail or in-person pickup. The caveat about file size limitations is noted: "*Depending on size of file, we may contact you to select a different format of delivery."

**Contact information**: The document provides a phone number at the top ("please call the HIM Department at 919-684-1700") and full submission details at the bottom (mail address, email: ROI-requestor3@dm.duke.edu, fax: 919-620-5165).

**Representative access**: Part F provides detailed guidance on authorized representatives, listing specific legal document types (Health Care Power of Attorney, Legal Guardianship, Executor/Executrix of Estate, Next of Kin) with explanations of each. The supporting documentation requirements (death certificate, marriage license, birth certificate, obituary) are clearly listed.

**No mention of HIPAA Right of Access** (45 CFR § 164.524) or patient rights language. No mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration**: The instructions note the authorization "will automatically expire one year from the signature date in Part F" unless a different date or event is specified. One year is a standard and reasonable expiration period.

**Fees**: Not addressed in the instruction document. The companion forms (form-1 and form-4) mention that "Duke Health may charge a fee" but do not disclose specific amounts. The updated form-4 notes "Charges may apply" for CD and paper delivery.

**Submission methods**: Multiple submission channels are provided — mail, email, and fax. No requirement for in-person submission or notarization.

**Sensitive information**: The instructions explain that some records are "marked as sensitive by Duke Health" and require explicit approval for release, covering mental/behavioral health and genetic testing categories.

**Witness requirement**: Part G notes the witness is "Optional" — a Duke Employee may sign as witness "for patient verification" but it is not required.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Plain-language record type definitions**: The instructions define each medical record type in accessible language (e.g., "Laboratory - A procedure in which a health care provider takes a sample of the patient's blood, urine, other bodily fluid, or body tissue to obtain information about the patient's health"). This level of patient education in a form instruction document is uncommon and genuinely helpful.
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: MyChart, encrypted email, fax, and portal — with practical details about age restrictions and file size limitations. The breadth and transparency of delivery options is above average.
- **Companion instruction document exists at all**: Many healthcare organizations provide only the raw authorization form. Duke's decision to create a separate, detailed instruction document with a helpline phone number ("please call the HIM Department at 919-684-1700") demonstrates investment in patient guidance.
- **Explicit "Self" option**: Directly addressing patients requesting their own records in item 3 is a simple but effective patient-access feature.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Revision date mismatch**: The document is dated "Rev. 1/22" but the companion authorization forms have been revised to Rev. 4/2024 and Rev. 3/2025. The instructions may not reflect changes made to the newer form revisions (e.g., form-4 adds "Duke Lake Norman Hospital" as a treatment location and adds cardiology/neurology imaging options not mentioned in these instructions).
- **Children ages 12-17 MyChart restriction**: The instructions state "Children Ages 12-17 – Unable to release records to these accounts. Alternative means of delivery will be requested." This is stated without explanation of why, which could frustrate parents of adolescents. It likely relates to state minor consent laws but no context is given.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **URL filename date mismatch**: The source URL contains `2019-04-01` while the document revision date is "Rev. 1/22," suggesting the file was updated in place without renaming. This is a web management issue, not a document error per se, but undermines confidence in version currency.
- **Missing typo/formatting**: Near the end of Part F, the text reads "to establishthat" (missing space between "establish" and "that"), indicating a minor formatting defect.
