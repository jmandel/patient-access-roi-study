# Duke University Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for filetype:pdf** — `Duke University Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — found direct PDF URLs from dukehealth.org
2. **Web search for medical records page** — `Duke Health "medical records" "release form" request records authorization` — found the main forms landing page at dukehealth.org/medical-records/authorization-forms-and-instructions-medical-records
3. **Site-scoped search** — `site:dukehealth.org authorization release medical records form` — confirmed URLs and found additional resources
4. **Navigated the official forms page** — https://www.dukehealth.org/medical-records/authorization-forms-and-instructions-medical-records — listed all available forms with download links

## Difficulties

- No significant difficulties. Duke Health has a well-organized medical records section with clearly labeled form downloads.
- The web search initially surfaced an older revision of the main form (Rev. 4/2024); the official page now links to a newer version (Rev. 3/2025).
- One form found via a Duke outpatient clinic site (sites.duke.edu) was an image-only scan with no text layer.
