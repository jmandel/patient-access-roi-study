# El Rio Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: El Rio Health (El Rio Community Health Center)
- **Location**: Tucson, AZ
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit
- **Website**: https://elrio.org

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI/authorization form**: Multiple queries including `"El Rio Health" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf`, `"El Rio Health" "medical records" "release form" PDF`, and variations. No direct PDF link to an ROI form was found.

2. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:elrio.org authorization release medical records` — no relevant results.

3. **Website navigation**: Navigated the full El Rio Health website including:
   - Homepage (elrio.org)
   - For Patients section (elrio.org/for-patients/)
   - Patient Information page (elrio.org/for-patients/patient-information/) — only has Welcome Booklet, Compliance Booklet, Sliding Fee Scale, and Surprise Billing notice
   - Contact Us page (elrio.org/contact-us/)
   - Extracted all navigation links from the header — no "Medical Records," "Forms," or "Release of Information" page exists

4. **Sitemap analysis**: Checked `page-sitemap.xml` — no medical records or forms page listed.

5. **WordPress upload directory probing**: Tried ~12 common filename patterns for authorization forms in `/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/` and `/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/` — none found (all returned 404).

6. **MyChart portal**: Checked the El Rio MyChart FAQ page — standard Epic MyChart FAQ with no mention of downloadable ROI forms.

7. **Wayback Machine**: Checked for historical versions of medical records or authorization pages — no archived versions found.

8. **Compliance booklet review**: Downloaded and reviewed the 16-page compliance booklet (their HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices). It describes patient rights to access records but does not contain an actual authorization form.

## What Was Found

El Rio Health does **not** publish a downloadable ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form on their public website. Their approach to medical records access is:
- **MyChart portal** for online record viewing/downloading
- **Phone contact** at (520) 670-3909 to request forms
- **In-person** at clinic locations

The only patient-facing documents available for download are:
- New Patient Welcome Booklet
- New Patient Compliance Booklet (HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices)
- Sliding Fee Scale information
- Surprise Medical Bills notice

## Downloaded Files

| Filename | Source URL | Document Type |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| form-1.pdf | https://elrio.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/compliance-booklet-eng.pdf | HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices / Compliance Booklet (16 pages). Describes patient rights including right to access records, but is NOT an ROI authorization form. |

## Difficulties Encountered

- **No ROI form published online**: Despite extensive searching across the website, web search engines, and the Wayback Machine, El Rio Health does not make an ROI/authorization form available for download.
- **Minimal patient forms section**: The Patient Information page has very few downloadable documents (only booklets and notices, no actionable forms).
- **No medical records page**: Unlike many health systems, El Rio Health has no dedicated "Medical Records" or "Health Information Management" page on their website.
- **Portal-centric approach**: El Rio directs patients to MyChart for records access, but the portal requires authentication and doesn't provide a public-facing ROI form.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard/Impossible

No ROI form is publicly available for download from El Rio Health's website. The compliance booklet was downloaded as the closest relevant document for study purposes.
