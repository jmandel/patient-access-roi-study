# GI Alliance — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** GI Alliance
- **Website:** https://gialliance.com
- **Location:** Southlake, TX
- **Type:** Physician practice, for-profit, major system affiliation, South census region

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release forms with filetype:pdf** — The first search did not return direct PDF links but confirmed the organization uses such forms. The second search returned links to affiliate practice forms (University GI, GI Associates).
2. **Site-specific search on gialliance.com** — Successfully found the main GI Alliance authorization form hosted directly at `gialliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/authorization-health-form.pdf`.
3. **Additional web search for patient forms pages** — Confirmed the main form URL and also found a HealthMark Group digital portal reference and affiliate-specific forms.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://gialliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/authorization-health-form.pdf
- **File size:** 96,670 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Initial impression:** This is the primary GI Alliance "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" form. It is a text-based PDF created in Microsoft Word (not a scan). It includes fields for patient name, birth date, recipient info, record type selection (all records or specific types), sensitive information categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance use, genetic info), purpose, authorization duration (1 year), revocation instructions, and signature. It is a general-purpose ROI form — not specifically a patient-access form, but usable for patient requests (has a "at Patient's request" purpose checkbox). No fillable form fields (flat PDF).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.granitepeaksgi.com/wp-content/uploads/Release-of-Records-GI-Alliance.pdf
- **File size:** 256,151 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Initial impression:** This is a GI Alliance-branded "Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party" form from Granite Peaks GI (a GI Alliance affiliate). It is an image-only scan (no extractable text layer). The pdftotext output is garbled OCR artifacts. Created with PDFCreator/Ghostscript in January 2025. Being a 2-page scanned form, it likely contains more detailed release instructions but is not digitally accessible.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.universitygi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Medical-Release-Form.pdf
- **File size:** 301,396 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Initial impression:** This is a scanned medical release form from University GI (a GI Alliance affiliate). Title metadata says "Scanned Image" and it was created with NAPS2 scanning software. Image-only PDF with no text layer. It contains a single full-page scan of a medical release form.

## Difficulties
- The main gialliance.com form (form-1) was relatively easy to find — directly linked from the website's uploads directory and surfaced by web search.
- Affiliate practices (Granite Peaks GI, University GI) have their own versions of the form, but these are image-only scans rather than text-based PDFs.
- No forms appeared to be behind a login wall or patient portal.
- The GI Alliance patient forms page (gialliance.com/patient-forms-and-prep/) exists but is organized by local brand/location, making it somewhat complex to navigate.

## Summary
Found 3 forms total: 1 text-based authorization form from the main GI Alliance website, and 2 image-only scanned forms from affiliate practices. The primary form (form-1.pdf) is the canonical GI Alliance ROI/authorization form. Retrieval difficulty: **easy** for the main form.
