# Evaluation: San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an **older version** of the organization's "Authorization to Release Medical Record Information" form. It carries form number **000700 (08-13)**, indicating an August 2013 revision date. The organization has three forms on file:

- **form-1.pdf** — The current 2024-updated version of the same authorization form (form number 000700, dated 09-22), actively linked from the Medical Records page. Includes newer features like an email submission address and a "Last 2 years of records for transfer of care" option.
- **form-2.pdf** (this document) — The older 2013 version, still publicly accessible at its URL but **no longer linked** from the Medical Records page.
- **form-3.pdf** — A Spanish-language translation of form-1, also linked from the Medical Records page.

Form-2 and form-1 share the same form number (000700) and basic structure, confirming form-2 is a superseded predecessor. The older form includes an "Electronic Discharge Instructions" option absent from the newer version, while lacking the newer form's email submission instructions and "transfer of care" record option.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found via a web search for `"San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center medical records release form PDF"` at the URL `https://www.sanluisvalleyhealth.org/documents/Authorization-to-release-medical-record-information.pdf`. It is **not linked from the current Medical Records page** (`/patient-center/medical-records/`), which only links to form-1 and form-3. The form persists as an orphaned document accessible by direct URL or search engine indexing.

The filename (`Authorization-to-release-medical-record-information.pdf`) is descriptive, but its location under `/documents/` rather than `/documents/resource%20flyers/` (where the current forms live) suggests it was not migrated during a site reorganization. A patient searching the web could encounter this outdated version before finding the current one, creating confusion about which form to use.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (3,179 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive PDF form fields. All blanks are represented by underscore characters in the text layer.
- **File size**: 85,783 bytes (84 KB) for a single page — reasonable.
- **Fonts**: 4 fonts embedded.
- **Images**: 1 embedded image (likely a logo or header graphic).
- **Design origin**: This is a digitally created document (not a scan), but designed as a print-and-fill form. The underscore-based blank lines and `(Initial as appropriate)` instructions assume the patient will print, initial, and hand-sign.

The lack of fillable fields means this form cannot be completed digitally. Combined with no mention of electronic submission options (unlike form-1 which includes an email address), the form is print-only in practice.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page — appropriately concise for the information collected.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom structure:
1. Provider identification
2. Patient identification (name, SSN, DOB)
3. Release recipient
4. General authorization with record type checkboxes
5. Dates of care / scope options
6. Expiration options
7. Specific authorization for sensitive conditions
8. Copy usage clause
9. Signature block
10. Facility addresses and contact info

**Clarity issues**:
- The form contains a **spelling error**: `"INFORMATION REQUIRIED"` — should be "REQUIRED."
- The `"PROVIDER"` field label says `"Name & Address of Health Care Facility"` but doesn't clarify whether the patient should fill this in or if it's pre-populated by the facility. The newer form-1 uses the clearer label `"RELEASE FROM"`.
- The expiration section offers three options but has no default — unlike form-1, which defaults to "1 year unless noted otherwise." A patient who fails to initial any expiration option creates an ambiguous authorization.
- The `"USE OF COPIES"` clause (`"A copy of this authorization with my signature thereon (initial one) ( ) MAY; ( ); MAY NOT be used with the same effectiveness as an original"`) places a decision on the patient that most would not understand the implications of.

**Layout**: Text is dense but readable on a single page. The parenthetical initial markers `( )` are functional but visually cluttered. Section headers like `"GENERAL AUTHORIZATION"` and `"SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION"` provide some hierarchy but are not strongly differentiated visually.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a **general release form** designed for releasing records to a third party (`"Release TO: Name & Address of Recipient Agency, Organization or Individual to whom information is to be released"`). There is no version or pathway specifically for a patient requesting their own records. A patient would need to list themselves in the "Release To" field.

**Scope options**: The form offers several record-type options:
- Copy of H&P, Discharge Summary & Operative Reports
- Copy of Outpatient/ER records
- Copy of complete medical record
- Copy of Electronic Discharge Instructions
- "All past admissions or care at this facility" or limited to specific dates/conditions
- An "Other" write-in field

These are reasonable but clinician-oriented (patients may not know what "H&P" means).

**Format/delivery options**: None specified. No mention of electronic delivery, email, fax, or mail preferences. The newer form-1 added `"PLEASE EMAIL RECORDS IF POSSIBLE TO: MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org"` — this older version lacks that entirely.

**Rights language**: No reference to HIPAA § 164.524, patient right of access, or any patient rights explanation. No mention of EHI export or electronic health information.

**SSN collection**: The form requests the patient's Social Security Number. While historically common on medical forms, this creates an unnecessary data exposure risk and may deter patients concerned about identity theft.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: Three options are offered (specific date, 180 days, or purpose-based with patient-specified number of days). No default expiration is stated if the patient fails to initial any option, which could be interpreted as an indefinite authorization — or as an invalid one. The newer form-1 solved this by defaulting to 1 year.

**Sensitive information protections**: The form appropriately requires specific authorization for drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and psychological/psychiatric conditions, with reference to federal regulations on substance abuse records (42 CFR Part 2). The note about the alcohol/drug abuse statement being attached to disclosures is a proper compliance element.

**Barriers**: No notarization requirement. No in-person submission requirement. No fees disclosed or demanded. The form is straightforward in what it requires.

**Disclaimer**: The form states `"San Luis Valley Health is not responsible if lost"` — this vague disclaimer could be read as disclaiming responsibility for records lost in transit, which is an unusual and potentially concerning statement for a patient trusting the organization to handle their PHI.

**Contact**: Lists phone number 719-587-1392 (differs from 719-587-1391 on form-1, possibly reflecting a departmental change or error).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Orphaned outdated form still publicly accessible**: A patient searching the web may find and submit this 2013 form instead of the current 2024 version. The organization has not removed or redirected the old URL. This could cause processing delays, confusion, or use of an authorization that lacks current requirements.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No default expiration**: Unlike form-1 (which defaults to 1 year), this form provides no fallback if the patient fails to initial an expiration option, creating legal ambiguity about the authorization's duration.
- **"San Luis Valley Health is not responsible if lost"** — Unclear what "if lost" refers to. Lost form? Lost records? Lost in mail? This vague disclaimer could concern patients about the safety of their information.
- **PROVIDER field**: The label `"PROVIDER"` with `"Name & Address of Health Care Facility"` doesn't clarify whether the patient or staff should complete this field, given that the facility's own address is printed at the bottom.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Spelling error**: `"INFORMATION REQUIRIED"` — misspelling of "REQUIRED" in a section header.
- **Possible outdated phone number**: Form-2 lists 719-587-1392; form-1 and form-3 list 719-587-1391. If the department number changed, this form directs patients to a potentially wrong line.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Single-page design**: The entire authorization fits on one page, minimizing patient burden.
- **Granular record-type options**: Patients can request specific subsets of records rather than an all-or-nothing approach.
- **Sensitive condition protections**: Proper handling of 42 CFR Part 2 substance abuse records with required specific authorization and federal regulation references.
