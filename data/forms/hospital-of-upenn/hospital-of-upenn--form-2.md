**Organization**: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP), Philadelphia, PA
**Parent System**: Penn Medicine (University of Pennsylvania Health System)
**Document**: form-2.pdf — "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information"
**Source URL**: https://abingtonneurology.com/forms/PDFs/Penn_Medicine_Records_Request.pdf
**Form identifier**: UPHS-099-8, AEL 10/2018

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an older version (October 2018) of Penn Medicine's system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form. It is functionally the same type of document as form-1.pdf (UPHS-099-9, dated December 2020), which is the current official version hosted on Penn Medicine's own website. Both are general-purpose authorization forms for disclosing protected health information to third parties or to the patient themselves — neither is a patient-access-specific request form.

Key differences from form-1 (the current version):
- **Fewer locations listed**: form-2 omits Lancaster General Health and Penn Medicine Princeton Health, and lists "Penn Home Care & Hospice" instead of "Penn Medicine at Home."
- **No fillable fields**: form-2 has 0 fillable form fields, while form-1 has 70.
- **Sensitive records handling**: form-2 uses the older framing of "AIDS/HIV Information / Psychiatric Care/Treatment / Drug or Alcohol Abuse Treatment" with yes/no checkboxes, while form-1 uses updated terminology ("Behavioral Health Visits" and "Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Visits").
- **Larger file size**: form-2 is 313,635 bytes vs. form-1's 175,352 bytes, despite having no fillable fields and no embedded images—suggesting different production tools or embedded resources.

This form was found hosted on a third-party neurology practice's website (abingtonneurology.com), not on Penn Medicine's official site. It represents an outdated version that has been superseded.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **not** found through Penn Medicine's official website. It was discovered on a third-party partner practice's website (Abington Neurology) during web searching. Penn Medicine's official patient access page (pennmedicine.org/patient-resources/policies/patient-access-health-information) links to form-1, the current version.

A patient navigating Penn Medicine's website would not encounter this version. Its availability is an artifact of a partner practice hosting a now-outdated PDF. This is a findability concern in reverse: patients may stumble upon this obsolete form through web search and use it instead of the current version, potentially causing confusion or delays in processing.

The source URL (`abingtonneurology.com/forms/PDFs/Penn_Medicine_Records_Request.pdf`) has a descriptive filename but provides no versioning context — a patient finding it via search would have no way to know it is outdated.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (9,283 characters), making the document searchable and screen-reader parseable.
- **Fillable fields**: None (0 fields). Every field — patient name, address, checkboxes for locations, record types, delivery method, signature — must be completed by hand after printing. This is a significant usability deficit compared to form-1's 70 fillable fields.
- **File size**: 313,635 bytes for a 2-page text-based PDF with no embedded images. This is surprisingly large and may indicate inefficient production or hidden embedded resources.
- **Fonts**: 9 fonts embedded.
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is a print-oriented form. The lack of fillable fields, the "Label Area" placeholder (for affixing a patient label), and the layout all indicate it was designed to be printed and filled in by hand.
- **PDF version**: Not explicitly recorded, but the text layer and font embedding suggest a reasonably modern PDF.

Overall, this form functions as a flat, non-interactive PDF — usable for printing but not for digital completion.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages. Page 1 contains the authorization form itself; page 2 contains detailed instructions for completing the form, addresses for submitting requests to each Penn Medicine hospital, and important notes about fees, processing times, and denial rights. The length is appropriate for the content covered.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → location selection → recipient information → sensitive records consent → record type selection → date range → purpose → delivery method → authorization/signature. Instructions are separated onto page 2, keeping the main form uncluttered.

**Clarity**: The form uses a mix of plain language and legal language. The authorization section is densely worded: *"I understand that information used or disclosed pursuant to this authorization may be subject to redisclosure by the recipient and may no longer be protected by relevant federal and/or state law."* The instructions on page 2 are clearer but still use legal terminology like "emancipated minor" and "decedent's estate" without plain-language glosses.

**Record type granularity**: The form offers 15 specific record type checkboxes plus an "Other Instructions" free-text field, giving patients good control over what is released: Discharge Summary, Operative Report, Lab Reports, Radiology Images/Reports, Discharge Instructions, ER Record, EKG/ECG Cardiac Tests, Abstract, History and Physical, Progress Notes, Clinic Notes, Itemized Billing Record, Consultations, Medication Records, and Radiology Reports (listed separately from Radiology Images).

**Layout issues**: The "All Penn Medicine Locations" checkbox appears to use a filled square (■) while all other checkboxes use an empty box (❑). This may indicate it is pre-checked by default, which could cause patients to inadvertently authorize release from all locations when they only intend one.

**Typography note**: There is a typographical error on page 2: *"This information has been disclosed to you from records whose confidentially is protected by State statue."* — "confidentially" should be "confidentiality" and "statue" should be "statute."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a general authorization form for disclosure, not a patient-access-specific form. The form says *"I request my PHI be released to:"* followed by a blank for "Name of Person or Institution" — it does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a patient authorizing release to a third party. The notes indicate Penn Medicine directs patients wanting their own records to the myPennMedicine patient portal instead.

**Scope options**: Good. Patients can select specific Penn Medicine locations, specific record types (15 options), date ranges, and can opt in/out of sensitive records (HIV/AIDS, psychiatric, substance use). The purpose field offers checkboxes for Legal, Insurance, Personal, and Continuation of Care.

**Delivery method options**: The form offers three delivery methods: US Mail (Paper), CD, and Email (with a note that it is "not secure" and file size limits apply). This is better than many forms that offer only mail, though it lacks a secure electronic delivery option.

**Security warnings**: The form includes a detailed warning about electronic delivery risks: *"I understand that the CD/disc of images are not encrypted and may be accessible to others if the CD/disc is lost or stolen. I also understand that unencrypted email is not secure — and therefore may be intercepted by others."* While transparency about risks is appropriate, the emphasis on insecurity without offering a secure alternative may discourage patients from requesting electronic delivery.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access. The instructions on page 2 do reference federal law regarding denials and the right to have a denial reviewed, but do not cite specific regulations.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or TEFCA.

**Processing time**: Page 2 states Penn Medicine will comply within 30 days for on-site records and 60 days for off-site records, with a possible 30-day extension — consistent with HIPAA requirements.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration**: 180 days from signature. This is a reasonable timeframe — not so short as to be burdensome, not so long as to create privacy risks.

**Revocation**: Clearly stated that revocation must be in writing and does not apply retroactively.

**Treatment not conditioned on signing**: The form explicitly states *"My refusal to sign this authorization will not affect my ability to receive treatment."*

**Fee disclosure**: Page 2 states *"Penn Medicine will charge for copying records in accordance with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware law, as applicable."* It adds that *"Patient Cost for Radiology images and reports will be free of charge."* No specific fee amounts are disclosed, and the reference is to state law rather than HIPAA's cost-based fee limitation for patient access requests. This framing could result in patients being charged more than HIPAA allows if the request is for their own records (patient access) rather than third-party disclosure.

**Fax restriction**: *"Penn Medicine will not send medical information by facsimile unless the information is needed for patient care and delay in the transmission of the information would compromise patient care."* This is a restriction on an otherwise-standard delivery method.

**Denial and appeal**: The form references the right to have a denial reviewed by a licensed health care professional, with contact information for the Penn Medicine Chief Privacy Officer.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Fee framing references state law, not HIPAA patient access fees**: The statement "Penn Medicine will charge for copying records in accordance with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware law" may result in charges exceeding HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient access requests. Since this form is used for both patient access and third-party disclosure without distinguishing between the two, patients requesting their own records may be overcharged.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"All Penn Medicine Locations" appears pre-checked** (■ filled square vs. ❑ empty boxes for individual locations). If this is the default state, patients may unintentionally authorize release from all facilities rather than just the one where they received care.
- **No distinction between patient access and third-party release**: The form is used for both purposes but does not adapt its instructions, fee disclosures, or timelines accordingly. A patient requesting their own records has different rights than someone authorizing third-party disclosure, but the form treats both identically.
- **Outdated location list**: This version omits Lancaster General Health and Penn Medicine Princeton Health, which are included in the current form-1. A patient treated at these facilities who uses this form may face processing delays or confusion.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typographical errors on page 2**: *"whose confidentially is protected by State statue"* contains two errors — "confidentially" should be "confidentiality" and "statue" should be "statute."
- **Outdated form hosted on third-party site**: This October 2018 version (UPHS-099-8) has been superseded by the December 2020 version (UPHS-099-9) but remains publicly accessible with no indication it is outdated. Patients finding it via web search could submit an obsolete form.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular sensitive records consent**: The form separates AIDS/HIV, psychiatric, and substance abuse records with individual yes/no checkboxes, giving patients explicit control over whether these sensitive categories are disclosed. This exceeds what many forms offer.
- **Detailed instructions page**: Page 2 provides thorough guidance on who can sign, where to submit for each hospital, processing timelines, denial/appeal rights, and fee information. This level of instructional detail is uncommon.
- **Free radiology images**: The explicit note that "Patient Cost for Radiology images and reports will be free of charge" is a patient-friendly policy worth highlighting.
