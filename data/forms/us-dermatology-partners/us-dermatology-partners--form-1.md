**Organization:** U.S. Dermatology Partners (Dallas, TX)
**Document:** form-1.pdf (419,388 bytes, 1 page)
**Source URL:** https://www.usdermatologypartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/U.S.-Dermatology-Partners-Records-Request-Form-2020.pdf
**Form title:** "AUTHORIZATION TO USE OR DISCLOSE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION"

---

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a general-purpose authorization form for the use or disclosure of protected health information. It is titled "AUTHORIZATION TO USE OR DISCLOSE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION" and serves as both a patient-access request form and a third-party release authorization. The form includes checkboxes for "Patient Access" alongside "To Doctor," "To Insurance," "To Attorney," and "Other" under the "Purpose of Use/Disclosure" section.

A second document (form-2.pdf) was also found — an older 2019 upload of what appears to be the identical form. Per the retrieval notes, text content between the two is identical; the 2020 version (form-1.pdf) is the one currently linked from the organization's Patient Forms page. Both carry a footer revision date of "Rev 08/2017," suggesting the underlying form content has not been updated since 2017 despite re-uploads in 2019 and 2020.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was **easy to find**. According to the retrieval notes:

- A web search for `"U.S. Dermatology Partners" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` surfaced the PDF directly.
- The organization's website has a dedicated Patient Forms page at `usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/` with a clearly labeled "Medical Records Release" section containing a direct download link.
- The URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/U.S.-Dermatology-Partners-Records-Request-Form-2020.pdf`) is descriptive, including the organization name, document purpose, and year.

No portal login or multi-step navigation was required to access the form. The retrieval difficulty was rated "easy" by the search agent.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present. The document has extractable text (2,518 characters), confirming it is not an image-only scan. The `is_image_only_scan` flag is `false`.

**Fillable fields:** Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being a digital PDF with a text layer and 9 fonts, the form contains no interactive form fields. A patient must print the form to fill it out by hand, or use PDF annotation tools — neither is ideal for a modern digital workflow.

**File size:** 419 KB for a single-page document is moderately large, likely due to the 1 embedded image (presumably the organization's logo). This is not problematic but is larger than necessary for the content.

**Digital-first design:** This is a digitally-created PDF (not a scan), but it was designed for print-and-sign workflow. The lack of fillable fields means it cannot be completed electronically without third-party tools. The form does mention "Electronic (only available in patient portal)" as a delivery method, but this refers to how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself is *submitted*.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** A single page, which is appropriately concise for an authorization form. All fields and disclosures fit on one page without appearing excessively cramped.

**Structure and organization:** The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow:
1. Patient identification (name, DOB, address, phone)
2. Direction of disclosure (two checkboxes: USDP discloses *to* a third party, or a third party discloses *to* USDP)
3. Recipient/sender identification
4. Delivery method (mailed, faxed, electronic via portal)
5. Purpose of disclosure (patient access, doctor, insurance, attorney, other)
6. Date range of records
7. Record type (medical records, billing records, pathology report only)
8. Disclosure duration (one-time vs. continuing for 12 months)
9. Patient rights notices (5 bullet points)
10. Signature block

**Clarity:** The language is mostly clear but leans toward legal/administrative phrasing. The opening line — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure of the named individual's health information as described below" — is standard but not plain language. The patient rights section uses accessible bullet-point formatting with "I understand..." phrasing that is reasonably readable.

**Record type options:** Limited to three checkboxes: "Medical Records," "Billing Records," and "Pathology Report ONLY." There is no option to request all records, no mention of lab results, imaging, or other specific record categories. The "ONLY" emphasis on pathology reports is notable — it implies this is a commonly isolated request type in dermatology practice.

**Date range:** Uses open "From:" and "To:" fields, allowing patients to specify the range of records desired.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form bundles both purposes into a single document. "Patient Access" is one checkbox option among several under "Purpose of Use/Disclosure," but the overall form framing ("I hereby authorize use or disclosure") and structure is oriented toward third-party release. A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access is using the same form as an attorney requesting records for litigation — an authorization is not required for patient access under HIPAA, though organizations commonly use them.

**Delivery options:** Three options are offered:
- "Mailed to above address"
- "Faxed to above #"
- "Electronic (only available in patient portal)"

The electronic option is limited to the patient portal, which may require a separate account setup. There is no option for email delivery or secure download link.

**Rights disclosures:** The form includes five bullet points explaining patient rights:
- Right to receive a copy of the authorization
- Right to inspect records (with note about "a reasonable fee")
- Right to revoke the authorization in writing
- Release of liability for U.S. Dermatology Partners
- Notice that records may include sensitive information (STDs, AIDS/HIV, behavioral/mental health, alcohol/drug abuse)
- Statement that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment

**Right of Access language:** The form does **not** reference HIPAA § 164.524, the Right of Access rule, or any specific legal framework. There is no mention of response time requirements (HIPAA requires 30 days) or patient rights under federal law.

**EHI Export / bulk data:** No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data requests, or any digital-age access mechanisms.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee language:** The form states patients are "entitled to inspect my records and that a reasonable fee may be charged for the records." This is vague — it does not specify what the fee covers, what amount is considered "reasonable," or that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to reasonable cost-based fees. The phrase "a reasonable fee may be charged" could lead patients to believe fees are always applicable, even for patient-access requests where HIPAA limits what can be charged.

**Liability waiver:** The form includes: "I release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure that may arise as a result of the use of the information contained in the Protected Health Information." This is a broad liability release that patients must agree to as part of the authorization — there is no opt-out.

**Continuing disclosure option:** The form offers a "Continuing Disclosure for 12 months" option, which is reasonable and within typical timeframes.

**Submission method:** The form does not specify how it should be submitted (mail, fax, in-person, email). This is an ambiguity — patients have the form but may not know where to send it.

**Revocation:** The revocation language is appropriate: "I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time, except to the extent that release has been made prior to my revocation."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Blanket liability waiver bundled into authorization:** The form requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure" as part of signing. This is bundled into the authorization itself — there is no separate opt-out. For patient-access requests specifically, this seems overreaching since the patient is requesting their own information.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions:** The form provides no address, fax number, email, or instructions for where/how to submit the completed authorization. A patient who downloads and completes the form has no guidance on the next step.
- **Fee language is vague and potentially misleading:** "A reasonable fee may be charged for the records" does not distinguish between patient-access requests (where HIPAA limits fees) and third-party releases. Patients requesting their own records may be deterred or overcharged.
- **"Electronic (only available in patient portal)" is unclear:** It is ambiguous whether this means the patient must already have a portal account, whether this option is for all patients or only established portal users, and what format the electronic records would be delivered in.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo: "IDS" instead of "AIDS":** The sensitive-information disclosure reads: "information relating to sexually transmitted diseases, IDS, or HIV infection." "IDS" is clearly a typo for "AIDS." This error has persisted since at least the 08/2017 revision and through two re-uploads (2019, 2020).
- **Revision date mismatch:** The form footer reads "Rev 08/2017" but was re-uploaded in 2020 with "2020" in the filename, suggesting the content has not actually been revised despite the filename implying otherwise.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Single-page brevity:** The form fits all necessary content on one page without appearing excessively cramped — a respectful use of patient time.
- **Clear voluntary-signing statement:** "I understand that authorizing the disclosure of this health information is voluntary. I can refuse to sign this authorization. I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment." This is unambiguous and well-placed at the end before the signature.
- **Easy online findability:** The form is directly linked from a well-organized Patient Forms page with a clear "Medical Records Release" label — no hunting through nested menus or portal logins required.
