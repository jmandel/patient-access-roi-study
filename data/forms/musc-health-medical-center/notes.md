# MUSC Health University Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `MUSC Health "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — immediately found the direct PDF URL on muschealth.org.
2. **Web search for medical records release**: Searched `MUSC Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found the main authorization form, a MyChart instruction PDF, and a Spanish version.
3. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:muschealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records page at `muschealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`.
4. **Medical records page review**: Visited the MUSC medical records page, which offers multiple pathways: MyChart portal, eRequest (Ciox/Swellbox online tool), and manual PDF form submission.
5. **Spanish form search**: Searched for Spanish version and found it linked from the same domain.

## What Worked

The direct web search was highly effective. MUSC Health publishes their authorization form at a clean, predictable URL under their main domain. The form was easy to find — no bot blocking, no login walls, no JavaScript-rendered pages.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf
- **File size**: 158,878 bytes
- **Description**: The primary "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (English). This is the main ROI form. It includes fields for patient information, records source/destination, types of records, purpose of release, date range, release method (Mail, MyChart, Fax, Encrypted E-mail), and signature/authorization sections. It covers sensitive records (mental health, HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder under 42 CFR Part 2). Multi-purpose form usable for both patient access and third-party release.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://mychart.muschealth.com/mychart/en-us/docs/Med%20Rec%20Request.pdf
- **File size**: 524,775 bytes (5 pages)
- **Description**: Instructional document about how to request medical records via MyChart patient portal. Not an authorization form itself — it's a step-by-step guide with screenshots explaining how patients can use MyChart to request records electronically. Notes that fees apply and some older records may only be available via US Mail.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/spanish-auth-to-release-phi.pdf
- **File size**: 169,216 bytes
- **Description**: Spanish-language version of the Authorization to Release Protected Health Information form ("Autorización para Divulgar Información de Salud Protegida"). Same structure and content as form-1.pdf but in Spanish with bilingual headers.

## Difficulties Encountered

- None significant. MUSC Health makes their forms readily available at stable URLs with no access barriers.
- The organization also offers an online eRequest tool (via Ciox/Swellbox) as an alternative to the PDF form, but that requires identity verification via webcam/smartphone photo of driver's license.

## Additional Notes

- MUSC Health provides three pathways for medical records requests: (1) MyChart portal, (2) Ciox eRequest online tool, and (3) manual PDF authorization form.
- The PDF form supports multiple delivery methods including encrypted email and MyChart.
