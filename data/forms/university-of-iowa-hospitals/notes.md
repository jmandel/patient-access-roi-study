# University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately returned the direct PDF link and the medical records request page.
2. **Site-scoped search** for "site:uihc.org medical records release form authorization" — confirmed the same resources.

The form was very easy to find. The first web search returned a direct link to the official PDF hosted on healthcare.uiowa.edu.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/marcom/uihc/legal/consent-to-release.pdf
- **File size**: 130,005 bytes
- **Description**: Official UIHC "Form 1989: ADMIN – CONSENT TO RELEASE OF INFORMATION AND RIGHT OF ACCESS REQUEST." This is the current, official ROI/authorization form hosted on the University of Iowa Health Care website. It includes patient identification fields, recipient info, format options (electronic CD/USB/email, fax, paper, verbal), record type checkboxes, date range, reason for release, and consent language. References sensitive categories (substance use, mental health, HIV, genetic information). Has a text layer (not image-only).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://irp.cdn-website.com/fa690e1e/files/uploaded/UI%20Medical%20Release%20Form%20fillin-2023.pdf
- **File size**: 93,843 bytes
- **Description**: A fillable version of the same Form 1989, hosted on a third-party CDN (irp.cdn-website.com). This version appears to be pre-populated with a specific recipient ("Safer Driver Solutions" in Richland, IA) and has "Rehab/disability" pre-checked as the reason for release. It is likely a version customized by a third party (driving rehabilitation service) for their clients to authorize UIHC records release. Still the same underlying UIHC form structure. Has fillable form fields and a text layer.
