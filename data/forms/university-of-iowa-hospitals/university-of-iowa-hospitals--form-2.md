# Evaluation: University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **third-party-customized version** of UIHC's standard Form 1989 ("ADMIN – CONSENT TO RELEASE OF INFORMATION AND RIGHT OF ACCESS REQUEST"). It is a 1-page, 93,843-byte fillable PDF hosted on a third-party CDN (`irp.cdn-website.com`), not on the official UIHC website. The form has been pre-populated with a specific recipient — "Safer Driver Solutions: 301 West North St, Richland, IA 52585" — and has "Rehab/disability" pre-checked as the reason for release. The fax number (877-908-0320) and email (office@saferdriver.net) also correspond to this third-party driving rehabilitation service.

Compared to form-1.pdf (the official version hosted at `healthcare.uiowa.edu`, revised 5-2024), this form-2 is an **older revision (8-2021)** of the same underlying form. Key differences: form-1 uses the updated name "UI Health Care," has a slightly different address ("HSSB Ste. 100"), includes additional record categories ("Allergy list," "Formerly Corridor OB GYN," "Formerly Mercy Clinics' records," "Formerly Mercy Hospital records"), a 3-year default expiration (vs. 2-year in form-2), and adds electronic signature validity language. Form-2 lacks fillable field names (the metadata shows 50 fillable fields but no names extracted) while form-1 has zero fillable fields — a reversal where the third-party version is actually more interactive than the official one.

This document is **not the official patient-facing form**; it is a version distributed by a third party to streamline their specific use case (obtaining UIHC records for driving rehabilitation evaluations).

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **not found through the official UIHC website**. It surfaced during web searches, hosted on a third-party CDN (`irp.cdn-website.com/fa690e1e/files/uploaded/UI%20Medical%20Release%20Form%20fillin-2023.pdf`). A patient searching for the UIHC ROI form would not naturally encounter this version — they would find form-1 via UIHC's medical records request page at `uihc.org/medical-records-request`.

The existence of this form on a third-party site is a findability concern in a different sense: a patient who encounters this pre-populated version might be confused about whether it is the correct form for their own access request. The filename ("UI Medical Release Form fillin-2023.pdf") does not clearly identify it as a third-party customization.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present — the form is not an image-only scan. Full text is extractable (3,913 characters).

**Fillable fields**: The form reports 50 fillable fields, making it genuinely interactive as a digital form. However, no field names are captured in the metadata, which suggests the fields may lack proper accessibility labels. This is notable because the official form-1 has zero fillable fields — this third-party version is paradoxically more digitally functional than the official one.

**File size**: At 93,843 bytes for a single page with no embedded images and 8 fonts, the file is reasonably sized.

**Digital-first design**: The form appears to be designed for digital completion, with fillable fields and checkbox interactivity. However, it still requires a wet or electronic signature at the bottom, and the form has no built-in submission mechanism — it must be printed, signed, and sent via email, fax, or mail.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 1 page — appropriate for its purpose. The form is compact and reasonably organized.

**Structure**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient → format → record types → date range → reason → consent language → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. This is a sensible ordering.

**Clarity**: The consent language is moderately dense but covers necessary ground. The sentence "If this consent is cancelled, I understand that information may have been released prior to the cancellation, and that action would not be considered a breach of confidentiality" is clear and appropriately worded. The form does not use plain-language summaries or explanatory headers for each section.

**Record types**: Offers 15 record type checkboxes (summary of record, immunization record, pathology slides, billing information, laboratory results, psychotherapy notes, discharge notes, office visit notes, radiology images, emergency notes, operative/procedure reports, radiology reports, history and physical, pathology reports, test results) plus an "Other" free-text field. This is a comprehensive selection.

**Date range**: Defaults to "previous two years unless specified below" with a date range field. This is a reasonable default.

**Sensitive categories**: Includes opt-out checkboxes for substance abuse, mental health, HIV-related information, and genetic tests/info, with appropriate footnotes explaining 42 CFR Part 2 protections and the scope of genetic testing.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form title includes "Right of Access Request," and the recipient field includes a "Myself at the address above unless noted below" option. However, this version has been pre-populated to send records to Safer Driver Solutions, which undermines the patient-access pathway. A patient using this form for their own access would need to override the pre-filled recipient, which may not be obvious.

**Format options**: Lists electronic (CD/USB drive/MyChart), fax, verbal, email, paper, and "to file only." The inclusion of MyChart is notable (form-1 lists "Email" instead of "MyChart" in the electronic options), suggesting this version may reference a slightly different set of delivery options. The email warning "(Email is not a secure means of communication)" is appropriate.

**Expiration**: The authorization "will expire 2 years from the date of signature, or as indicated." This is shorter than form-1's 3-year default but still reasonable.

**Response time commitment**: "UIHC will respond to this request within 30 days of receipt. If additional time is required, you will be notified of the extension." This matches HIPAA's 30-day response requirement.

**Fee disclosure**: "I understand there may be a charge for this information." This is vague — no fee schedule or cost estimate is provided.

**No mention of HIPAA § 164.524**, patient rights to access, or EHI export/bulk data options.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Conditioning treatment on authorization**: The form states "UIHC does not require completion of this form as a condition of evaluation or treatment" — an important and compliant disclosure. However, it adds an exception: "when the requested evaluation or treatment is solely for the purpose of creating a medical report for a third party, if authorization to release the information to that third party is not provided, it may result in the cancellation of those services." This exception is legally appropriate.

**Cancellation process**: Requires "written notification to the Director of Health Information Management" — this is a standard process, though it could be simpler (e.g., email or phone cancellation).

**Future information release**: "This agreement allows release of past and future UIHC information" — this means signing once authorizes ongoing disclosure for the duration of the authorization period (2 years). This is a broad scope that patients may not fully appreciate.

**Witness requirement**: "Witness signature, only required when patient or person legally authorized is physically unable to sign" — this is reasonable and appropriately limited.

**No notarization required. No in-person-only submission requirement.** Submission channels include email, fax, and mail.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Pre-populated third-party recipient**: The form comes with "Safer Driver Solutions" pre-filled as the recipient, with their fax number (877-908-0320) and email (office@saferdriver.net) already entered. A patient unfamiliar with form customization might not realize this directs their records to a third party. This creates a risk of unintentional disclosure if patients fill out and sign this version without understanding who will receive their information.

- **Blanket future information release**: The consent language "allows release of past and future UIHC information" for up to 2 years is broad. Combined with the pre-populated third-party recipient, a patient could unknowingly authorize ongoing release of all future records to Safer Driver Solutions.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Dual-purpose form confusion**: The form serves both "Consent to Release of Information" (third-party) and "Right of Access Request" (patient self-access), but when pre-populated for a specific third party, the patient access pathway is obscured. It's unclear whether a patient should use this same form to simply request their own records.

- **Fee language is vague**: "I understand there may be a charge for this information" provides no specifics. HIPAA limits fees for patient access requests to a reasonable, cost-based fee, but this form gives no indication of what to expect.

- **"MyChart" appears in electronic format options** on this version but not on the official form-1 (which lists "Email" instead). This inconsistency between versions may confuse patients about available delivery options.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Outdated version**: This form is revised "8-2021" while the official form-1 is revised "5-2024." The organizational name is outdated ("UIHC" vs. the current "UI Health Care"), and the address lacks the "HSSB Ste. 100" detail present in the current version. A patient using this form is submitting an outdated authorization.

- **Hosted on uncontrolled third-party CDN**: The URL (`irp.cdn-website.com`) is not under UIHC's control. The form could be modified without UIHC's knowledge, creating potential integrity and trust issues.

- **Terminology inconsistency**: Uses "substance abuse" while form-1 uses the updated term "substance use" — the latter aligns with current clinical language standards.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **50 fillable form fields**: Despite being a third-party copy, this version is more digitally interactive than the official form-1 (which has zero fillable fields). This demonstrates that the underlying form design supports digital completion.

- **Multiple submission channels**: Email (him-consentform@uiowa.edu), fax (two numbers), and mail are all available — no in-person submission required.

- **Comprehensive record type selection**: 15 specific record categories plus "Other" gives patients granular control over what is released.

- **Clear sensitive-category opt-out**: The mechanism to exclude substance abuse, mental health, HIV, and genetic information is well-structured, with appropriate legal footnotes about 42 CFR Part 2.
