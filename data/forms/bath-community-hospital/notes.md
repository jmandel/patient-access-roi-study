# Bath Community Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Bath Community Hospital
- **Website:** https://bathhospital.org/
- **Location:** Hot Springs, VA
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Bath Community Hospital Hot Springs VA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — initial search did not find a direct hospital-specific form but pointed to the hospital website.
2. **Web search** for `Bath Community Hospital Hot Springs Virginia medical records release form` — found a direct link to the Medical Records Request PDF at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf`.
3. **Website navigation** — visited `https://bathhospital.org/patient-resources/forms/` which lists forms under "Medical Records Request" heading. The link at `https://bathhospital.org/medical-records-request/` redirects directly to the PDF.
4. **Site-specific search** for additional HIPAA authorization forms on bathhospital.org — no additional ROI forms found.
5. **Checked adult new patient packet** — contains a general "Release of Information" consent section as part of intake paperwork (for treatment/payment/operations), but is not a standalone ROI form for requesting medical records.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf
- **Document type:** Medical Records Request / Release of Information form
- **Initial impression:** This is a one-page ROI form branded as "Bath Community Physicians Group" (the affiliated physician practice), not specifically "Bath Community Hospital." It is located at 713 S Monroe Ave, Covington, VA 24426. The form allows patients to authorize sending or receiving records, with checkboxes for record types (ER notes, H&P, operative reports, lab/test results, imaging reports, discharge summary, complete medical record). It includes consent for alcohol/drug abuse/psychiatric records release, a 6-month expiration clause, and requires patient/guardian signature plus a witness signature. The form appears to be a scanned/image-based PDF with OCR text layer (some OCR artifacts like "ERNOTE" instead of "ER NOTE" and "IMAGINE" instead of "IMAGING"). It is not fillable.

## Difficulties
- The hospital's only ROI form is branded under "Bath Community Physicians Group" rather than "Bath Community Hospital" itself. This is common for small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative resources.
- The form appears to be a scan with OCR, not a digitally-created document, evidenced by minor OCR errors in the extracted text.
- Only one ROI-related form was found on the entire website.
