# Evaluation: Guthrie Corning Hospital — form-3.pdf

**Document:** Medical Records Authorization Instructions
**Source URL:** https://www.guthrie.org/sites/default/files/Medical%20Records%20Authorization%20Instructions%20-%20March2022.pdf
**Organization:** Guthrie Corning Hospital (Corning, NY) — community hospital within the Guthrie regional system
**Date on document:** 03.2022

---

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is **not an ROI form itself** — it is a one-page instruction sheet explaining how to complete and submit the separate Medical Record Release form (form-1.pdf). It functions as a companion document providing procedural guidance, contact information for each Guthrie facility, and fee schedules.

In the context of the three documents found for this organization:
- **form-1.pdf** is the primary "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" form
- **form-2.pdf** is a specialized "Release of Patient Information to Family, Friends and Others" form
- **form-3.pdf** (this document) is the instruction/fee schedule supplement

All three are published by the parent Guthrie Clinic system and apply across its facilities (Corning Hospital, Troy Hospital, Robert Packer Hospital, Cortland Hospital, and Guthrie Medical Group clinics).

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this document was "easy to find" — it appeared in web search results for Guthrie medical records forms and is hosted on the main guthrie.org domain. The central medical records page at https://www.guthrie.org/medical-records serves as a hub for all ROI-related documents.

The URL is descriptive (`Medical%20Records%20Authorization%20Instructions%20-%20March2022.pdf`), clearly signaling the document's purpose and date. However, being a separate instruction document rather than instructions integrated into the form itself adds a step — a patient must find and read two documents (instructions + form) to complete the process.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (2,906 characters). This is a natively digital PDF, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (0). This is expected for an instruction sheet, which is informational rather than interactive.
- **File size:** 143,778 bytes (~140 KB) for a single page with no embedded images. Moderately large for the content, likely due to font embedding (7 fonts).
- **Digital-first:** Yes — the document was clearly authored digitally. Clean text rendering, no scan artifacts.
- **Page count:** 1 page.
- **Fonts:** 7 fonts embedded, which is somewhat high for a one-page document but not problematic.

The document functions adequately as a digital artifact. It can be searched, copied, and read by screen readers. Since it's an instruction sheet with no fields to fill, the lack of interactivity is appropriate.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** One page is appropriate for an instruction document of this scope.

**Clarity:** The language is generally clear and readable. The opening paragraph is plain: "The Guthrie Clinic is committed to protecting the privacy of your medical information. To safeguard your privacy, please complete and sign a form to assure the correct records are sent in the desired format." The instructions are procedural and direct: "After printing the form, indicate what records are to be released and where they are to be sent."

**Organization:** The document follows a logical flow:
1. General instructions for completing the form
2. Note about guardians/legal representatives
3. Fee information for electronic records (HIPAA-covered requests)
4. Contact table with facility details (phone, fax, hours, mailing address)
5. Fee schedules for non-HIPAA requests (Pennsylvania and New York state schedules)

**Layout:** The facility contact information is presented in a table format, which is effective. However, the table has some oddities — Corning Hospital, Troy Hospital, and RPH Towanda Campus are grouped together sharing the same phone/fax as Robert Packer Hospital, with the note "No onsite support. Contact Robert Packer Hospital office." This grouping could confuse patients who are specifically looking for Corning Hospital's medical records office.

**Typography:** The document uses bold and caps effectively for section headers ("NOTE:"). The use of ALL CAPS for "NOTE" draws attention to important caveats.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Submission options:** The document states patients may "Return the completed Medical Record Release form (and any attachments) by mail, fax or in person." Three submission channels is good, though no electronic/online submission option is mentioned.

**Fee transparency:** This is the document's strongest patient-facing feature. It explicitly breaks down fees:
- **HIPAA personal-use electronic records:** "$6.50 flat rate fee" — clearly stated and reasonable
- **Records to another provider:** "The Guthrie Clinic will not charge for records if the records are needed to share with another healthcare provider/entity" — explicitly communicated
- **Non-HIPAA requests:** Per-page fee schedules for both Pennsylvania ($1.60/page for pages 1-20, $1.19 for 21-60, $0.41 for 61+) and New York ($0.75/page)

**MyChart reference:** Notes that "Continuation of care requests may also be completed thru your individual eGuthrie/MyChart account," signaling a patient portal option exists — though no detail is given on how to use it for this purpose.

**HIPAA reference:** The document explicitly references the "HIPAA Privacy Rule" in the fee section, connecting the $6.50 flat rate to HIPAA compliance. This is informative for patients.

**EHI Export:** No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Proxy/representative guidance:** The document includes guidance for guardians, estate executors, and power of attorney holders, noting that "you must submit a copy of the appropriate legal document" and that parents on file need no additional documentation. The phrase "Exceptions may apply" is vague but not unreasonable.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee structure:** The $6.50 flat rate for electronic personal-use records is explicitly tied to HIPAA compliance, which aligns with the reasonable, cost-based fee standard under 45 CFR § 164.524. The state fee schedules for non-HIPAA requests (PA and NY) are properly separated from the HIPAA personal-use fee.

**No unreasonable barriers:** The form does not require notarization. Submission is accepted by mail, fax, or in person — no in-person-only requirement. The document does instruct patients to print and sign the form ("After printing the form"), which assumes a print-sign-scan/mail workflow rather than electronic signature.

**Expiration:** Not addressed in this instruction document (the companion form-1.pdf specifies 12-month expiration).

**Photo ID:** Not mentioned in this document (the companion form-1.pdf notes "Photo ID required for records to be picked up").

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Clear fee transparency:** The document does an excellent job of communicating the fee structure, including the HIPAA-compliant $6.50 flat rate for personal electronic records and the explicit statement that provider-to-provider transfers are free. This is more transparent than most organizations.
- **Dual-state fee schedules:** Since Guthrie operates across both Pennsylvania and New York, providing fee schedules for both states is thoughtful and avoids confusion.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **"Exceptions may apply"** after the statement that parents on file need no additional documentation to act on behalf of a child — this is vague and could cause anxiety or confusion for parents.
- **Corning Hospital has "No onsite support"** — the table instructs Corning Hospital patients to "Contact Robert Packer Hospital office," and all mailing goes to "One Guthrie Square, Sayre PA 18840." For a patient of Corning Hospital (in Corning, NY), being directed to a facility in Sayre, PA with no local support may be disorienting and creates a geographic barrier.
- **The phrasing "Requests not covered by the HIPAA Privacy Rule may incur a fee based on applicable state fee schedule"** may confuse patients about which fee applies to their situation. The document doesn't clearly explain what makes a request fall outside HIPAA coverage.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Print-and-sign workflow assumed:** The instructions say "After printing the form, indicate what records are to be released" — there is no option for electronic signature or online submission. Patients without printers must find alternative ways to complete the process. Combined with the lack of fillable fields in the companion form (form-1.pdf), this creates a barrier for digitally-native patients.
