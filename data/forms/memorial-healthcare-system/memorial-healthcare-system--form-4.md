# Evaluation: Memorial Healthcare System — form-4.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is a **Request for Amendment of Protected Health Information** — not a Release of Information (ROI) form. It allows patients to request corrections or additions to their medical records under HIPAA § 164.526. The notes.md confirms it was downloaded from the same Medical Records page (https://www.mhs.net/patients-and-visitors/medical-records) alongside the primary ROI form (form-1.pdf in English, form-2.pdf in Spanish, form-3.pdf in Haitian Creole).

This is a companion document to the ROI forms rather than a substitute or alternative. It addresses a distinct HIPAA right (amendment) rather than the right of access. In the context of the full set found for Memorial Healthcare System, this is a supplementary patient-rights form, not the core ROI authorization.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found on the same Medical Records page as the ROI forms, accessible via the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation on mhs.net. The source URL (`https://www.mhs.net/-/media/mhs/files/patients-and-visitors/request-for-amendment-form.pdf`) has a descriptive filename. The form was directly downloadable without login, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking. Retrieval difficulty was rated "Easy" for the overall set.

Since this form lives alongside the ROI forms on a clearly labeled Medical Records page, a patient looking for amendment rights would likely find it with minimal effort — assuming they know what "amendment" means in this context.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — the PDF has extractable text (4,552 characters).
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive fields despite having clear blanks for patient name, date of birth, facility name, document to amend, and explanation. Patients must print and handwrite.
- **File size**: 1,166,874 bytes (~1.17 MB) for a single page. This is disproportionately large — likely due to embedded images (2 images, 11 fonts). The English ROI form (form-1.pdf) is 2.46 MB for 2 pages, suggesting a system-wide pattern of unoptimized PDFs.
- **Page count**: 1 page according to metadata, though the extracted text contains a large volume of garbled, duplicated, and seemingly unrelated content beyond the actual form — including business card information for multiple staff members (Sharon Kaplan, Michelle Marie Jadotte, Diana Martinez, Raquel Garcia, Nina Beauchesne, Iftikhar Hanif, etc.), therapy services listings, and facility addresses. This suggests the PDF was created from a template that includes hidden or overlapping layers of content from other documents.
- **Digital-first design**: No. This appears to be a designed-for-print form that was exported to PDF. The lack of fillable fields and the presence of a "PATIENT/LABEL" sticker placeholder (indicated by `┌` bracket characters) confirm it was designed for in-facility use where a patient label would be physically affixed.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The form's actual content (the amendment request portion) is reasonably well-organized:

1. **Introductory explanation** — A clear preamble explains that "MHS patients have the right to request that we amend their protected health information if they believe their personal medical records are incorrect or incomplete."
2. **Grounds for denial** — The form transparently lists reasons MHS may deny an amendment request: not in writing, no supporting reason, information not created by MHS, not part of the medical record, not inspectable, or already accurate and complete.
3. **Patient fields** — Facility name, document name, detailed explanation, patient name/DOB/signature/date/address/phone.
4. **Hospital disposition section** — An "Approved/Denied" section with comment field and authorized signature, suggesting the form is designed to be a round-trip document.

However, the extracted text reveals significant problems with the PDF's structure. After the legitimate form content, there is a large block of garbled text including:
- Repeated staff contact information (names, phone numbers, fax numbers, emails)
- Facility listings in mixed case ("MeMoRial ReGional HoSPital SoutH")
- What appears to be content from business card templates ("JDCH Oncology BC (Multiple Doctors & Locations) FRONT" and "BACK")
- Duplicated revision numbers ("2310-10176 (REV 03/2021)" and "2310-10176 REV.(7/16)")
- Department listings ("THERAPY SERVICES", "OUTPATIENT SERVICES", "INPATIENT SERVICES")

This garbled trailing content is likely not visible when the PDF is printed or viewed normally, but it indicates sloppy PDF production — possibly from a template that includes multiple overlapping artboards or hidden layers.

The mailing instructions direct patients to send the form to "Memorial Healthcare System ATTN: Legal Department Privacy Office ATTN: Privacy Director, 3111 STIRLING ROAD, HOLLYWOOD, FL 33312" with email contact at MHSPRIVACY@mhs.net and phone (954) 265-1165. Providing both mail and email contact options is helpful, though the dual "ATTN:" lines in the extracted text suggest formatting confusion.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Strengths:**
- The form clearly states the patient's right to request amendments, which is itself an exercise in patient education.
- It explains what will and won't happen: "Medical records will be amended only through the addition of information... Existing records will not be removed, destroyed, or altered."
- It provides specific guidance on how to request amendments during treatment ("the request may be made to the provider who created the record").
- A privacy office email (MHSPRIVACY@mhs.net) is provided as a contact point.

**Weaknesses:**
- This form is only available in English. Unlike the ROI form (available in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole), the amendment form has no translated versions, creating an access barrier for the same multilingual South Florida population that the ROI forms serve.
- No electronic submission option is mentioned. The form says to "complete the top section of this form and send it to" the legal/privacy office, but doesn't specify whether email submission of the completed form is acceptable or if it must be physically mailed.
- There is no mention of timelines for the organization's response, even though HIPAA requires action within 60 days.
- The form lacks any reference to the patient's right to submit a statement of disagreement if the amendment is denied.

**Scope**: This form is specifically for amendment requests, not record access. It does not overlap with or substitute for the ROI authorization form (form-1). It does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access or any connection to requesting copies of records.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Amendment denial grounds**: The listed denial reasons align with HIPAA § 164.526(a)(2), which permits denial when information wasn't created by the entity, isn't part of the designated record set, isn't available for inspection, or is accurate and complete. The form also correctly notes denial is permitted if "not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request."
- **No mention of patient recourse**: HIPAA § 164.526(d) requires that if an amendment is denied, the covered entity must inform the patient of their right to submit a statement of disagreement and to have the request and denial appended to future disclosures. This form omits any such information.
- **No processing timeline**: HIPAA requires the entity to act on amendment requests within 60 days (with a possible 30-day extension). The form does not mention any timeline.
- **Submission channel ambiguity**: The form provides a mailing address and an email address but does not clearly state whether the form can be submitted via email, potentially creating confusion about acceptable submission methods.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **No mention of patient recourse upon denial**: The form explains when MHS may deny an amendment but omits any reference to the patient's HIPAA right to submit a statement of disagreement or to have the denial appended to future disclosures. This is a material omission of patient rights under § 164.526(d).

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Submission method unclear**: The form provides both a mailing address (3111 Stirling Road) and an email (MHSPRIVACY@mhs.net) but doesn't explicitly state whether the completed form can be emailed or must be physically mailed. The instruction "complete the top section of this form and send it to" is ambiguous.
- **Incomplete sentence in extracted text**: The preamble contains "To request an amendment during treatment, the request may be made to the provider who created the record. To request an ." — the second sentence appears truncated with just a period, suggesting either a PDF rendering issue or an actual content defect.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Garbled hidden content**: The PDF contains extensive hidden or overlapping text from unrelated templates — staff business cards, department listings, facility addresses, and revision markers from other documents. While likely not visible to users viewing the PDF, this pollutes text extraction and accessibility tools. Content includes entries like "JDCH Oncology BC (Multiple Doctors & Locations) FRONT" and mixed-case facility names ("MeMoRial ReGional HoSPital SoutH").
- **Conflicting revision dates**: The extracted text shows both "2310-10176 (REV 03/2021)" and "2310-10176 REV.(7/16)" — two different revision dates for the same form number, suggesting template contamination from an older version.
- **Oversized file**: At 1.17 MB for a single-page form, the file is roughly 10× larger than necessary, likely due to unoptimized images and template bloat.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Plain-language rights explanation**: The opening paragraph clearly explains the amendment right in accessible language: "MHS patients have the right to request that we amend their protected health information if they believe their personal medical records are incorrect or incomplete."
- **Transparency about amendment process**: The form honestly explains that amendments are additive ("Existing records will not be removed, destroyed, or altered"), setting appropriate patient expectations.
- **Privacy office contact information**: Providing a direct email and phone number for the privacy office lowers the barrier for patient questions.
