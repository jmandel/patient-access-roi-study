# Memorial Healthcare System — form-3.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**Document title:** Otorizasyon pou Divilge Dosye Medikal Konfidansyèl (Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records — Haitian Creole)

**Form number:** 2310-10175 (05/21)

**Source URL:** https://www.mhs.net/-/media/mhs/files/patients-and-visitors/2310-10175--authorization-for-release-of-confidential-medical-records--creole.pdf

This is the **Haitian Creole translation** of the English ROI authorization form (form-1.pdf, form number 2310-10173). It mirrors the same structure, sections, and content as the English and Spanish (form-2.pdf, 2310-10174) versions. Memorial Healthcare System provides all three language versions from the same Medical Records page. A fourth document (form-4.pdf) is a separate Request for Amendment form and is not an ROI authorization.

The form is a general authorization for release of confidential medical records — not specific to patient self-access versus third-party release. It covers all MHS facilities including Memorial Regional Hospital, Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, Memorial Hospital West, Miramar, Pembroke, Home Health, Manor Nursing Home, and others.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Rating context:** The retrieval notes indicate the form was **easy to find**. The medical records page at https://www.mhs.net/patients-and-visitors/medical-records is accessible from the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation. The Creole PDF is directly downloadable without login, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking.

The URL is descriptive (includes "authorization-for-release-of-confidential-medical-records--creole"), and the filename on the medical records page clearly identifies it as the Creole-language version. A Haitian Creole-speaking patient would need to navigate an English-language website to locate the form, but the form itself is clearly labeled and grouped with the English and Spanish versions.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size:** 714,409 bytes (~714 KB) for 2 pages — moderately large, likely due to 9 embedded images (logos/headers), but reasonable
- **Text layer:** Present. Full text is extractable (3,684 characters), confirming this is not a scanned image
- **Fillable fields:** **Zero.** The form has no interactive PDF form fields despite having labeled blanks for patient name, date of birth, signature, phone, date, etc. Patients must print and complete by hand
- **Fonts:** 6 fonts embedded
- **PDF structure:** Appears digitally designed (not a scan), with proper text encoding including Haitian Creole diacritical marks (è in "Konfidansyèl," etc.)
- **Page 2:** Based on extracted text, page 2 appears to contain only the header/footer template (patient label area, form number, page indicator) — likely intended for facility contact information or additional space, but the extracted text shows minimal content

The form is a flat, non-fillable PDF. While the text layer is intact and the document is digitally authored, the absence of fillable fields means patients cannot complete it electronically. This is a significant missed opportunity given that the English version also lacks fillable fields — the limitation is consistent across all language versions.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages. Page 1 contains the full authorization content; page 2 appears to be mostly a label/header template. The substantive content fits on a single page, which is appropriate.

**Structure:** The form follows a logical 5-section numbered layout:
1. Facility selection (checkboxes for ~13 MHS locations)
2. Patient identification and authorization statement
3. Record type selection (detailed checklist of ~17 specific record types)
4. Recipient information
5. Acknowledgment statements (a through h)

**Clarity of translation:** The Haitian Creole text reads as a direct translation. Key terminology is rendered in Creole: "Dosye Medikal" (Medical Records), "Dat Nesans" (Date of Birth), "Siyati Pasyan" (Patient Signature). Some English terms are retained where no Creole equivalent is standard (e.g., "MyChart," "CD," "ECG").

**Readability:** The acknowledgment statements in section 5 are dense legal text translated into Creole. Statements like "M konprann ke enfòmasyon ki divilge a dapre Otorizasyon sa a ka sijè a nouvo divilgasyon pa pati ki resevwa li a paske li ka pa gen okenn ankò pwoteksyon lwa federal yo sou vi prive" are complex even for fluent Creole speakers. The reading level is high.

**Delivery method options** are listed at the top of the form: Pran (Pick-up), Poste (Mail), livrezon elektwonik (e-Delivery), CD, MyChart — these appear as checkbox-style options.

**Record type granularity** is good: patients can select specific record types (*Fich Kouvèti, *Rezime Egzeyat, *Sal Ijans, Nòt Pwogrès, etc.) or request "Tout Dosye Medikal" (All Medical Records). The asterisk convention for "Abstract" records is explained.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form is a **general authorization** — it does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting them. Section 4 ("Enfòmasyon sa pou divilge bay:") asks for the recipient's name and address, which could be the patient themselves or someone else. There is no dedicated patient self-access workflow.

**Scope options:** Good. Patients can specify:
- Which MHS facility/facilities (13+ options including "Tout Etablisman Memorial Healthcare System")
- Specific record types from a detailed checklist
- Date(s) of service
- An email address for electronic delivery

**Format/delivery options:** Notable. The form offers five delivery methods: Pick-up, Mail, e-Delivery, CD, and MyChart. The inclusion of e-Delivery and MyChart is a positive feature for patient access.

**Email delivery:** Section 4 includes "M mande pou yo voye dosye m ban mwen nan adrès imel sa a:" — requesting records be sent to a specified email address.

**Rights language:** Section 5g states: "M konprann ke Memorial Healthcare System pa ka kondisyone tretman, peman, enskripsyon oswa kalifikasyon pou benefis nan konplete otorizasyon sa a" — acknowledging that MHS cannot condition treatment/payment on completing the authorization. This is a direct HIPAA reference, though the specific statute (45 CFR § 164.524) is not cited.

**No explicit mention** of HIPAA Right of Access, EHI export, or bulk data access.

**Language accessibility:** The very existence of this Creole-language form is a strong patient-centeredness signal, reflecting Memorial's service to the large Haitian community in South Florida. Having forms in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole is uncommon and commendable.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration:** "Otorizasyon sa a pral ekspire sis (6) mwa apati dat siyati a" — expires six months from signature date, or when revoked, or on a specified date. Six months is a standard and reasonable expiration period.

**Revocation rights:** Clearly stated in section 5a — patients can revoke the authorization at any time in writing.

**Sensitive information disclosure:** Section 5c explicitly notes the authorization covers HIV/AIDS, mental health/behavioral health/psychiatric care, drug/alcohol abuse treatment, and genetic testing results. This is a HIPAA-compliant approach to sensitive categories requiring specific authorization.

**Re-disclosure warning:** Section 5d warns that information may be re-disclosed and lose federal privacy protections.

**Electronic records risk disclaimer:** Section 5e includes an extensive disclaimer about electronic records distribution risks, stating the requestor "asime ak tout konesans epi volontèman risk ak tout konsekans, pèt ak domaj ke sa ta ka lakòz." This shifts liability for electronic delivery risks to the patient, which is notable.

**Marketing disclosure section:** The form includes a marketing authorization section asking whether MHS receives compensation for the disclosure. This is a HIPAA requirement for marketing-related disclosures but is unusual to see on a patient-facing ROI form.

**No notarization requirement.** No in-person submission requirement stated. No fees mentioned on the form itself (notes.md indicates charges per Florida law, but no charge for records sent to treating physicians).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Electronic delivery risk-shifting language (section 5e):** The form requires patients to assume "ak tout konesans epi volontèman risk ak tout konsekans, pèt ak domaj" (knowingly and voluntarily all risk and all consequences, losses and damages) for receiving records electronically. This broad liability waiver could discourage patients from selecting the electronic delivery option and arguably creates a chilling effect on exercising the right to receive records in electronic format under HIPAA § 164.524(c)(2)(ii).

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Patient self-access vs. third-party release unclear:** The form does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and an authorized third party requesting on someone's behalf. This ambiguity means a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed primarily for third-party disclosures.
- **Page 2 content unclear:** The extracted text for page 2 shows only header/footer elements ("PASYAN/ETIKÈT," "PAJ 2 NAN 2"). It is unclear what substantive content (if any) appears on page 2 — the English version (form-1) has extensive facility contact information and physician listings on its second page, but those appear absent from the Creole text extraction.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo in translated text:** Section 5a contains "Memorial Helathcare System" — a misspelling of "Healthcare" as "Helathcare." This error does not appear in the English version (form-1) and suggests inadequate proofreading of the Creole translation.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Haitian Creole language availability:** Providing the ROI form in Haitian Creole is rare among U.S. healthcare systems and demonstrates meaningful commitment to language access for South Florida's Haitian community. Most organizations offer at most English and Spanish.
- **Multiple electronic delivery options:** Offering e-Delivery, CD, and MyChart as delivery methods alongside traditional pick-up and mail is strong for patient access.
- **Granular record type selection:** The detailed checklist of ~17 specific record types with date-of-service fields gives patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.
- **Non-conditioning statement:** Explicit acknowledgment (section 5g) that MHS cannot condition treatment or benefits on completing the authorization — a patient-protective statement that many forms omit.
