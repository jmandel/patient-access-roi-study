2. Web search for `site:brownhealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the main form URL and found the updated 2024 version, plus the medical records request page at https://www.brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records.

## Difficulties
- None. Forms were easily discoverable via web search and directly downloadable as PDFs without any bot blocking or login requirements.

## Additional Notes
- The system recently rebranded from "Lifespan" to "Brown University Health" / "Brown Health". The 2024 form reflects the new branding while the imaging form still uses "Lifespan" branding.
- A dedicated medical records page exists at https://www.brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records with instructions and contact information.
- There is also a Neuropsych-specific release form and a Brown Medicine (physician group) form, but those are for distinct affiliated entities rather than Rhode Island Hospital proper.
