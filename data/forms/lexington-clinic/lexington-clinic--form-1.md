## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is Lexington Clinic's current (2024-updated) Authorization for the Release of Medical Records. It is co-branded with VitalChart, a third-party ROI processing vendor. The form is a general-purpose release authorization — it does not distinguish between patient-access requests (HIPAA Right of Access) and third-party release requests. It serves both use cases through the same workflow.

A second form (form-2.pdf) is also hosted on the site — a 2014-era "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" that covers similar ground but is older and simpler. The 2024 form (form-1) appears to be the current, actively promoted version based on its URL path date and its placement on the Patient Forms page.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was very easy to locate. A straightforward web search for `Lexington Clinic Lexington KY "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF` returned direct PDF links on the first result. The form is also linked from the Patient Forms page at `lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms`. The URL is descriptive (`ROI-Auth-Updated-2024_May23-update.pdf`), though somewhat technical — a patient might not recognize "ROI" as "Release of Information." No login, bot-blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present and fully extractable (3,481 characters). This is not an image-only scan.

**Fillable fields:** Zero interactive form fields despite the PDF being digitally composed (3 fonts, 2 embedded images — likely a logo and decorative element). The form has blank lines and checkbox-style labels but no actual PDF form fields. A patient would need to print, hand-fill, and scan/mail/fax this form — or use a PDF annotation tool.

**File size:** 136 KB for a single page is moderately heavy, likely due to the embedded images. Not problematic for download but heavier than expected for a 1-page text-heavy form.

**Digital-first design:** This is a digitally composed document (not a scanned paper form), but it is designed with a print-and-fill workflow in mind. The absence of fillable fields is a significant missed opportunity given that the PDF was clearly created digitally.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** One page — appropriately concise for an authorization form.

**Organization:** The form uses a clear numbered structure with six sections:
1. Patient demographics
2. Delivery destination and method
3. Record type selection
4. Purpose of disclosure
5. Fee schedule
6. Patient signature and legal disclosures

This logical flow is well-designed — it moves from "who" to "where" to "what" to "why" to "cost" to "sign."

**Clarity:** The form uses relatively plain language. Section headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are conversational and patient-friendly. However, the legal disclosures in Section 6 shift to dense HIPAA boilerplate ("I understand information used/disclosed pursuant to this authorization may be subject to re-disclosure by the recipient..."), which is standard but less accessible.

**Layout:** Fitting six sections plus legal text onto a single page makes it somewhat dense. The delivery options (a. mail, b. email, c. fax) are organized clearly with an instruction to "PLEASE CHOOSE ONLY ONE OPTION (A, B OR C)." The record type section offers checkboxes for specific provider selection, date ranges, specific conditions, and record subtypes (labs, radiology, office notes, immunizations, operative reports).

**Readability:** Three fonts are used, and based on the text density, font size is likely adequate but tight given the single-page constraint.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form does not distinguish between these two use cases. The "Purpose of Disclosure" section offers "Personal Use," "Transfer/Continuity of Care," "Litigation/Legal," and "Other." Selecting "Personal Use" effectively signals a Right of Access request, though the form never explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 or a patient's right of access.

**Scope options:** Good granularity. Patients can select:
- Specific providers or "All Clinic Providers"
- Associate practices (with a fill-in field)
- Date ranges or "All dates of treatment"
- Specific conditions/injuries
- Record subtypes: Ambulatory Surgery Center Records, Labs/Path Only, Radiology Reports Only, Office Notes Only, Immunization Records, Other
- Sensitive records: "Records including mental health, HIV, and/or substance abuse records (cross out any item you do not authorize disclosure.)"

**Delivery options:** Three methods are offered:
- a. Mail to an address
- b. Email
- c. Fax (marked "Healthcare Providers Only")

Email availability for patients is a positive. However, fax is restricted to healthcare providers, and there is no mention of electronic portal access, patient portal download, or EHI export.

**Rights language:** The signature section includes standard HIPAA language about the right to revoke, non-conditioning of treatment on signing, and re-disclosure risk. It does not explicitly inform patients of their right to access their own records under HIPAA.

**EHI/bulk data:** No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or bulk data access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee schedule:** Section 5 states: "Per KRS 422.317, patients are entitled to the first copy of their medical record free of charge. Each additional copy shall be $1.00 per page." It also notes "Records transferred directly to another healthcare entity are free of charge" and "There is no additional charge for records emailed, faxed or picked up at facility." Fees are processed by VitalChart, not Lexington Clinic directly. The Kentucky statute reference is appropriate, and the first-copy-free provision is patient-friendly.

**Late fees:** The form states "payments received after 30 days are subject to $5.00 late fee" and "fees are non-refundable once services are rendered." This applies to the VitalChart invoice.

**Expiration:** "This authorization expires in 1 year from date of signature unless a specific date/event is listed." One year is standard and reasonable.

**Submission:** The form lists submission via mail to "Lexington Clinic Release of Information c/o VitalChart · 791 Freight Blvd., Suite 150 · Lexington, KY 40511" with phone, fax, and email contact info for VitalChart. The form itself does not explicitly state *how* to submit it (mail, fax, email, or in-person), but the VitalChart contact info implies these channels are available.

**Employee restriction:** "LC Employees: This authorization does not permit usage of our computer systems to access your or a family member's PHI." This is an internal compliance safeguard.

**SSN collection:** The form asks for SSN (formatted as "XXX-XX-____" suggesting last 4 digits) and MRN. Collecting even partial SSN for a records release is worth noting.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **$1.00 per page for additional copies:** While the first copy is free per Kentucky law, the $1.00/page charge for subsequent copies may exceed HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based fee" limit for Right of Access requests under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4), which caps fees at the cost of labor for copying plus supplies and postage — typically well below $1.00/page. The form does not distinguish between patient-access fee rules (HIPAA) and third-party release fee rules (state law), potentially overcharging patients exercising their federal right of access.
- **$5.00 late fee and non-refundable fees language:** Imposing a late fee on patients requesting their own records and stating fees are "non-refundable once services are rendered" introduces financial friction that is not contemplated by HIPAA's Right of Access provisions.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Form submission method unclear:** The form provides VitalChart's mailing address, phone, fax, and email at the bottom but never explicitly instructs patients on how to submit the completed form. A patient may be unsure whether they can email the completed form or must mail it physically.
- **Fax restricted to "Healthcare Providers Only":** The fax delivery restriction in Section 2 is noted only parenthetically — a patient might not notice and might try to request fax delivery to themselves.
- **"Cross out any item you do not authorize disclosure"** for sensitive records (mental health, HIV, substance abuse) is awkward on a non-fillable digital form — patients completing this electronically cannot physically "cross out" text.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **No fillable fields despite digital composition:** The PDF has a text layer and was created digitally (not scanned), yet contains zero interactive form fields. This is a technical deficiency — the form *could* easily support fillable fields but doesn't.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **First copy free with clear statutory citation:** The explicit reference to KRS 422.317 and the statement that the first copy is free is transparent and patient-friendly.
- **Email delivery available to patients:** Offering email as a delivery option (not just mail or fax) is a meaningful accessibility improvement over many provider forms.
- **Conversational section headers:** Headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are unusually approachable for a medical-legal form.
- **Good record-type granularity:** Patients can request specific record types, date ranges, and providers — enabling targeted requests rather than forcing all-or-nothing disclosure.
