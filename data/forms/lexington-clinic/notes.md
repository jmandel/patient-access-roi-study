# Lexington Clinic — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Lexington Clinic
- **Website:** https://lexingtonclinic.com
- **Location:** Lexington, KY
- **Type:** Independent physician practice (for-profit)

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search** for `Lexington Clinic Lexington KY "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links and the patient forms page.
2. **Site-scoped search** for `site:lexingtonclinic.com authorization release medical records` — confirmed the same URLs.

The forms were very easy to find. The web search returned direct PDF download links on the first try, and the patient forms page (https://lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms) clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form.
