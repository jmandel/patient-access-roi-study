## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities** — a single-page informational document listing 11 patient rights and 6 patient responsibilities. It is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) or Authorization form. It contains no fillable fields, no signature lines, and no mechanism for requesting records.

Franklin Primary Health Center published three documents in total, none of which is a dedicated ROI form:
- **Form 1** (New Patient Packet, 8 pages): Registration materials including a brief "Assignment and Release" clause limited to insurance billing
- **Form 2** (Notice of Privacy Practices, 6 pages): Standard HIPAA NPP describing patient rights to access records
- **Form 3** (this document): Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, referencing the right to access records in general terms

This document's relationship to ROI is tangential — it mentions record access as a patient right but provides no actionable pathway to exercise that right.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The document was **not discoverable through standard ROI search strategies**. Per the retrieval notes, five different Google search queries using terms like "authorization," "release," "medical records," and "release form" yielded no results. Website navigation, sitemap analysis, URL guessing across 14 filename patterns and 8 upload directories, and Wayback Machine searches all failed to locate any ROI form.

This document was found at a direct URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FPHC-Patient-Bill-of-Rights-and-Responsibilities.pdf`) during a comprehensive scan of all PDF links across the website. The filename is descriptive of the actual content. However, a patient looking for a way to request their medical records would not logically look for or find this document in that search, and even if they did, it offers no instructions on how to proceed.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (2,254 characters).
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. This is a read-only informational document.
- **File format:** 273 KB for a single page with 2 embedded images and 5 fonts — moderately sized but reasonable.
- **Digital design:** The document appears to be digitally authored (not a scan). It uses clean fonts and a structured layout. However, it is purely informational with no interactive elements.

The document is technically accessible as a readable PDF, but since it is not a form, technical form characteristics (fillable fields, submission mechanisms) are not applicable.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The document is concise and well-organized for its purpose. It uses a clear two-section structure:

1. **Rights** (11 bullet items) — covering respect, non-discrimination, confidentiality, record access, provider choice, informed consent, representation, refusal of treatment, staff identification, service information, and grievance processes.
2. **Responsibilities** (6 bullet items) — covering truthful information, treatment compliance, condition reporting, appointment keeping, financial obligations, and rule adherence.

The language is plain and accessible. Sentences are short and active. For example: "To review and have copies of your medical records and to request your record be amended." There is a minor grammatical error ("to received high quality health care" instead of "to receive"), but overall readability is good. The document closes with the organization's mission and vision statements.

At one page, the length is appropriate for its purpose. Layout appears clean with adequate spacing.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This document **acknowledges** two key patient rights relevant to records access:
- "To be assured of confidential treatment and to authorize the release of identifiable health care and other personal information."
- "To review and have copies of your medical records and to request your record be amended."

However, it provides **no actionable guidance** on how to exercise these rights — no phone number for medical records, no form to fill out, no reference to the patient portal (EPIC/MyChart via OCHIN), no mention of where to submit a request, and no indication of applicable fees or timelines. A patient reading this document learns they have a right but receives no help in exercising it.

There is no mention of:
- Electronic delivery or format options
- HIPAA § 164.524 or any legal citation
- Specific record types available
- Date range selection
- EHI export or bulk data access

## 6. COMPLIANCE

As an informational document rather than a form, compliance considerations are limited. The rights listed are generally consistent with HIPAA requirements. The document does not impose any barriers, requirements, or conditions on records access because it does not address the process at all.

The absence of an actual ROI form on the organization's website is itself the notable compliance concern — patients cannot initiate records requests online. The retrieval notes indicate that "Patients would need to contact the center directly at (251) 432-4117 or visit in person to obtain an ROI form, or potentially use the EPIC/MyChart patient portal."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- The document states patients have the right "to authorize the release of identifiable health care and other personal information" — this frames record release as something the patient *authorizes* (suggesting third-party release) rather than something the patient *requests* (their own right of access). The framing conflates two distinct HIPAA pathways.
- No guidance on how to act on any of the enumerated rights. A patient knows they have rights but has no next step.

### ❌ ERRORS
- Grammatical error in the first right: "to received high quality health care" should be "to receive."

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- Franklin Primary Health Center does not publish **any** ROI or medical records request form online. This document, which merely lists the right to access records without any mechanism to do so, is the closest thing available. Patients are effectively required to call or visit in person to even begin the records request process, creating an unnecessary barrier to exercising their HIPAA right of access.
