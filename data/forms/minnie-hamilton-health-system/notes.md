## Search Strategies

### 1. Web searches (multiple queries)
- `"Minnie Hamilton Health System" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No results
- `"Minnie Hamilton Health System" "medical records" "release form"` — Found that MHHS uses ChartRequest platform
- `site:mhhs.healthcare authorization release medical records` — No form PDFs found
- `"Minnie Hamilton Health Care Center" "release of information" form` — No form found
- `"mhhs.healthcare" filetype:pdf authorization release` — No results
- `Mon Health "release of information" form PDF` — Found Mon Health Medical Center authorization form

### 2. Website navigation
- Visited https://www.mhhs.healthcare/patients/ — Main patient page
  - Links to ChartRequest platform for medical records requests
  - No downloadable ROI/authorization form available
  - Contact: Medical Records at (304) 354-9700, ext. 2521
- Checked all pages in sitemap — no forms/patient-forms page exists
- Privacy Policy page is an HTML page (not PDF), contains standard HIPAA NPP text

### 3. Wayback Machine / archived PDFs
- Searched Wayback Machine CDX API for all PDFs on mhhs.healthcare
- Found 12 PDFs total — none are ROI/authorization forms
- Old domain (minniehamilton.com) only had an employment application PDF

### 4. ChartRequest platform
- Navigated to https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville
- This is a third-party electronic records request portal
- Patients must create an account to request records
- The release form is integrated into the ChartRequest online workflow — not available as a standalone download
- No downloadable PDF form is provided through ChartRequest

### 5. Parent system (Mon Health)
- MHHS is an affiliate of Mon Health (Morgantown, WV)
- Mon Health Medical Center has a downloadable PDF authorization form
- The Mon Health form is specifically branded for "Mon Health Medical Center (MHMC)" — not for MHHS
- Downloaded as form-2.pdf for reference

## Difficulties Encountered
- **No standalone downloadable ROI form exists** for Minnie Hamilton Health System
- MHHS has fully outsourced their medical records request process to ChartRequest, a third-party platform
- The ChartRequest platform requires account creation to access any forms — the authorization form is embedded in the online workflow
- The MHHS website has no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section
- The Mon Health authorization form (form-2.pdf) is specifically branded for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — it is NOT the form used by MHHS

## Summary
Minnie Hamilton Health System does not publish a downloadable ROI/authorization form on their website. They direct all medical records requests through ChartRequest (https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville), where the release form is part of the electronic workflow. The only related downloadable form found was from their affiliate system, Mon Health Medical Center, which is a separate facility in Morgantown, WV.
