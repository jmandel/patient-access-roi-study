# NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately surfaced the NYP medical records page and several direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for "site:nyp.org authorization release medical records" — confirmed URLs and revealed campus-specific forms (Lawrence, Jay Monahan Center).
3. **Navigated to** https://www.nyp.org/patients-visitors/medical-records — the main medical records page. This was the authoritative source for all forms. Easy to find: Home → Patients & Visitors → Medical Records (2 clicks).

The medical records page offers:
- Electronic submission via Verisma portal (separate links for Patient, Patient Representative, Attorney)
- Paper authorization form (the "Tripartite" NYP/Columbia/Weill Cornell consortium form) available in English, Spanish, and Chinese via nyp.widen.net
- An FAQ document about obtaining medical records

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf

- **Description**: "NY Consortium HIPAA Auth" — the main Tripartite ROI/HIPAA Authorization form shared across NYP, Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). 2-page form covering patient info, recipient info, request reason, disclosing entity selection (all NYP campuses plus outpatient/physician offices), information to be released (with checkboxes for specific record types), sensitive information authorization (alcohol/drug, HIV/AIDS, mental health, genetic testing), release method options (paper, fax, email, CD, flash drive, patient portal), and authorization/signature section. Rev. 10/2/2019.
- **Initial impression**: This is the primary ROI authorization form for the entire NYP system.

- **Initial impression**: Not an ROI form itself, but a supplementary FAQ document about the ROI process.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.nyp.org/documents/lawrence/patients-visitors/auth-to-disclose-phi-lawrence.pdf
- **Size**: 257,716 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information/Medical Records" — appears to be an older or campus-specific version of the authorization form (Lawrence campus path in URL). Similar content to form-1 but different layout. Lists NYP campus options including Columbia, Weill Cornell, Westchester, Lower Manhattan, Lawrence, and Other.
- **Initial impression**: A variant/older version of the ROI authorization form, possibly campus-specific to NYP/Lawrence.

## Difficulties Encountered

- The main paper form (form-1) was hosted on nyp.widen.net (a DAM platform). The initial link (https://nyp.widen.net/s/qgjgxkfrwp/tripartite-roi-hipaa-authorization_english) served an HTML landing page with an embedded PDF viewer, not the raw PDF. Had to use browser to extract the actual PDF download URL.
- NYP also offers electronic submission via Verisma portal (vra.verisma.com) which is a web-based form completion system, not a downloadable PDF. These are the preferred/primary method per the website.
- Overall, findability was straightforward — the medical records page is easily accessible and well-organized.
