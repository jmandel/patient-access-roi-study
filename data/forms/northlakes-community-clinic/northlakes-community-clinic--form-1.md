**Organization**: NorthLakes Community Clinic (Ashland, WI)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "Release of Information" form, identified as REG-002 / NLCC-ExtROI0-1223 and dated December 2023. It is the newer of two ROI forms published by NorthLakes Community Clinic. The companion document (form-2.pdf, "Health Information Release," dated 4/2022) is an older fillable version covering similar ground. form-1.pdf appears to be the current primary external ROI form, superseding form-2.pdf based on its more recent date and updated filename convention.

The form is a general-purpose authorization covering both patient-directed and third-party releases. It does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access and a patient authorizing disclosure to a third party.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Rating: Easy**

The form was immediately discoverable via web search for `NorthLakes Community Clinic "medical records" "release form"`. Both ROI forms are hosted as direct PDF links on the organization's website under the medical records page (https://nlccwi.org/for-our-patients/medical-records/). No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or login was required. The URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ExternalROI-122023.pdf`) is reasonably descriptive — "ExternalROI" clearly indicates its purpose, and the date stamp (122023) signals recency. Retrieval difficulty was rated "Easy" in the search notes with no barriers encountered.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The form has extractable text (4,308 characters), confirming it is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero**. Despite being a relatively recent form (12/2023), it has no interactive form fields. All blanks are drawn with underscores (e.g., "Patient Legal Name ___________________________"). This is a significant regression from form-2.pdf, which has 54 fillable fields. A patient downloading this PDF would need to print it, complete it by hand, and scan/fax it back.
- **File format**: 197 KB single-page PDF with 7 fonts and 1 embedded image (likely a logo). Reasonable file size.
- **Digital-first design**: No. The form is clearly designed for print-and-fill workflows. The fax-first submission instructions ("Please fax to 715-318-5644") reinforce this. However, the form does mention an encrypted email option for delivery of records to the patient, which is a partial concession to digital workflows.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure and Organization**: The form uses a numbered section layout (1–6) covering Personal Information, Release Purpose, Release FROM, Release TO, Release Type, and Authorization/Signature. The logical flow is reasonable — patient identification first, then directionality, then content selection, then consent.

**Density**: All content is compressed onto a single page, which makes it compact but visually crowded. The sections for release type (6a for Health Records and 6b for Mental Health/Substance Use/Psychiatry) are particularly dense, with small fonts and tightly packed checkboxes.

**Clarity of language**: The authorization statements (the bullet-pointed consent section) are reasonably clear, using "I understand that..." constructions rather than opaque legal jargon. Key rights are articulated:
- "The disclosure of this health information is voluntary and I may decline to sign this authorization."
- "NorthLakes Community Clinic will not condition treatment on whether I sign this authorization."
- "I have a right to request a copy of the signed authorization and to inspect and receive a copy of the information disclosed."

**Record selection**: The form offers granular record-type checkboxes including Progress Notes, Lab Reports/Pathology, Medication List, Radiology Reports, Radiology Images, HIV/AIDS, STD, Entire Medical File, Entire Dental File, and OT/PT/ST Evaluation. Mental health and substance use records are separated into section 6b with their own date range and sub-categories (Progress Notes, Assessment/Evaluation, Discharge Summary, Entire File) for each of Mental Health, Substance Use Treatment, and Psychiatry.

**Date ranges**: Section 6a includes a start/end date range and notes "For continued care the last 2 years of records will be sent unless a different time frame is specified." Section 6b marks its date range as "REQUIRED."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form does not distinguish between these use cases. The "Release FROM" and "Release TO" structure frames the interaction as moving records between organizations, not as a patient exercising their Right of Access. A patient requesting their own records would need to put NorthLakes in the "FROM" field and themselves in the "TO" field — workable but not intuitive for self-directed requests.

**Delivery options**: The "Release TO" section includes an email address field with the note "(NorthLakes will use encrypted email for security purposes)," which is a positive digital delivery option. The primary submission channel is fax, with an urgent fax number also provided ("For urgent requests requiring a response within a week, please fax to 715-318-5635").

**Scope options**: Good. Patients can select specific record types, specify date ranges, and choose between health records and behavioral health/substance use records separately. The "Verbal Communication" checkbox offers an alternative to written record transfer.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access by name. It references "Federal Privacy Law (42 CFR Part 2) (HIPAA)" and "HIPAA 45 CFR" in the context of re-disclosure warnings and substance use record protections, but these citations are about confidentiality protections rather than patient access rights.

**EHI Export / bulk data**: No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or bulk data access.

**Purpose options**: The form offers purpose checkboxes including "Continued Care," "Disability," "Legal," "School," "Transfer Care," "Work Comp," and "Self/Personal." The inclusion of "Self/Personal" is positive for patient-directed requests.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: "This authorization will expire one year from my signature date unless I revoke it." One year is a reasonable and standard expiration period.

**Revocation**: The form states the authorization "may be revoked at any time by providing written notice of revocation to NorthLakes Community Clinic, except when information has already been released." This is standard.

**Treatment conditioning**: The form explicitly states "NorthLakes Community Clinic will not condition treatment on whether I sign this authorization," which is correct and required.

**Minor consent requirements**: The form specifies dual-signature requirements for minors: "For Substance Use Treatment patients 12 and older, both patient and parent/legal guardian must sign" and "For Mental Health and Psychiatry patients 14 and older, both patient and parent/legal guardian must sign." These align with Wisconsin state law.

**Re-disclosure warning**: The form warns that "Information used or disclosed pursuant to this authorization may be subject to re-disclosure by the recipient and may no longer be protected by the Federal Privacy Law (42 CFR Part 2) (HIPAA)." This is standard.

**No notarization, no fee disclosure, no in-person requirement**: The form does not impose notarization, does not mention fees, and does not require in-person submission. The fax-based workflow is the default but not framed as the only option.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **No fillable fields on the newer form**: form-1.pdf (12/2023) has zero fillable fields while the older form-2.pdf (4/2022) has 54. The organization appears to have regressed in digital accessibility by publishing a non-interactive replacement for a fillable form. Patients must print, hand-fill, and fax/scan this form.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **No distinction between patient access and third-party release**: The form's "Release FROM" / "Release TO" framing treats all requests as third-party transfers. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for inter-organizational information exchange, with no guidance on how to use it for self-directed access.
- **Parenthetical HIPAA citation is confusing**: The text "Federal Privacy Law (42 CFR Part 2) (HIPAA)" incorrectly implies that 42 CFR Part 2 is part of HIPAA. 42 CFR Part 2 governs substance use disorder records and is a separate federal regulation from HIPAA. This could confuse patients about which protections apply to their records.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Encrypted email delivery option**: The inclusion of an email field with the note that "NorthLakes will use encrypted email for security purposes" is a meaningful digital delivery pathway that many organizations do not offer.
- **"Self/Personal" purpose checkbox**: Explicitly listing self-directed requests as a valid purpose reduces friction for patients seeking their own records.
- **Clear non-conditioning statement**: "NorthLakes Community Clinic will not condition treatment on whether I sign this authorization" is prominently placed and clearly worded.
- **Granular behavioral health separation**: The form separates Mental Health, Substance Use Treatment, and Psychiatry records into distinct categories with individual checkboxes, giving patients fine-grained control over sensitive disclosures.
