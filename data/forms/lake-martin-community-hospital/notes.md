## Result

**No ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form was found online.**

The hospital's FAQ explicitly states that records can be requested through the Health Information Management department with a signed authorization form, but the form itself is not published on the website. The patient portal (MedConnect) mentions "View/Complete Forms" as a feature, suggesting forms may only be available to authenticated portal users.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The Ivy Creek Healthcare website is relatively bare-bones — no patient forms section, no downloadable documents section
- No historical website archives exist for the hospital under any prior domain
- The hospital appears to handle ROI requests entirely offline or through the patient portal login

## Downloaded PDFs
None — no forms were found to download.

## Retrieval Difficulty
**Impossible** — The form is not published on the public-facing website.
