# Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers (BJKPHC)
- **Website**: https://phcenters.org
- **Location**: St. Louis, MO
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit
- **Parent org**: People's Family of Corporations (https://peoplesfamilystl.org)

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI/authorization form PDFs**: Multiple searches including `"People's Health Centers" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf`, `site:phcenters.org authorization release`, and variations. None returned a downloadable ROI form.

2. **Direct website navigation**: Browsed phcenters.org via Chrome DevTools. The site has pages for About, Services, Locations, Careers, Education, Contact. Found a dedicated "Requests for Release of Health Information" page at https://phcenters.org/release-of-health-information/.

3. **Release of Health Information page**: This page provides only contact information for submitting records requests — no downloadable form:
   - Fax: (314) 367-8009 (Main), (314) 367-2025 (Behavioral Health)
   - Mail: 5701 Delmar Blvd, St. Louis MO 63112
   - Patient Portal: Medfusion/NextGen portal login
   - In-person: Photo ID required

4. **WordPress uploads directory crawl**: Directory listing was enabled on phcenters.org. Systematically crawled all upload directories across sites/2, sites/3, sites/4 for years 2022-2026, all months. Found ~30 PDFs total (newsletters, benefits booklets, scholarship applications, flyers, etc.) but zero ROI/authorization forms.

5. **Parent organization site (peoplesfamilystl.org)**: Checked HIPAA notice page and Patient Rights page. Found links to two PDFs:
   - HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP-2.pdf) — successfully downloaded
   - Patient Rights and Responsibilities (2019) — returns 500 Internal Server Error

6. **Wayback Machine**: Checked CDX API for all PDFs ever archived from phcenters.org. Found ~17 historical PDFs, none of which are ROI/authorization forms. Also checked archived versions of the release-of-health-information page — it has always been text-only instructions with no form link.

7. **Google/Bing searches with various queries**: Multiple attempts with different search terms all confirmed no publicly available ROI form.

## What Was Found

### No ROI Form Available Online
Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers does **not** publish a downloadable ROI/Authorization form on their website. The organization's approach is to handle records requests through:
- In-person visits (photo ID required)
- Fax or mail submissions
- Patient portal (login required)

There is no publicly accessible PDF, Word document, or online form for authorizing release of health information.

### Downloaded Documents

#### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://peoplesfamilystl.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NPP-2.pdf
- **Document type**: HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices
- **Pages**: 10
- **Description**: The organization's Notice of Privacy Practices as required by HIPAA. Describes how PHI may be used/disclosed, patient rights regarding PHI, and organizational obligations. This is NOT an ROI form but is the most closely related publicly available document.

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **No downloadable ROI form exists**: The primary difficulty — the organization simply does not publish this form online.
2. **Patient Rights PDF broken**: The Patient Rights and Responsibilities PDF at peoplesfamilystl.org returns a 500 Internal Server Error, suggesting the file has been deleted or corrupted on the server.
3. **Limited online presence for patient forms**: Despite having a dedicated "Release of Health Information" page, it only provides submission channels (fax, mail, in-person, portal) without a downloadable form.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard/Impossible

No ROI form was found despite exhaustive searching. The organization appears to only distribute the form in-person or through their patient portal (which requires login credentials).
