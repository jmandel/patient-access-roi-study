# Evaluation: Gastro Florida — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**Document type:** Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)
**Effective date:** 1/1/2026
**Pages:** 7 | **File size:** 321,624 bytes | **Fillable fields:** 0

This is a full-length Notice of Privacy Practices, updated for 2026. It is **not** a Release of Information or authorization form — it is an informational document describing how the organization uses and discloses PHI and outlining patient rights under HIPAA.

Gastro Florida has three downloaded documents. Form-1 is the new patient registration packet (which contains a brief embedded "Authorization to Release Information" clause for third-party payors/providers). Form-2 is an older, single-page NPP summary (effective June 2020, listing HIPAA Compliance Officer Kory Thomas). Form-3 (this document) is the updated, comprehensive 2026 NPP (listing Privacy Officer Josh Frazier). Neither form-2 nor form-3 is a patient-initiated records request form.

Critically, **Gastro Florida does not publish a downloadable ROI form**. Medical records requests are handled through a third-party portal (Sharecare/HDS), and no authorization form PDF is available. This document is the closest thing to a records-access reference, as it describes the right to access records in its patient rights section.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This document was found via a "Privacy Policy" footer link on gastrofl.com, with a source URL of `https://gastrofl.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-Updated-for-2026.pdf`. This is a reasonably standard placement — footer privacy links are conventional, and a patient looking for privacy information would likely check there.

However, finding this document does **not** help a patient requesting their records. The dedicated Medical Records page (gastrofl.com/medical-records/) is completely empty — just a heading with no content. The Patient Forms page links to a Sharecare portal for medical records requests, but does not link to this NPP. A patient who finds this NPP gets told they have the right to access records but receives no instructions on how to actually do so beyond "These requests must be in writing."

The URL/filename is descriptive (`Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-Updated-for-2026.pdf`), which is a positive signal.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (18,305 characters across 7 pages). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. This is appropriate since it's an informational notice, not a form requiring patient input (though an acknowledgment signature field could reasonably be interactive).
- **File format/size:** 321 KB for 7 pages of primarily text content with 2 embedded images and 15 fonts. The size is reasonable.
- **Digital-first design:** The document appears to be digitally authored (not a scanned paper document). Text is well-structured with numbered sections and hierarchical headings. However, zero-width spaces (Unicode `\u200B`) appear scattered throughout the text (visible in extracted text as `​` after many headings and terms), suggesting possible copy-paste artifacts from a web-based template or word processor.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality:** At 7 pages, this is a comprehensive NPP covering HIPAA Privacy Rule, 42 CFR Part 2 (substance use disorder protections), patient rights, permitted disclosures, breach notification, and complaint procedures. The length is appropriate for the scope of content.

**Clarity:** The document uses a mix of plain language and legal/regulatory terminology. Some sections are written in accessible, patient-friendly language (e.g., "We can share health information about you for certain situations such as: • Preventing disease • Preventing or reducing a serious threat to anyone's health or safety"). Other sections are dense regulatory prose (e.g., the 42 CFR Part 2 section on redisclosure). The overall reading level is moderate — a motivated patient could work through it, but it is not written at a plain-language standard.

**Organization:** The document follows a logical structure: (1) Commitment to Privacy, (2) Legal Duties, (3) Uses and Disclosures, (4) Patient Rights, (5) Changes to Notice, (6) Complaint Rights, then Acknowledgment. Sections are numbered, which aids navigation. However, within Section 3 alone there are 18 subsections (A through C, then numbered 1-18), which creates a dense middle section that may overwhelm readers.

**Layout:** The document uses bullet points, numbered lists, and bolded headings to create visual hierarchy. Some sections feature summary boxes (e.g., the permitted-uses grid: "Treat you / Run our organization / Bill for your services...") that provide at-a-glance orientation. However, the formatting is inconsistent — some items use `o` as bullet markers, others use `●`, and some use `•`. Section 3C mixes a formatted summary grid with a longer prose enumeration that partially duplicates content from Section 3A.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Records access guidance:** Section 4.3 states: "Right to Get Electronic or Paper Copy of Your Medical Records & to Access Them Directly. We Are Allowed to Charge a Reasonable Fee Based on Our Costs." It further specifies: "These requests must be in writing. You may request copies of your records from your provider. If your records are maintained in an electronic format, you have the right to obtain an electronic copy of your records." This establishes the right but provides **no practical guidance** — no form reference, no portal URL, no mailing address, no fax number, no email address for submissions.

**Fee disclosure:** The document mentions a "reasonable, cost-based fee" may be charged but provides no specifics on amounts.

**Format options:** The document affirms both electronic and paper copies are available, and references the right to request a specific format: "You have the right to ask that we send information to you at an alternative address or by other means... We must agree to your request as long as we can easily provide it in the format you requested."

**Turnaround time:** No turnaround time is mentioned in this document (form-2 mentions "usually within 30 days").

**EHI/bulk export:** No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Electronic exchange disclosure:** Under Section 3.C.15 ("Electronic Exchange"), the document states: "Your information may be shared w/ other providers, labs and radiology groups through our EHR system as listed: None." This is notable because form-2 (the older NPP) listed seven EHR exchange partners (Lab Corp, Quest, Baycare eXchange, etc.). The "None" entry in the updated document may be an error or a template placeholder that was not filled in.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No unreasonable barriers** are imposed in this document itself, as it is not a request form. It does state that records requests "must be in writing," which is a standard and permissible requirement under HIPAA.

**Psychotherapy notes restriction:** The document states "Psychotherapy Notes have special HIPAA protections and are not available to patients," which is consistent with 45 CFR § 164.524(a)(1)(i).

**Breach notification via email:** The document states: "Our Practice May Notify You of a Breach by Email Notification... There are risks that email may not be as private as a sealed first-class letter and therefore you always have the right to opt-out of email or text notifications from our practice." This appropriately discloses the method and provides opt-out.

**Complaint rights:** Clearly states patients can file complaints with the Privacy Officer or HHS, with specific contact information and address. Notes: "We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **"ClientName" placeholder in live document:** The very first substantive sentence reads: "**ClientName** respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your health information." The placeholder "ClientName" was never replaced with "Gastro Florida." This strongly suggests the document is a vendor-provided template that was published without complete customization. A patient reading this would immediately question whether the document applies to them.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No actionable records request instructions:** The document tells patients they have the right to access records and that "These requests must be in writing," but provides no form, portal URL, mailing address, fax number, or email for submitting a request. A patient reading this document would know they have rights but not how to exercise them.

- **Electronic Exchange listed as "None":** The older form-2 NPP listed seven EHR exchange partners. The updated form-3 lists "None." It is unclear whether this is intentional (the practice left all exchange networks), a template default, or an oversight. This creates confusion about whether electronic exchange actually occurs.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **"ClientName" template variable:** As noted above, the unresolved placeholder is a clear production error — the document was published without replacing the template variable.

- **Zero-width space characters:** The extracted text contains numerous Unicode zero-width spaces (`\u200B`) embedded throughout headings and body text (e.g., "NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES​", "Effective Date: 1/1/2026​"). While invisible in rendered PDF, these are artifacts of the authoring tool and could cause issues with text search, copy-paste, or accessibility software.

- **Inconsistent bullet formatting:** The document mixes `o`, `●`, `•`, and `—` as list markers, sometimes within the same section. Section 3.C.18 ("Public Health and Safety") contains what appear to be fragments of a bulleted list that were partially merged into prose (e.g., "• Reporting adverse reactions to medications • Do research • Comply with the law • Respond to organ and tissue donation requests • Work with a medical examiner or funeral director.").

- **Duplicated content between Sections 3A and 3C:** Section 3.C includes a summary grid ("Treat you / Run our organization / Bill for your services") that duplicates the Section 3.A content on Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations, and then Section 3.C.18 re-lists disclosures already covered in earlier subsections. This suggests a template that was assembled from multiple sources without deduplication.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **42 CFR Part 2 coverage:** The document includes substantive discussion of substance use disorder record protections under 42 CFR Part 2, including the CARES Act alignment, one-time consent provisions, and restrictions on use in legal proceedings. This level of detail is uncommon in NPPs and reflects awareness of current regulatory developments.

- **Named Privacy Officer with direct phone number:** The document identifies Privacy Officer Josh Frazier with a direct phone number — (727) 347-0536 — appearing in both the introduction and the complaint section. This gives patients a clear human contact point.
