# Gastro Florida — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Gastro Florida
- **Website:** https://gastrofl.com
- **Location:** Clearwater, FL
- **Type:** Independent physician practice (gastroenterology), for-profit

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web search for authorization/release forms
- Searched: `"Gastro Florida" "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form`
- Searched: `site:gastrofl.com authorization release medical records`
- Searched: `"gastrofl.com" "wp-content/uploads" authorization OR release OR "medical records" PDF`
- Searched: `"Gastro Florida" "medical records release" OR "authorization form" OR "ROI form" download PDF`
- **Result:** No standalone ROI/authorization form PDF found. All sources confirm Gastro Florida uses a third-party online portal (Sharecare/HDS) for medical records requests.

### 2. Website navigation
- **Patient Forms page** (https://gastrofl.com/patient-forms/): Lists several downloadable PDFs (new patient paperwork, HIPAA notice, patient rights, financial policy) plus a link to "Medical Records Request" which redirects to an external Sharecare portal.
- **Medical Records page** (https://gastrofl.com/medical-records/): Completely empty — only has the heading "Medical Records" with no content, instructions, or downloadable forms.

### 3. Sharecare/HDS Portal
- URL: https://submissionportal.hds.sharecare.com/lfserver/PatientRequest?ClientID=FL2000
- Redirects to: https://myplatform.hds.sharecare.com/submission-tools/ui/patient?clientId=FL2000
- This is a fully online, multi-step medical records request submission tool (progress bar shows ~31 steps). It requires identity verification via driver's license/state ID. No downloadable PDF form is available through this portal.

## Key Finding
**Gastro Florida does not publish a downloadable ROI/authorization form.** Medical records requests are handled entirely through a third-party online portal (Sharecare/HDS). The new patient paperwork contains a brief "Authorization to Release Information" clause, but it only authorizes release to third-party payors and providers for care/billing purposes — it is not a patient-initiated records request form.

## Difficulties
- **No downloadable ROI form exists.** Gastro Florida has outsourced their entire medical records request process to a third-party vendor (Sharecare/HDS). There is no PDF authorization form available for download on their website.
- **Medical Records page is empty.** The dedicated medical records page at gastrofl.com/medical-records/ has no content — just a heading with no instructions, links, or forms.
- **Authorization embedded in patient paperwork.** The closest thing to an authorization form is a brief clause in the new patient paperwork (form-1.pdf), but it only covers release to payors/providers, not patient-initiated records requests.
