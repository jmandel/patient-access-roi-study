# Yale New Haven Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Yale New Haven Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately found the official fillable PDF on the parent system (Yale New Haven Health System / YNHHS) website.
2. **Web search** for "site:ynhhs.org request medical records release of information form" — confirmed the main form and discovered a separate form for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital (another YNHHS facility).

The forms were easy to find. The parent system website (ynhhs.org) has a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page with direct links to downloadable PDFs.

## Difficulties

- **None significant.** Both forms were directly linked from the YNHHS "Request Medical Records" page and downloaded without any bot blocking or access issues.
- The forms are hosted on the parent system website (ynhhs.org) rather than the individual hospital site (ynhh.org), which makes sense given YNHH is part of the larger Yale New Haven Health System.

## Key Observations

- Yale New Haven Hospital uses a system-wide authorization form that covers multiple YNHHS facilities
- The form is fillable (interactive PDF fields) and offers electronic delivery via MyChart
- Lawrence + Memorial Hospital has its own separate form, suggesting some facility-level variation within the system
