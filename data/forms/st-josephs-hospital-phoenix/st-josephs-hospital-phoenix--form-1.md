# Evaluation: St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — form-1.pdf

**Organization:** St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ)
**System Affiliation:** Dignity Health / CommonSpirit Health
**Document:** `form-1.pdf` — "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information"
**Source URL:** `https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/arizona/medical-records-release3213448.pdf`

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-1 is a **general-purpose authorization for use or disclosure of PHI**, titled "AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OR DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION." It is a system-level Dignity Health Arizona form (form number `110.1.004 Form General Authorization for Arizona`), not specific to St. Joseph's Hospital. It was found via web search, **not** linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page.

This form is one of three documents found for this organization:
- **form-1.pdf** (this document): General Arizona Dignity Health authorization — found via web search only
- **form-2.pdf**: St. Joseph's-specific "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" form
- **form-3.pdf**: Third-party authorization form — linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page; image-only scan

Form-1 is a **third-party release form**, designed for patients to authorize disclosure of their records to others. It is **not** a patient access form. Notably, page 3 of form-1 is branded for **Mercy Gilbert Medical Center** (a different Dignity Health facility in Gilbert, AZ), including that facility's address, phone number, parking directions, and department hours. This strongly suggests the PDF is a composite document assembled for the Mercy Gilbert facility, not St. Joseph's.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**How the form was found:** The retrieval agent found this form through a general web search for `Dignity Health "authorization" "release of information" medical records form filetype:pdf`. It was **not** linked from the St. Joseph's Hospital medical records page, which instead links to form-2 (patient access) and form-3 (third-party release).

**Findability assessment:** This form is poorly associated with St. Joseph's Hospital. A patient searching the St. Joseph's website would not encounter it. The URL (`medical-records-release3213448.pdf`) lives in the general `/arizona/` path of Dignity Health's content DAM, with no indication it belongs to any specific facility. The filename includes an opaque numeric suffix (`3213448`) that provides no useful information. The only facility specifically referenced in the document is Mercy Gilbert Medical Center, making it confusing for a St. Joseph's patient who stumbles upon it.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (6,493 characters across 3 pages).
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. The form has no interactive form fields despite having 16 fonts and 9 embedded images, indicating it was digitally typeset (not scanned) but designed for print-and-fill workflow.
- **File size:** 83,015 bytes (83 KB) for 3 pages — reasonable.
- **PDF version:** Not specified in metadata but the text layer and font count confirm digital origin.
- **Digital-first design:** No. This is a flat PDF designed to be printed, handwritten on, and physically submitted. There are no fillable fields, no electronic submission instructions (beyond the Mercy Gilbert page mentioning mail), and no digital signature capabilities.

The form is technically accessible for reading (good text layer, searchable) but not for completing — a patient must print it and fill it out by hand.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 3 pages. Pages 1-2 contain the authorization form proper (which self-labels as "Page 1 of 2" and "Page 2 of 2"). Page 3 is an instruction sheet branded for Mercy Gilbert Medical Center.

**Page numbering inconsistency:** The form uses dual pagination — the authorization form itself says "Page 1 of 2" / "Page 2 of 2" while the PDF footer says "CN MG AUTH PHI Page 1 of 3" / "Page 2 of 3" / "Page 3 of 3". The "MG" in the footer likely stands for Mercy Gilbert, confirming this is a Mercy Gilbert-specific compilation.

**Organization of content:**
- Page 1: Patient identification fields, authorization direction ("I AUTHORIZE... TO DISCLOSE TO..."), record type checkboxes (ER, labs, billing, etc.), sensitive information categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV, genetic testing)
- Page 2: Purpose statement, expiration clause, patient rights section, signature block, 42 C.F.R. Part 2 re-disclosure notice
- Page 3: Mercy Gilbert-specific patient instructions for requesting records

**Clarity:** The form uses a mix of plain and legal language. The core authorization section is reasonably clear — "I AUTHORIZE... TO DISCLOSE TO..." is straightforward. However, some passages are dense legal text, particularly the 42 C.F.R. Part 2 re-disclosure prohibition notice. The opening warning — "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — is somewhat intimidating.

**Record type options:** The form offers 10 specific record type checkboxes (Emergency Room, Procedure Reports, Billing Records, History and Physical, Progress Notes, Consultation Records, Laboratory Tests, X-Ray Reports, Discharge Summary) plus Date(s) and Other(s) fields, and an "ALL RECORDS" option. This is a reasonable selection.

**Layout:** The form is moderately dense. Fields are lined up with adequate spacing. The sensitive-information section (mental health, substance abuse, HIV, genetic testing) is presented as a list with initialing lines, which is appropriate given the special legal protections. Font sizes appear adequate (likely 10-11pt for body text).

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is explicitly a **third-party release form**. It uses the structure "I AUTHORIZE [facility] TO DISCLOSE TO [recipient]" — designed for sending records to another party, not for the patient requesting their own records. St. Joseph's has a separate dedicated patient access form (form-2.pdf) that is specifically titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and is linked from their medical records page.

**Scope options:** Patients can specify record types via checkboxes and provide date ranges. The "ALL RECORDS" option is available. Sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV, genetic testing) require separate initialing, which is legally appropriate.

**Format/delivery options:** None specified on the authorization form itself. The Mercy Gilbert instruction sheet (page 3) mentions walk-in pickup, mail, or having someone else pick up with a photocopy of the patient's photo ID. No electronic delivery options are mentioned.

**Right of Access language:** The form mentions the right to refuse signing ("My refusal will not affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment or eligibility for benefits") and the right to revoke. It references HIPAA indirectly through the re-disclosure language. However, it does not cite 45 CFR § 164.524 or frame the form in terms of the patient's right of access — because it is not a right-of-access form.

**EHI Export awareness:** None.

**Mercy Gilbert instruction page:** Page 3 provides surprisingly helpful patient instructions for Mercy Gilbert — explaining how to request records (inpatient, walk-in, or proxy), expected turnaround time (5 business days), department location with parking directions, hours (8am-5pm M-F), and phone numbers. However, these instructions are specific to Mercy Gilbert Medical Center, not St. Joseph's Hospital, making them misleading if this form were used at St. Joseph's.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** "This authorization will automatically expire one (1) year from the date of execution unless a different event or end date is specified." One year is a standard and reasonable expiration period.

**Revocation:** The form states patients may revoke "at any time" in writing, which is appropriate. However, the revocation addresses are for Chandler and Gilbert facilities: "Medical Records 475 S. Dobson Rd., Chandler, AZ 85224 or Medical Records 3555 S. Val Vista Drive, Gilbert, AZ 85297." Neither address is St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix.

**Re-disclosure warning:** The form includes appropriate re-disclosure language for both general PHI and 42 C.F.R. Part 2 substance abuse records.

**"Failure to provide all information" warning:** The form opens with "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization." While technically a reasonable statement, it could discourage patients from submitting partially completed forms, even when the missing information is nonessential.

**Fees:** No fee information is provided on the authorization form itself.

**Submission methods:** The Mercy Gilbert instruction page mentions in-person pickup, mail, and proxy pickup. No electronic submission options are described for the form itself.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Wrong-facility revocation addresses:** The form directs patients to send revocations to addresses in Chandler and Gilbert, AZ — neither of which is St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. A St. Joseph's patient following these instructions would be sending correspondence to the wrong facility.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Facility mismatch throughout:** Page 3 is entirely branded for "Mercy Gilbert Medical Center" with that facility's address, phone number, hours, and parking directions — despite this form being catalogued as a St. Joseph's Hospital document. It is unclear whether this PDF was ever intended for use at St. Joseph's or was misidentified during web retrieval.
- **Dual pagination:** The form labels itself "Page 1 of 2" / "Page 2 of 2" within the authorization, but the footer reads "Page 1 of 3" / "Page 2 of 3" / "Page 3 of 3," creating confusion about whether the Mercy Gilbert instruction sheet is part of the official authorization.
- **"Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization"** — vague about which fields are truly required versus optional.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Outdated form:** The revision dates are `02/01/04, 5/18/11, 2/15/12` — the most recent revision is from **February 2012**, making this form over 13 years old. Regulations, facility names, addresses, and procedures may have changed significantly.
- **Dead URL reference:** Page 3 directs patients to `www.mercygilbert.org/medical_services` to find the form online — this URL is almost certainly defunct given Dignity Health's rebranding and website consolidation.
- **Inconsistent date formatting:** Revision dates use two different formats (`02/01/04` vs. `5/18/11` vs. `2/15/12`), mixing zero-padded and non-padded month formats.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular record type selection:** The form offers 10 specific record categories plus a date range field and an "ALL RECORDS" option, giving patients meaningful control over disclosure scope.
- **Sensitive-information protections:** The form appropriately separates mental health, substance abuse, HIV, and genetic testing information with individual initialing requirements, reflecting awareness of special legal protections under state and federal law.
