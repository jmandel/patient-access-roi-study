## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **patient access request form** — specifically titled "PATIENT'S REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION." It is distinct from the two other forms found for this organization: form-1.pdf is a general Arizona Dignity Health third-party authorization form (found via web search, not linked from St. Joseph's page), and form-3.pdf is a third-party release authorization (image-only scan, form X-MR-4862). This form-2 is the primary patient-facing document linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page under the "request for yourself" category.

The form covers multiple Dignity Health Arizona facilities beyond St. Joseph's itself, listing St. Joseph's Hospital Westgate, Dignity Health Cancer Institute, Barrow Neurological Institute, Center for Transitional NeuroRehab (CTN), Norton Thoracic Institute, Transplant Center, and Dignity Health Medical Group. It functions as a shared patient access form across the Arizona Dignity Health network.

Page 5 of the document is a "CAREGIVER DENIAL OF ACCESS FORM" marked "(Facility use only)" — an internal workflow page appended to the patient-facing form.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, the form was found by navigating the St. Joseph's medical records page at `dignityhealth.org/arizona/locations/stjosephs/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/medical-records`, which was approximately 4–5 clicks deep from the main Dignity Health site. The medical records page reportedly distinguishes between patient self-request and third-party authorization, linking to this form for the former.

The source URL (`ROI-SJHMC-PATIENTREQUEST(ENGLISH)%20(1).pdf`) is reasonably descriptive — it identifies the facility (SJHMC), purpose (PATIENT REQUEST), and language (ENGLISH), though the `%20(1)` suffix suggests a versioning artifact. The form is also available via email submission to `DignityHealth-AZ-ROI@DignityHealth.org`, which the form itself lists on page 1 — a helpful detail for patients who find the form itself.

Overall findability is moderate: the form exists on the website and is linked from a logical location, but reaching the medical records page requires navigating several levels of the Dignity Health site hierarchy.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present. The full text extracts cleanly at 6,654 characters across 5 pages, with no garbled or missing content.

**Fillable fields**: Zero (0). Despite having 11 fonts and structured checkbox/field layout, the PDF contains no interactive form fields. Patients must print and fill by hand, or annotate the PDF with a separate tool. This is a significant gap for a form that appears to have been digitally typeset (not scanned).

**File format**: 144,221 bytes (144 KB) for 5 pages with 5 embedded images. The file size is reasonable. The document is not an image-only scan — it was created digitally with proper text encoding.

**Digital-first design**: Mixed. The form was clearly composed digitally (clean text, consistent fonts, structured layout), but was designed as a print-and-fill document. The blank lines for handwritten input (e.g., "Date:", "Patient Name:", "Address:") and checkbox squares that are not interactive confirm it was built for paper workflow, not electronic completion. The inclusion of email and fax submission options on page 1 shows awareness of remote submission, but the form itself doesn't support electronic filling.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 5 pages. Pages 1–4 are patient-facing content; page 5 is a facility-only denial form. Four patient-facing pages is moderately long for a patient access request but is justified by the breadth of options offered (delivery format, record types, sensitive records, multi-facility routing).

**Organization**: The form uses lettered sections (A through E) with clear headings:
- **A**: How to access (inspect, copy, or both)
- **B**: Delivery format (electronic vs. paper)
- **C**: Record types to access (14 specific categories plus complete record and "pertinent/abstract")
- **D**: Patient portal access
- **E**: Directing records to another person

This logical progression from "how" to "what" to "where" is well-structured.

**Clarity**: The language is mostly clear but includes some institutional jargon. The opening text — "You have requested access to health information about you. To enable us to process your request, please read the following carefully and complete the requested information below." — is reasonable. However, phrases like "Pertinent/Abstract" in Section C are unexplained clinical terms that patients may not understand. The note about unsecured email is clear: "I understand that using unsecured email may place my PHI at risk and accept the risk of sending my PHI via an unsecured mechanism."

**Layout issues**: Page 1 is dense. It combines patient demographic fields, facility selection (8+ facilities), and routing information (multiple email addresses and fax numbers for different departments) all on a single page. The routing section listing separate email/fax contacts for ROI, DHMG, Radiology/Imaging, Billing (clinics), Billing (hospital), and Barrow Brain & Spine is complex and likely confusing for patients — they must determine which department handles their request.

**Fee disclosure**: The form states "There may be fees associated with your request" and references "See attached price list" for copy requests. No actual price list is included in the PDF.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access focus**: This form is explicitly designed for patient access to their own records, which is a strong positive. The title and content make clear this is not a third-party release — a separate form (form-3.pdf) exists for that purpose.

**Scope options**: Excellent granularity. Section C offers 14 specific record types (Billing, Clinical, Consultation Reports, Diagnostic Images, Discharge Summary, ER Records, H&P, Immunization, Lab Tests, Medication List, Operations/Procedures, PT Notes, Progress Notes) plus "Complete Health Record" and a "Pertinent/Abstract" bundle. Date range filtering is available on page 1 ("Covering the period of healthcare from ___ to ___").

**Format/delivery options**: The form offers multiple delivery formats (Section B): USB drive, CD, secure email, unsecured email, and paper. This is notably comprehensive — many forms offer only paper or fax. The inclusion of USB and CD options, while somewhat dated, shows awareness of electronic delivery. Secure email is the most practical electronic option.

**Patient portal**: Section D provides a separate pathway for online patient portal access, requiring only an email address. This acknowledges the portal as an alternative channel.

**Right to direct**: Section E explicitly references "Patient's Right to Direct Health Information to another person," noting "You have the right to ask us to send your health information to a person of your choice." This aligns with HIPAA's right to direct access.

**Sensitive records**: The form addresses sensitive record categories with state-specific rules for Arizona, California, and Nevada Dignity Health facilities, covering mental health, substance abuse, HIV, genetic testing, and (in California) developmental disability records. Each category requires a separate initial.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or USCDI.

**HIPAA reference**: The form does not explicitly cite 45 CFR § 164.524 or use the phrase "Right of Access," though its title ("Patient's Request for Access") and content clearly implement this right.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Submission options**: The form provides email and fax submission options printed on page 1, which is a positive — no in-person submission is required. However, the form includes a line for "ID Presented" and "Name of hospital employee verifying signatory information" on page 4, suggesting that in-person verification may be expected or preferred in practice.

**Fees**: The form states fees "may" apply for copies and references an attached price list that is not included in the PDF. Patients cannot assess costs before submitting. The fee language is appropriately conditional ("Fees may apply") rather than asserting mandatory charges.

**Authorization expiration**: No expiration clause is stated for the patient access request. This contrasts with form-1.pdf (the third-party authorization), which auto-expires after one year.

**Denial provisions**: Page 5 includes a structured denial form with checkboxes for "Denied in whole" and "Denied in part," with a detailed note listing the permissible HIPAA grounds for denial (danger to life/safety, confidential source protection, harm to third parties, harm from personal representative access). This is a compliance-positive feature — it shows the organization has a structured process for denials rather than ad hoc refusals.

**Processing order**: The form states "All patients' (or personal representative's) request(s) for access to their health information are processed in the order received" and that "we will contact you with either denial or acceptance of the request." This is somewhat unusual — HIPAA does not require "acceptance" of a patient access request; it requires fulfillment within 30 days. The language implying the hospital may choose to "accept" or not introduces ambiguity.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **"Acceptance" language**: The form states the hospital will "contact you with either denial or acceptance of the request." Under HIPAA § 164.524, patient access requests must be fulfilled within 30 days (with one 30-day extension); the default is fulfillment, not a discretionary "acceptance." Framing the response as acceptance-or-denial suggests a gatekeeping posture inconsistent with the right of access.

- **Employee verification line**: Page 4 includes fields for "ID Presented" and "Name of hospital employee verifying signatory information" with "Title and Department." While identity verification is reasonable, the structured employee-verification block implies in-person presentation may be expected, which could deter patients who submit remotely via email or fax.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Routing complexity**: Page 1 lists six different email addresses and three fax numbers for different departments (general ROI, DHMG, Radiology/Imaging, Billing-clinics, Billing-hospital, Barrow Brain & Spine). Patients must determine which department to contact — a task that presupposes institutional knowledge most patients lack. No guidance is provided on how to choose.

- **Fee schedule reference without inclusion**: The form states "Fees may apply. See attached price list" but no price list is included in the downloaded PDF. Patients cannot evaluate costs before submitting.

- **Multi-state sensitive records section**: The form includes separate sensitive-records consent blocks for Arizona, California, and Nevada Dignity Health facilities. For a form linked from the St. Joseph's Phoenix (Arizona) medical records page, the California and Nevada sections add confusion — patients may wonder whether they need to initial those sections or whether the form applies across states.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated patient access form**: Unlike many organizations that use a single general authorization form for both patient access and third-party release, St. Joseph's provides a distinct "Patient's Request for Access" form. This avoids the common confusion of patients signing third-party release language when they simply want their own records.

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: Offering USB, CD, secure email, and unsecured email alongside paper is unusually comprehensive. The secure email option in particular provides a practical electronic delivery mechanism.

- **Email/fax submission**: The form prominently lists email addresses and fax numbers for submission on page 1, enabling remote filing without requiring in-person visits.

- **Structured denial process**: Including a formal denial form (page 5) with specific HIPAA-aligned grounds for denial demonstrates institutional accountability and gives patients a documented basis for any access restriction.

- **Granular record type selection**: The 14+ specific record categories in Section C give patients meaningful control over what they receive, rather than forcing an all-or-nothing request.
