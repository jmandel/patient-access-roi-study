# St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center
- **Location**: Phoenix, AZ
- **Website**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/arizona/locations/stjosephs
- **System**: Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health)

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center Phoenix "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no direct PDF results.
2. **Web search** for `Dignity Health "authorization" "release of information" medical records form filetype:pdf` — found the Arizona-specific general authorization form at `dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/arizona/medical-records-release3213448.pdf`.
3. **Web search** for `site:dignityhealth.org authorization release medical records` — found references to the St. Joseph's medical records page.
4. **Navigated** directly to the St. Joseph's medical records page: `https://www.dignityhealth.org/arizona/locations/stjosephs/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/medical-records` — this page links to two form types: a patient request form and a third-party authorization form (each in English and Spanish).

The **St. Joseph's medical records page** was the most productive source, providing links to the specific forms used at this facility.

Includes checkboxes for types of records (ER, labs, billing, etc.), mental health, substance abuse, HIV, and genetic testing. Mentions revocation address in Chandler/Gilbert, AZ — may be a shared form across multiple Arizona facilities rather than St. Joseph's specifically. Found via web search, not linked from the St. Joseph's page.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/arizona/pdfs/ROI-SJHMC-PATIENTREQUEST(ENGLISH)%20(1).pdf
- **Document type**: St. Joseph's specific "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" (patient access form)
- **Pages**: 5
- **File size**: 144,221 bytes
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Notes**: This is the primary patient access form for St. Joseph's. It is specifically branded for SJHMC and lists multiple Dignity Health Arizona facilities (St. Joseph's, Westgate, Barrow Neurological Institute, Norton Thoracic Institute, etc.). Offers electronic delivery options (USB, CD, secure/unsecured email) and paper. Includes a fee schedule reference. Form number X-MR-4869, dated 02/22. Linked directly from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/arizona/third-party-english3213448.pdf
- **Document type**: "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (third-party release form)
- **Pages**: 2
- **File size**: 335,505 bytes
- **Has text layer**: Minimal (title only); effectively an image-only scanned form
- **Notes**: This is the third-party authorization form linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page. It is a scanned image PDF (CCITT-encoded images at 1200 DPI). Very little extractable text — only the title. Form number X-MR-4862, dated 03/13. Used when patients want records sent to a physician or other third party.

## Difficulties
- The third-party authorization form (form-3.pdf) is an image-only scan with virtually no text layer, making it inaccessible for text extraction or digital form-filling.
- The general Arizona authorization (form-1.pdf) found via web search appears to be a different/older form than what's linked from the St. Joseph's page — it references addresses in Chandler and Gilbert rather than St. Joseph's in Phoenix.
- The medical records page was easy to find: Home → Arizona → St. Joseph's → Patients and Visitors → For Patients → Medical Records (about 4-5 clicks from the main site).

## Summary
St. Joseph's Hospital provides two distinct forms for medical records: a **patient access request form** (form-2.pdf) for patients requesting their own records, and a **third-party authorization form** (form-3.pdf) for releasing records to others. The patient access form is notably comprehensive (5 pages) with electronic delivery options, while the third-party form is a basic scanned 2-page form. A general Arizona Dignity Health authorization form (form-1.pdf) was also found via web search.
