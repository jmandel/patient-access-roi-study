## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is the **general third-party authorization form** for releasing protected health information from Advocate Health facilities, including Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital. It is a system-wide form used across both Illinois and Wisconsin (as indicated by the filename suffix "wi-il"). The form's title — "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — and its structure (requiring a named recipient under "Release the Requested Information to") make clear it is designed for disclosing PHI to third parties, not specifically for a patient requesting their own records.

Advocate Health provides a separate companion form for patient self-requests: **form-4.pdf** ("Patient Request for Health Information," form code S88411), which includes a "Myself" checkbox option, a callout to the LiveWell patient portal, and omits the third-party authorization language. The two forms share a nearly identical structure for selecting record types and delivery methods but serve different purposes: form-4 is patient-access-specific, while form-5 is the standard ROI authorization for disclosures to others.

Other forms found for this organization include: an older Advocate Medical Group (AMG) version of a release form (form-2), two Employee Assistance Program forms (form-1, form-3), a Spanish-language version of a related authorization (form-6, form code S23623-SP, 3 pages), and an instructions document (form-7). The Spanish version (form-6) appears to correspond to an older version of the authorization form rather than being a direct translation of form-5, since its form code (S23623) differs from form-5's (S300503) and it uses a different layout with numbered sections.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form is linked directly from Advocate Health's centralized medical records page at https://www.advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records, which is reachable from the site's "Contact Us" navigation. The retrieval notes confirm this page "clearly lists two primary forms (Patient Request form and Authorization to Release form) with PDF download links." Web searches for "Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" also surfaced direct PDF URLs.

The URL itself is descriptive: the filename `authorization-to-release-protected-health-information-wi-il-s300503.PDF` clearly identifies the document's purpose. The medical records page provides both the patient request form and this authorization form side by side, which is helpful — though it does place a burden on patients to distinguish which form they need (a point addressed further under Patient-Centeredness).

Overall, findability is good. The form is accessible in 2-3 clicks from the main Advocate Health site, surfaced by standard web searches, and hosted at a stable, descriptive URL.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present. The full text (3,423 characters) is extractable, confirming this is a digitally composed document rather than a scan.

**Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite having clear labeled fields (Patient Name, Date of Birth, Street Address, City/State/Zip, Telephone, Email, Treatment Facility/Physician, Treatment Dates, plus numerous checkboxes for record types, delivery method, and purpose), none are implemented as interactive PDF form fields. Patients must print, hand-fill, and submit physically — or annotate the PDF with a third-party tool.

**Font count:** 9 fonts are embedded, consistent with a professionally designed document with some typographic variety (likely bold/regular variants plus a different face for headings).

**Embedded images:** 1, likely a logo.

**File size:** 196 KB for a single page is moderately large but not unreasonable given embedded fonts and a logo image.

**Design origin:** This appears to be a digitally authored PDF (not a scan), recently revised (Rev. 11/25 — November 2025). However, the absence of fillable fields means it functions as a print-oriented form despite its digital origin.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and density:** The entire form fits on a single page, which is commendable for a form covering medical records, imaging, billing, delivery method, purpose, rights language, and signature blocks. However, this compression comes at a cost — the form is quite dense. The text extracted runs to 3,423 characters with minimal white space implied by the layout.

**Organization:** The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → treatment facility/dates → behavioral health mutual exchange checkbox → record type selection (Medical Records / Imaging / Billing) → recipient information → purpose of release → delivery method → rights statement → expiration → signature. This is a sensible ordering.

**Record type granularity:** The form offers detailed checkboxes under three categories:
- **Medical Records:** Facility Summary, Discharge Summary, History & Physical, Consultation Reports, Emergency Record, Operative Reports, Laboratory Reports, Pathology Reports, Radiology Reports, Immunizations, Sleep Study Reports, Entire Medical Record, Office/Progress Notes, Behavioral Health Treatment Records, plus an "Other" option.
- **Imaging:** Radiology Images, Cardiology Images, Neurology Images, Fetal Ultrasound Images, Other Imaging.
- **Billing:** Itemized Bill(s), UB04 Form, CMS 1500 Form, Other Billing.

This granularity is a strength — patients can request exactly what they need.

**Delivery method options:** The form lists multiple options:
- By Mail: Paper Copy, CD
- Electronically: Encrypted Email, Patient Portal
- Other: In Person Pick-up (Paper or CD)

The inclusion of encrypted email and patient portal as delivery options is notable and modern.

**Language clarity:** The rights section uses formal but reasonably clear language: "I may revoke this authorization at any time by providing written notice to the health information department." The re-disclosure warning is stated plainly: "information disclosed under this authorization may be subject to re-disclosure and may no longer be protected by federal and state privacy laws." However, the form is primarily written in legal/healthcare language and does not include plain-language summaries or explanations.

**Readability concern:** The single-page compression means font sizes are likely small. With 3,423 characters of text, detailed checkbox groups, multiple signature blocks, and rights language all on one page, readability may be challenging for some patients.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This form is designed for **third-party disclosures**, not patient self-access. The "Release the Requested Information to" section requires a named recipient with address, phone, and fax — there is no "Myself" checkbox as found on the companion form-4. A patient wanting their own records would need to use form-4 instead. The medical records webpage does differentiate the two forms, but the form itself does not direct patients to the correct form if they are requesting their own records.

**Purpose options:** The form offers four purpose checkboxes: "Continuation of Care," "Personal (at my request)," "Legal/Investigation," and "Insurance," plus an "Other" field. The "Personal (at my request)" option is available but this form's structure still routes records to a named third-party recipient.

**Format/delivery options:** Strong. The form offers paper mail, CD, encrypted email, patient portal, and in-person pick-up. The "(Fees may apply)" note is honest but vague — it does not specify fee amounts.

**Right of Access language:** The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The rights section focuses on revocation rights, non-conditioning of treatment on signing, and re-disclosure risks — all standard authorization elements. There is no mention of EHI (Electronic Health Information) export, bulk data, or the 21st Century Cures Act.

**Sensitive information handling:** The form states: "This is a full release, including information related to behavioral/mental health, drug and alcohol abuse treatment (in compliance with 42 CFR Part 2), genetic information, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases." This is an opt-in-everything approach — there are no checkboxes to exclude sensitive categories (unlike the Spanish-language form-6/S23623, which allows patients to check categories to exclude). This is a significant difference from the companion forms.

**Minor authorization:** Includes a thoughtful section on minors' right to sign for certain treatment types (pregnancy, STDs, outpatient behavioral health, substance use), which reflects Illinois law requirements.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** "This authorization expires one year from the date of my signature unless otherwise written here." One year is a standard and reasonable expiration period.

**Fees:** The form notes "(Fees may apply)" next to the delivery method section but does not disclose specific amounts. This is somewhat concerning — HIPAA limits fees for patient access to reasonable cost-based fees, and patients should ideally know costs upfront.

**No notarization requirement:** The form does not require notarization.

**No in-person-only restriction:** The form offers mail, fax, and electronic submission pathways (implicitly, as it lists a mailing destination and fax in the instructions form-7).

**Witness requirement:** Not required on this form (unlike some Illinois mental health-specific requirements addressed in the Spanish form-6).

**42 CFR Part 2 compliance:** The form explicitly references 42 CFR Part 2 for substance abuse treatment records, showing awareness of federal substance use privacy protections.

**Full release default:** The statement "This is a full release, including information related to behavioral/mental health, drug and alcohol abuse treatment... genetic information, HIV/AIDS" means that signing this form releases all sensitive categories by default. Unlike the older AMG form (form-2), which lets patients opt out of specific sensitive categories, and unlike the Spanish version (form-6/S23623), which lets patients exclude sensitive categories, form-5 does not offer granular control over sensitive information types.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Full release of sensitive information with no opt-out mechanism.** The form states: "This is a full release, including information related to behavioral/mental health, drug and alcohol abuse treatment (in compliance with 42 CFR Part 2), genetic information, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases." Unlike the older AMG form (form-2) and the Spanish-language form (form-6), which both provide checkboxes to exclude sensitive categories, form-5 offers no way for patients to exclude specific sensitive information types. Under 42 CFR Part 2, consent for substance use disorder records must be genuinely voluntary and specific; a blanket "full release" default may raise compliance concerns.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Relationship to form-4 is unclear on the form itself.** A patient who lands on this form wanting their own records has no guidance that a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-4) exists and would be more appropriate. The two forms look structurally similar, which increases the risk of a patient using the wrong one.
- **"(Fees may apply)" without any specifics.** The form does not explain what fees might be charged, the basis for them, or how to obtain a fee schedule. Patients cannot make an informed decision about delivery method without this information.
- **Spanish form mismatch.** The Spanish-language form (form-6, code S23623-SP) uses a different form code and different structure (numbered sections, 3 pages, opt-out checkboxes for sensitive info) than this English form (S300503, 1 page, no opt-out). Spanish-speaking patients would encounter a materially different form experience, not just a translation.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Multiple modern delivery options.** The form explicitly offers encrypted email and patient portal delivery alongside traditional paper and CD options — this is ahead of many healthcare organizations.
- **Recently revised.** The form code shows "Rev. 11/25" (November 2025), indicating active maintenance and currency.
- **Comprehensive record type granularity.** The detailed checkbox system spanning medical records, imaging (with specific modality breakdowns), and billing gives patients fine-grained control over what is disclosed.
- **Thoughtful minor authorization language.** The form includes specific provisions for when minors may sign independently, reflecting state law requirements for pregnancy, STDs, behavioral health, and substance use treatment.
- **Companion instructions document.** Form-7 provides step-by-step instructions for completing the authorization, which is a helpful patient resource not commonly seen.
