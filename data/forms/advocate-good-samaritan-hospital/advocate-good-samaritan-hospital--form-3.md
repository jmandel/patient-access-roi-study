# Evaluation: Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3 is an **Employee Assistance Program (EAP) "General Release of Information"** form, specifically for supervisory or administrative referrals. It is branded "Advocate Aurora Employee Assistance Program" and is **not a hospital medical records ROI form**. The title block lists three programs: "Employee Assistance Program (EAP)," "Student and Family Assistance Program (SFAP)," and "University Student Assistance Program (USAP)."

This is one of seven forms downloaded for Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, which operates under the Advocate Health system. The retrieval notes identify form-4.pdf as the primary patient access form and form-5.pdf as the primary third-party authorization form. Form-3 is an updated version of form-1 (an older Aurora EAP release) with Advocate Aurora co-branding. Neither form-1 nor form-3 are intended for patients requesting their own hospital medical records — they serve an entirely different organizational function (workplace EAP referrals).

The source URL (`advocatehealth.org/.../employer-solutions/290-release-of-information-for-supervisory-or-administrative-referrals.PDF`) confirms this is an employer-solutions document, not a patient-facing medical records form.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was retrieved via web search rather than from the hospital's medical records page. The notes indicate it was surfaced by broad searches for "authorization release health information" on advocatehealth.com. It is **not linked from the patient-facing medical records page** at advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records, which appropriately features only form-4 and form-5 (plus the Spanish version and instructions). A patient searching for their medical records release form would not encounter this EAP form unless they performed a broad web search.

The URL path (`/employer-solutions/`) and filename (`290-release-of-information-for-supervisory-or-administrative-referrals.PDF`) are descriptive and clearly indicate this is not a patient medical records form — which is helpful for anyone who encounters it via search.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Format**: 1-page PDF, 184,352 bytes (180 KB). Reasonable size for a single-page form.
- **Text layer**: Present; full text is extractable (3,156 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: 27 interactive form fields — notably more than any other form in the Advocate Good Samaritan set (forms 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 all have zero fillable fields). This makes form-3 the most digitally functional document in the collection.
- **Fonts**: 7 fonts embedded.
- **Images**: 2 embedded images (likely logos).
- **Digital-first design**: The presence of 27 fillable fields and pre-checked checkboxes indicates this was designed for on-screen completion, not as a print-and-handwrite form.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The form is a single page and reasonably organized. It flows from client identification at the top through authorization details to signature at the bottom. Key sections include:

- **Client identification**: Name, DOB, Address fields (with labeled blanks)
- **Recipient**: Single field for name/address/program
- **Purpose checkboxes**: Attendance Reporting, Coordination of Care, Compliance Reporting, Personal, Other
- **Information to be disclosed**: Dates of appointments, Recommendations/progress, Clinical Notes, Other
- **Date range**: From/To fields with default of "past two years" if blank
- **Expiration**: Defaults to one year from signing
- **Rights section**: Covers right to inspect, fees, revocation, re-disclosure
- **Signature block**: Client or legal representative, with legal representative options

Several checkboxes arrive **pre-checked** (☒): "Attendance Reporting," "Compliance Reporting," "Dates of scheduled, attended, cancelled and/or missed appointments," "Recommendations, progress and/or follow through," and the reciprocal authorization checkbox. This pre-selection is notable — it reflects the administrative/supervisory referral use case where the employer needs attendance and compliance data by default.

The rights section is written in dense but standard legal language. The form footer reads "Form 290 - Release of Information 1/3/2022," providing a clear revision date.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This form is **not designed for patients requesting their own hospital medical records**. It serves a specific EAP use case: authorizing the Employee Assistance Program to share mental health/substance abuse treatment information with supervisors or referral sources. Key indicators:

- The form refers to "Client" rather than "Patient"
- It authorizes release "to" a named recipient, not "to myself"
- The information categories are EAP-specific (attendance, compliance, recommendations)
- It explicitly states the information "may contain mental health, developmental disability and/or drug and alcohol abuse treatment information"
- There is no mention of hospital medical records, imaging, billing, or electronic delivery options
- No reference to HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524), patient portals, or EHI export
- No electronic delivery options (email, portal, etc.)

A patient who mistakenly used this form to request their hospital medical records would be redirected — it would not accomplish their goal.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

The form includes standard authorization elements:

- **Right to revoke**: "I may revoke this Authorization by notifying the Advocate Aurora EAP in writing"
- **No conditioning of treatment**: "I do not need to sign this Authorization in order to receive treatment"
- **Re-disclosure warning**: "information... may be subject to re-disclosure and no longer protected by federal privacy law"
- **Right to inspect**: "I have the right to inspect and receive a copy of the health information"
- **Fee disclosure**: "I may be charged a fee for record copies"
- **Expiration**: One year default, with option to specify a different date/event
- **IL-specific witness line**: "IL Only- Witness signature for mental health/developmental disabilities records only"

The pre-checked checkboxes for attendance/compliance reporting and the pre-checked reciprocal authorization checkbox are potentially concerning from a consent perspective — they default to sharing rather than requiring affirmative selection. However, this is contextually appropriate for an administrative referral form where these are the expected data flows.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Pre-checked reciprocal authorization**: The reciprocal exchange checkbox ("☒ Check here if authorization is reciprocal") arrives pre-selected, meaning the default is bidirectional information sharing between EAP and the named recipient. A client who does not carefully review the form may unknowingly authorize two-way information exchange. For a form involving sensitive mental health and substance abuse data, this default is aggressive.
- **Pre-checked disclosure categories**: Multiple disclosure items arrive pre-checked (attendance, compliance, recommendations/progress), creating a default-to-share posture. The client would need to actively uncheck boxes to limit disclosure rather than affirmatively opting in.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Relationship to hospital forms unclear**: A patient or employee encountering this form via web search could confuse it with the hospital's medical records release form. The form title "General Release of Information" is generic enough to mislead, despite the EAP header.
- **"Copy to Client" notation**: The footer says "COPY TO CLIENT" but there's no indication of how a copy reaches the client when the form is filled digitally — this language appears carried over from a paper-form workflow.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **27 fillable fields**: This is the only form in the Advocate Good Samaritan collection with interactive form fields, making it significantly more usable for digital completion than the patient-facing forms (form-4, form-5), which have zero fillable fields.
- **Clear revision date**: "Form 290 - Release of Information 1/3/2022" provides unambiguous version tracking.
- **Contact information prominent**: Phone (800.236.3231), fax (414.760.5418), and email (eap@aah.org) are clearly displayed at the top of the form.
