# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — Form 6 Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-6.pdf is the **Spanish-language version** of the Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information, titled "Autorización para revelar información médica protegida." It is identified as form **S23623-SP (Rev. 06/24)** — a system-wide Advocate Health form, not specific to Good Samaritan Hospital.

This form sits in a suite of seven downloaded documents. The two primary English forms are form-4 ("Patient Request for Health Information," S88411-EN, Rev. 11/25) for patient self-access and form-5 ("Authorization to Release Protected Health Information," S300503, Rev. 11/25) for third-party disclosure. Form-6 is the Spanish counterpart to the third-party disclosure form (form-5), and form-7 is an English-language instructions sheet.

Notably, form-6 carries a **different form number** (S23623-SP) than its English counterpart (S300503) and was revised **5 months earlier** (06/24 vs. 11/25). This suggests it is not a direct translation of the current English form but rather a translation of an older English version that has since been superseded and renumbered.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found on the Advocate Health medical records page (advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records), which links directly to downloadable PDFs including the Spanish version. The URL path includes the form ID and "-sp" suffix, making it identifiable as the Spanish form: `authorization-for-disclosure-of-health-information-s23623-sp.PDF`.

The medical records page was reachable through straightforward site navigation. However, it is unclear whether the page labels the Spanish form distinctly or whether a Spanish-speaking user would need to identify it among English-labeled links. There is no indication of a full Spanish-language landing page or navigation path.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full extractable text in Spanish with English parentheticals. Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. This is a flat PDF with no interactive form fields, meaning patients must print and hand-fill or use a PDF annotation tool.
- **File size**: 354,431 bytes for 3 pages — relatively large for a text-based document with no embedded images (0 embedded images reported). The 14 fonts contribute to the file size.
- **Page count**: 3 pages (compared to 1 page for the English form-5 and 1 page for the separate English instructions form-7). Page 3 of form-6 integrates the instructions that are a separate document in English.
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is designed as a print-and-fill form. The lack of fillable fields means it cannot be completed digitally without third-party tools.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure**: The form is organized into 12 numbered sections across 3 pages:
1. Patient Information
2. Authorizes (disclosing entity)
3. Disclose To (recipient/delivery options)
4. Reciprocal authorization checkbox
5. Date range of information
6. Information to be disclosed (record types)
7. Sensitive information exclusion options
8. Expiration
9. Purpose
10. Patient rights
11. Signature
12. Illinois witness for mental health records

**Bilingual approach**: Every field label and instruction is given in Spanish followed by English in parentheses, e.g., "Nombre del proveedor de atención médica/plan/otro" and "Fecha de nacimiento (Date of Birth)." This dual-language approach is thorough but adds significant visual density to the form.

**Length**: At 3 pages, the form is longer than the 1-page English counterpart (form-5), partly because the bilingual labeling doubles the text volume and partly because it integrates instructions (page 3) that are a separate document in English. The instructions page is helpful but further lengthens the document.

**Clarity**: The Spanish is generally clear and uses appropriate medical terminology. The rights section (§10) is necessarily dense legal language but is reasonably translated. Section 6 (record types) has a complex multi-column checkbox layout that appears somewhat garbled in the extracted text — the column-based layout with checkboxes for Behavioral Health, Hospital Summary, Imaging Results, Treatment Records, etc. appears to have formatting challenges even in the native PDF.

**Font usage**: 14 fonts are used — substantially more than the English form-5 (9 fonts), suggesting a more complex typographic layout.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This form serves both purposes. Section 3 includes a "Mí (seleccione la opción de entrega abajo) (Myself)" checkbox alongside the third-party option. However, it is primarily framed as a disclosure/release authorization rather than a patient self-request. Advocate Health provides a separate, simpler patient self-request form (form-4), but **no Spanish-language version of that patient-request form was found**.

**Delivery options**: Notably robust for a Spanish-language form:
- LiveWell/MyAdvocateAurora patient portal
- Mail to patient's address
- View on site
- Pick up (with option for another person with photo ID)
- Paper or electronic format options

**Scope options**: Patients can specify date ranges (Section 5), select from detailed record type checkboxes (Section 6), and opt out of sensitive information categories (Section 7) including developmental disabilities/mental health, substance use disorder, HIV test results, and AIDS-related illness.

**Date range default**: "Si lo deja en blanco, solo se revelará información de los últimos dos (2) años." — If left blank, only the last 2 years of information will be disclosed. This is a significant limitation that could silently truncate records.

**Rights language**: Section 10 explains the right to inspect and copy records, the right to revoke authorization in writing, and warns about potential re-disclosure. It does not specifically cite HIPAA § 164.524 or mention EHI export.

**Fees**: Section 9 indicates "sin cargo" (no charge) for further medical care, but charges apply for insurance, legal, personal, and forms completion purposes. Specific fee amounts are not disclosed.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: Section 8 offers 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, or custom date. If left blank, the authorization expires in 1 year — a reasonable default. An Illinois-specific note states: "La información de los expedientes de salud mental/discapacidad del desarrollo solo se puede revelar el día que se recibe la autorización" — mental health/developmental disability records in Illinois can only be disclosed on the day the authorization is received, which is a state law requirement.

**Sensitive information handling**: Section 7 defaults to **including** all sensitive information (genetic, mental health, substance use, HIV/AIDS) and requires patients to affirmatively check boxes to **exclude** categories. This opt-out approach means patients who don't carefully read section 7 may inadvertently authorize release of sensitive records.

**Witness requirement**: Section 12 requires a witness signature for Illinois patients when mental health or developmental disabilities records are disclosed — this is an Illinois state law requirement (405 ILCS 5/5-101), not an unreasonable barrier.

**No notarization** required. No indication of in-person-only submission. Fees mentioned but not quantified upfront.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Sensitive information opt-out default**: Section 7 states the disclosure "puede incluir información relacionada con pruebas genéticas... salud mental... trastorno por consumo de sustancias, resultados de pruebas de VIH..." and requires patients to check boxes to **exclude** these categories. This opt-out framing (include everything unless you say otherwise) risks over-disclosure of sensitive records, particularly for patients who may not fully understand the form — a heightened concern for a Spanish-language form potentially serving patients with limited English proficiency.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Two-year default date range**: The note "Si lo deja en blanco, solo se revelará información de los últimos dos (2) años" could silently truncate a patient's records request. A patient seeking their complete medical history might not realize they need to fill in specific dates to get records older than two years.
- **Version mismatch with English form**: Form-6 (S23623-SP, Rev. 06/24) does not share a form number with the English form-5 (S300503, Rev. 11/25). The English version was revised 5 months later, raising questions about whether the Spanish form reflects current policies, field options, and legal language. For example, form-5 consolidates to 1 page while form-6 spans 3 pages with different section numbering and layout.
- **No Spanish patient self-request form**: The primary patient access form (form-4, "Patient Request for Health Information") appears to exist only in English. Spanish-speaking patients seeking their own records must use this more complex third-party disclosure form, which is not optimized for patient self-access.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Garbled checkbox layout in Section 6**: The extracted text for the record-type checkboxes shows significant formatting issues — column-based content is interleaved in ways that make it difficult to parse (e.g., "Resumen del hospital" and "Resultados de pruebas de diagnóstico por imágenes" appear mid-line alongside unrelated items). While this may render better visually in the PDF, the column layout is complex enough to be confusing even on paper.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Bilingual labeling throughout**: Every field label includes both Spanish and English text, which helps bilingual staff assist patients and reduces the risk of filing/processing errors in an English-dominant healthcare system.
- **Integrated instructions page**: Page 3 provides section-by-section completion instructions in Spanish, eliminating the need to locate a separate instructions document (which exists only in English as form-7).
- **Multiple delivery options for self-access**: The form offers patient portal, mail, on-site viewing, and pick-up options with paper or electronic format choices — matching the English form's delivery flexibility.
- **Existence of a Spanish-language form at all**: Many healthcare organizations do not provide ROI forms in any language other than English. Advocate Health's provision of a Spanish authorization form, linked from the main medical records page, is a meaningful accessibility measure.
