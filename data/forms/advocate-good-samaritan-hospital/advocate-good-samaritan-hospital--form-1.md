# Evaluation: Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**Form title**: "General Release of Information"
**Document type**: Employee Assistance Program (EAP) release form — NOT a hospital medical records ROI form.

This is an Aurora Employee Assistance Program form authorizing release of mental health, developmental disability, and/or drug and alcohol abuse treatment information from the EAP. The form is issued by "Aurora Employee Assistance Program, 4067 N. 92nd St, Wauwatosa, WI, 53222" and bears form number "275C Release of Information-General…06/14/2016."

**Relationship to other forms found**: Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital is part of the Advocate Health system, which provides seven forms on its website. This form is one of two EAP-related forms (along with form-3, a supervisory/administrative referral version). The forms actually relevant to a patient requesting hospital medical records are form-4 ("Patient Request for Health Information," the patient-access-specific form) and form-5 ("Authorization to Release Protected Health Information," the general third-party authorization). Form-6 is a Spanish-language authorization, form-7 is instructions, and form-2 is an older AMG-specific release. Form-1 serves a narrow, employer-benefit-specific purpose and would not be used by a typical patient seeking their hospital records.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was found via web search for `"Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf`, which returned direct PDF URLs from the Advocate Health website. Its source URL (`/documents/employer-solutions/release-of-information-general.PDF`) sits within the "employer-solutions" path, not the patient-facing medical records section. The medical records page at `advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records` does **not** link to this form — it links only to form-4, form-5, form-6, and form-7.

A patient searching for how to request their medical records would not encounter this form through normal navigation. It surfaces only through broad PDF-targeted web searches. The filename "release-of-information-general.PDF" is misleadingly generic and could cause confusion if a patient found it out of context, since it appears to be a general ROI form but is actually EAP-specific.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (2,826 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. All blanks are represented as underscored lines. A patient would need to print and hand-fill or use PDF annotation tools.
- **Page count**: 1 page.
- **File size**: 71,615 bytes (~70 KB) — appropriately small for a single-page document.
- **Fonts**: 8 fonts embedded, suggesting a reasonably structured digital document.
- **Embedded images**: 1 (likely a logo or header graphic).
- **Digital-first design**: No. The form uses blank lines with parenthetical labels (e.g., `(Name of Client)`, `(Date of Birth)`) — a print-oriented design. There are no interactive checkboxes; the checkbox items (e.g., "☐ To report attendance at EAP assessment") exist as text characters, not fillable form fields.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 1 page — appropriate for the form's narrow purpose.

**Clarity**: The form's language is moderately clear but has legal complexity. The "YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AUTHORIZATION" section is written in dense legalese: *"I understand that my revocation will not be effective as to uses and/or disclosures: (1) already made in reliance upon this Authorization; or (2) needed for an insurer to contest a claim/policy as authorized by law if signing the Authorization was a condition to obtaining insurance coverage."* This is technically accurate but inaccessible to most readers.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow — patient identification → recipient designation → purpose → information types → date range → expiration → rights → signatures → legal representative section. However, sections are not visually delineated with headers or borders, making it feel like a single block of text.

**Layout**: Compact and functional but visually undifferentiated. The checkbox items for "Purpose" and "Information to be disclosed" are the most structured portion. The rights section is a dense paragraph at the bottom with no visual break.

**Footer**: Contains address, phone/fax, and "COPY TO CLIENT" notation, plus the form number and revision date (06/14/2016), indicating this is a 10-year-old form revision.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This form is fundamentally **not designed for patients requesting their hospital medical records**. It is an EAP-specific form for authorizing release of EAP counseling/treatment information. Key observations:

- **Not a patient access form**: The form authorizes "Aurora Employee Assistance Program" to release information — it is not for requesting records from Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital.
- **Scope**: Limited to EAP program information (mental health, developmental disability, drug/alcohol treatment). Checkboxes include: "Report attendance at EAP assessment," "Compliance with treatment recommendations," "Failure to comply with EAP recommendations," and "Reports of progress and treatment."
- **No electronic delivery options**: The form has no mention of electronic delivery, patient portal, or digital access.
- **No HIPAA Right of Access reference**: The form references privacy rights generally ("I am aware that I have the right to inspect and receive a copy of the health information") but does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or frame it as a patient right of access.
- **No EHI export mention**: No reference to electronic health information export or bulk data.
- **Fee mention**: States "I understand that I may be charged a fee for record copies" without specifying amounts or HIPAA fee limitations.

A patient who mistakenly used this form to request their hospital records would not receive them — the form is addressed to a specific EAP office in Wauwatosa, WI.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Expiration**: "This Release is good until the following date(s)/events: If no date or event is specified, this Release will expire one (1) year from the date signed." This is a standard and reasonable default.
- **Revocation**: Provides for written revocation, with standard exceptions for disclosures already made. Acceptable.
- **Treatment conditioning**: The form states: "I understand that I do not need to sign this Authorization in order to receive treatment." This is compliant with HIPAA requirements.
- **Re-disclosure notice**: Includes notice that information "may be subject to re-disclosure and no longer protected by federal privacy law."
- **No notarization required**.
- **No in-person submission requirement stated**.
- **Legal representative provisions**: Includes checkboxes for minor, legally incompetent, and deceased individuals, with a parental custody declaration: "By signing above, I hereby declare that I have not been denied physical placement of this child."

No significant compliance concerns for its intended purpose (EAP information release). However, this form is irrelevant to hospital medical records requests.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Misleading discoverability**: The generic filename "release-of-information-general.PDF" and title "General Release of Information" could mislead a patient conducting a web search for Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital's ROI form. The form is actually an EAP-specific instrument for a program in Wauwatosa, WI — a patient in Downers Grove, IL requesting hospital records would be sending this to the wrong entity entirely.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Vague fee language**: The form states "I understand that I may be charged a fee for record copies" without specifying any fee schedule, HIPAA cost-based limitations, or how to obtain fee information. While this is an EAP form (and may not be subject to the same fee rules as a HIPAA right-of-access request), the lack of specificity is notable.
- **"Client" vs. "Patient" terminology**: The form uses "Client" throughout, which is appropriate for an EAP context but would confuse a hospital patient.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Outdated form revision**: The form is dated "06/14/2016" — nearly 10 years old. It still carries "Aurora" branding rather than "Advocate Health" or "Advocate Aurora Health," suggesting it has not been updated to reflect the organization's mergers and rebranding.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Concise single-page format**: Despite its limitations, the form efficiently covers its scope in a single page, which reduces patient burden.
- **Clear legal representative provisions**: The form includes structured options for legal representatives with specific categories (minor, legally incompetent, deceased) and the parental custody declaration, which is more thorough than many forms.
