# Boone County Health Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Boone County Health Center
- **Location:** Albion, NE
- **Website:** https://boonecohealth.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit, Midwest

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `"Boone County Health Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found a direct PDF link to an older (August 2017) version of the ROI form hosted on WordPress uploads.
2. **Web search** for `"Boone County Health Center" Albion Nebraska medical records release form` — confirmed the same PDF URL and identified the General Information page as the forms landing page.
3. **Site-specific search** for `site:boonecohealth.org patient forms medical records` — identified the General Information page URL.
4. **Browsed the website** at `https://boonecohealth.org/patient-resources-2/general-information-3/` using browser — found the "Patient Forms" section with a link to a newer .docx version of the ROI form (uploaded Feb 2026), plus a HIPAA Contact Form.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://boonecohealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Release_of_Health_Information_Form_August_2017.pdf
- **Format:** PDF (native, 1 page)
- **Description:** Older version of the "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, dated August 2017. Includes patient info, release FROM/TO fields, dates of service, purpose checkboxes, specific record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization (substance abuse, mental health, HIV/AIDS), and delivery format options (Paper, Fax, CD, USB). Has text layer. This was the original PDF linked from the site but has since been superseded by a .docx version.

### form-2.pdf (converted from form-2.docx)
- **Source URL:** https://boonecohealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Auth-for-Release-of-PHI.docx
- **Original format:** Microsoft Word .docx (converted to PDF via LibreOffice)
- **Description:** Current version of the "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form, uploaded February 2026. Updated address (1173 South 8th Street), includes email address (Roi@boonecohealth.org), adds encrypted email as a delivery option, has 12-month fixed expiration (vs. blank months in the older version), and uses "Protected Health Information" in the title. This is the version currently linked from the Patient Forms section of the website.

### form-3.pdf (converted from form-3.docx)
- **Source URL:** https://boonecohealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HIPAA-contact-form.docx
- **Original format:** Microsoft Word .docx (converted to PDF via LibreOffice)
- **Description:** "HIPAA Contact Information" form — NOT an ROI form. This form allows patients to designate individuals authorized to receive their medical and/or billing information. It includes a table for listing authorized contacts with their relationships and phone numbers. The form itself states: "This is not a substitute for a Release of Information form to obtain medical records."

## Difficulties
- The current ROI form is published as a .docx file, not a PDF — this is unusual and less accessible for patients who may not have Microsoft Word.
- The older PDF version is still accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the website's Patient Forms page.
- The website's General Information page required JavaScript rendering to see the links (static curl returned no form links).

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The form was findable through basic web search and was prominently listed on the Patient Forms section of their website (Patient Resources > General Information > Patient Forms).
