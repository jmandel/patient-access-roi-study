## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a single-page authorization form titled "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF CRESCENTCARE MEDICAL INFORMATION." It serves as the organization's primary ROI form for patients or authorized representatives to request disclosure of protected health information. CrescentCare also provides an identical Spanish-language version of this form (form-2.pdf, "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA LA DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN MÉDICA DE CRESCENTCARE"), which mirrors the English version in structure and content. Both are linked from the organization's Patient Resources and Downloads page. Notably, CrescentCare also offers a separate online records request submission option at https://www.crescentcare.org/records-request-form/, providing an alternative pathway beyond this PDF form.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was easy to locate. Per the retrieval notes, a straightforward web search for `CrescentCare New Orleans "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` returned the direct PDF URL. A site-specific search confirmed the URL and surfaced the dedicated Patient Resources and Downloads page (https://www.crescentcare.org/patient-resources-and-downloads/), where the form is prominently listed alongside other patient documents. The file URL is descriptive: `Release-of-CrescentCare-Medical-Information._en.pdf` — it clearly conveys the document's purpose and language. Retrieval difficulty was rated "Easy" with no difficulties encountered. The organization also maintains a dedicated "Request your medical records" page, further improving discoverability.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present and complete. The full document text (3,846 characters) is cleanly extractable with no OCR artifacts or garbled text.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero interactive form fields (`fillable_field_count: 0`). The document uses printed underlines for handwritten entry (e.g., "Full Name: _____"). This is a print-and-fill design, not a digital-first form.
- **Page count:** 1 page — compact and efficient.
- **File size:** 109,920 bytes (~107 KB) for a single page with 2 embedded images (likely logos) and 6 fonts. This is reasonable.
- **Format:** The document has a proper text layer and is not an image-only scan (`is_image_only_scan: false`). However, the lack of fillable fields means patients must print the form, complete it by hand, and submit it physically or by scanning — unless they use the separate online records request option.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality:** The form fits on a single page, which is appropriate for an authorization of this scope. It covers all necessary elements without being cluttered or padded.

**Organization:** The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient Information → Recipient of Information → Information to Be Disclosed → Special Authorization for Sensitive Records → Purpose of Disclosure → Expiration → Patient Rights and Acknowledgments → Signature. This ordering makes intuitive sense for a patient filling it out sequentially.

**Clarity:** The language is plain and accessible. Instructions are brief and direct. The "Patient Rights and Acknowledgments" section uses clear, non-legalistic bullet points:
- "I understand that I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time..."
- "I understand that my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on my signing this authorization."
- "I understand that once my information is released, it may be redisclosed by the recipient and may no longer be protected by HIPAA."

**Record type specificity:** The form provides six checkboxes for record types (Complete Medical Record, Immunization Records, Lab/Pathology Results, Visit Notes, Dental Record, Diagnostic Reports) plus an "Other (Specify)" option. This gives patients meaningful granularity.

**Sensitive records handling:** The form includes a dedicated section requiring specific patient initials for three categories of sensitive information: Behavioral Health Records, Substance Use Disorder Records, and HIV/AIDS Testing & Treatment. This is appropriately separated and compliant with Louisiana law and 42 CFR Part 2 requirements.

**Recipient section:** The form smartly separates self-request from third-party release, with the "Myself via" option appearing first, followed by "Or to:" for third-party recipients. This is a clear, patient-centered design choice.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Self-request pathway:** The form explicitly addresses patients requesting their own records with the "Myself via (check one)" option, offering three delivery methods: Patient Portal, Encrypted Email, and Pick Up. This is a meaningful range of options, with two electronic choices.

**Delivery options:** The inclusion of "Patient Portal" and "Encrypted Email" as delivery mechanisms is notable — these are electronic delivery options that align with HIPAA's Right of Access provisions encouraging electronic delivery when requested. "Pick Up" is the only non-electronic option for self-requests.

**Purpose options:** The form lists several purpose checkboxes (Continuity of Care, Insurance, Legal, Personal Use, School/Work, Other) and includes a sub-option under Continuity of Care: "I am no longer a CrescentCare patient/client." This is thoughtful — former patients are a common use case for records requests.

**Missing elements:** The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. There is no mention of EHI export, bulk data, or the patient's right to receive records in an electronic format of their choosing. There is no mention of fees or response timeframes, and there is no date range field allowing the patient to limit the scope of records to a specific time period.

**Representative authorization:** The form includes a section for someone other than the patient to sign, with checkboxes for Parent of Minor, Legal Guardian, Power of Attorney, and Other — with space for name, relationship, and contact information.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Unconditional authorization:** The form explicitly states: "I understand that my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on my signing this authorization." This is a required HIPAA element and is properly included.

**Revocation rights:** The form clearly states that the authorization can be revoked "in writing at any time by submitting a signed letter to CrescentCare, except to the extent that disclosure has already occurred." The revocation mechanism is clear, though requiring a "signed letter" is slightly more burdensome than simply accepting any written request.

**Expiration:** The authorization defaults to 1 year, with an option to specify a different date "not to exceed 12 months" or an event. The 12-month cap is reasonable. However, the form says it "will expire in 1 year unless otherwise indicated below" and then the field says "not to exceed 12 months" — these are functionally identical, meaning the "otherwise indicated" customization can only shorten the authorization, not extend it.

**Re-disclosure warning:** The form properly warns that "once my information is released, it may be redisclosed by the recipient and may no longer be protected by HIPAA."

**No fees disclosed:** The form does not mention any fees for records. This is neutral — it avoids discouraging patients but also doesn't set expectations.

**No submission instructions:** The form does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization (no mailing address, fax number, email address, or drop-off location is provided on the form itself). A patient printing and completing this form would not know where to send it without contacting CrescentCare separately.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Bilingual availability:** Providing both English and Spanish versions of the form, with identical structure, is a meaningful accessibility measure appropriate for New Orleans' patient population.
- **Electronic delivery options for self-requests:** The "Myself via" section offering Patient Portal and Encrypted Email as delivery methods is progressive and reduces barriers compared to forms that only offer mail or in-person pickup.
- **Multiple access pathways:** Beyond this PDF form, CrescentCare offers an online records request submission page, giving patients a fully digital alternative that doesn't require printing or scanning.
- **Clean single-page design:** Fitting a complete, well-organized ROI form — including sensitive records authorization, patient rights, and representative signature — onto a single page is efficient and respects patient time.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions on the form:** The form lacks any address, fax number, or email for submitting the completed authorization. A patient who downloads and fills this out has no guidance on how to return it.
- **Expiration language is slightly confusing:** The form states it "will expire in 1 year unless otherwise indicated below" but then caps customization at "not to exceed 12 months." The patient can only shorten, never extend, creating a somewhat misleading "unless otherwise indicated" framing.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **No fillable fields:** Despite being a digitally-distributed PDF linked from a web page, the form has zero interactive form fields. All entries require handwriting, making it a print-only document in practice. This is a design deficiency for a form intended for online distribution.
