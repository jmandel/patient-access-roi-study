# Valley Medical Group — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Valley Medical Group
- **Website:** https://www.vmgma.com
- **Location:** Amherst, MA (also Easthampton, Greenfield, Northampton)
- **Type:** Independent physician practice, for-profit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Valley Medical Group Amherst MA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — no direct VMG-specific form found.
2. **Web search** for `site:vmgma.com medical records release authorization` — no ROI form on vmgma.com.
3. **Web search** for `vmgma.com filetype:pdf` — found community resource PDFs, brochures, and health info PDFs, but no ROI/authorization form.
4. **Website navigation** — visited vmgma.com homepage, Resources page, Welcome Letter page, and Patient Information section. No downloadable ROI form found on the site.
5. **Key discovery on homepage:** VMG has a prominent "REQUEST RECORDS" link pointing to **https://medicopy.net/patients** — a third-party Release of Information service (MediCopy).
6. **MediCopy ROI page** (https://medicopy.net/landing/roi) — found downloadable PDF authorization forms in English and Spanish, plus online HelloSign forms.

## What Was Found

Valley Medical Group does **not** publish its own ROI/authorization form. Instead, they outsource medical records release to **MediCopy**, a third-party Health Information Management company based in Nashville, TN. The vmgma.com website links directly to MediCopy's patient portal from both the homepage header and the footer "REQUEST RECORDS" link.

MediCopy provides:
- An online authorization form via HelloSign (https://app.hellosign.com/s/01LCH5zj)
- Downloadable PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish)

**Note:** One web search result confused this Valley Medical Group (Amherst, MA — vmgma.com) with Valley Medical Group (part of Valley Health System in NJ — valleyhealth.com). These are completely different organizations. The valleyhealth.com authorization form is NOT for this practice.

## Downloaded Forms

## Difficulties
- VMG does not host any ROI form on their own website — they fully delegate to MediCopy.
- The forms are generic MediCopy forms, not customized for Valley Medical Group.
- Multiple "Valley Medical Group" organizations exist nationally, creating potential confusion in search results.
- The vmgma.com website is built on Wix and is primarily informational — patient forms and records are handled through external services (Athena patient portal, MediCopy).

## Retrieval Difficulty
**Moderate** — The form is not on vmgma.com itself, but the "REQUEST RECORDS" link to MediCopy is visible on the homepage. From MediCopy's site, the PDF authorization form is 2 clicks away.
