# Ben Taub Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name:** Ben Taub Hospital
- **Parent System:** Harris Health System
- **Website:** https://www.harrishealth.org
- **Location:** Houston, TX

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Ben Taub Hospital Harris Health "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF` — did not return direct PDF links but pointed to Harris Health's website.
2. **Web search** for `site:harrishealth.org authorization release medical records form` — found the main authorization form PDF URL and medical records page. Also surfaced a separate marketing/media authorization form.
3. **Fetched the Medical Records page** at `https://www.harrishealth.org/patients-hh/Pages/medical-records.aspx` — confirmed the authorization form link and documented the request process (mail, fax, email, or in-person drop-off).

The site:harrishealth.org search was the most effective, immediately surfacing both the primary ROI form and the medical records instructions page.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/280342-authorization-for-use-request-and-disclosure-of-phi.pdf
- **File size:** 430,439 bytes
- **Initial impression:** This is the primary ROI form — "Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." It covers all Harris Health facilities including Ben Taub Hospital. Includes patient information fields, recipient details, date range selection, facility selection (Ben Taub, LBJ, clinics), record type checkboxes (complete medical record, billing, ER, operative reports, radiology, lab, etc.), format options (paper), and sensitive information consent (drug/alcohol, psychiatric, HIV/AIDS). Has a text layer (not a scan).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/282758-authorization-for-marketing-and-educational-use-english.pdf
- **File size:** 594,254 bytes
- **Initial impression:** This is a separate "Authorization for Release of Information — Media, Marketing and Educational Use" form. Not an ROI form for patient access to their own records; this is for authorizing Harris Health to use patient information for media, marketing, or educational purposes. Includes consent for recordings (video, photo, audio), sensitive information release, and expiration/withdrawal provisions.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The forms were easy to find through web search and directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, no login walls, no JavaScript rendering issues.
- The medical records page is straightforward and clearly explains the request process.
- Only one ROI form was found (form-1.pdf); the second form (form-2.pdf) is a marketing authorization, not a patient records request form.
