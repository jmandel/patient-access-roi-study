# Evaluation: SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital – Madison — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page **"Authorization to Release Protected Health Information"** form specific to the Madison-area cluster of SSM Health facilities. The header lists six entities: SSM Health Dean Medical Group, SSM Health Surgery Center, SSM Health Digestive Health Center, SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital – Madison, SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital – Janesville, and SSM Health St. Clare Hospital – Baraboo. It is pre-filled with a shared PO Box address (PO Box 259840, Madison, WI 53725-9840) and separate fax numbers for Dean Medical Group (608-294-6294) and SSM Health Hospitals (608-270-6815).

This is one of three forms found for this organization. Form-1 is a generic Wisconsin-wide SSM Health authorization form (form code AH-FRM-11595, revised 8/2024). Form-2 is an older system-wide SSMHC "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure" form (DPM-2065-035, 1/2019). Form-3 (this document, code A9008836, dated 5/19 — i.e., May 2019) is the location-specific version for St. Mary's Madison and neighboring facilities. Of the three, form-3 is the most directly targeted at a patient seeking records from St. Mary's Hospital – Madison, but it is also the oldest (2019 vs. form-1's 2024 revision).

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, all three forms were found without significant difficulty. Form-3 was discovered through a location-specific search (`ssmhealth.com medical records request copy Wisconsin Madison`) and is hosted at a descriptive, facility-specific URL path: `…/patients-and-visitors/get-medical-records/wisconsin/st-marys-madison-medical-records-request-form.pdf`. This URL structure is well-organized and suggests SSM Health maintains a logical directory of location-specific forms. However, it required a fourth, more targeted search query to surface this form — the first three searches returned only the generic system-wide forms (form-1 and form-2). A patient navigating the SSM Health website via the "Get My Medical Records" page at `ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records` should reach this form, but the existence of three overlapping forms (system-wide, state-wide, and location-specific) could create confusion about which to use. Overall retrieval difficulty was rated **easy**.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (7,841 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive form fields despite having clear blank lines and checkbox areas (e.g., `q Continuing Care`, `q Personal Use`, format options like `q MyChart q DVD/CD q Paper`). All checkboxes appear as the character "q" in extracted text, indicating they are styled text characters rather than interactive checkbox widgets.
- **File size**: 79,647 bytes for 2 pages — reasonable and compact.
- **PDF version**: 1.5.
- **Fonts**: 4 fonts embedded.
- **Images**: 0 embedded images.
- **Digital-first design**: This is clearly designed as a print-oriented form. The lack of any fillable fields means a patient must print, hand-fill, and submit by fax or mail. The "q" characters used for checkboxes and the layout with blank lines and underscores confirm a print-first design philosophy.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — page 1 is the authorization form itself; page 2 ("ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION") is an informational supplement covering patient rights, who may sign, minor consent rules, fees, and contact information. This is a reasonable and proportionate length.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical numbered sequence: (1) patient information, (2) entity authorizing release (pre-filled as SSM Health), (3) recipient of information, (4) purpose of disclosure, (5) health information to be released, (5a) sensitive categories, (6) format, (7) expiration, (8) signature. This structure is clear and well-ordered.

**Clarity**: The opening paragraph is dense but covers essential HIPAA-required disclosures: redisclosure risk, right to refuse, right to revoke. The language is formal but not excessively legalistic. The instruction "(Complete in full. See reverse side for important information)" is helpful.

**Record type options**: Section 5 offers granular checkboxes: Office Visits, Procedures, Operative Reports, Emergency Room Report, Immunization Records, Discharge Summary, Lab Reports, History & Physical Exam, Imaging Reports, Medical Images, Billing Records, and a "Specific information related to" write-in field. Date range fields are also provided. This gives patients good control over scope.

**Purpose options**: Section 4 includes Continuing Care, Transferring Care, Personal Use, Insurance Eligibility/Benefits, Disability Determination, Legal Investigation, Worker's Compensation Research, and Other. The inclusion of "Personal Use" is notable — it explicitly acknowledges patient self-access as a legitimate purpose.

**Sensitive categories**: Section 5a uses an opt-out approach: "This authorization includes disclosure of information regarding mental health, alcohol and/or drug abuse, AIDS or AIDS-related illness, HIV/AIDS test results, developmental disabilities, and/or sexually transmitted infection, unless I limit the disclosure to exclude the following." This defaults to including sensitive records unless the patient actively excludes them.

**Page 2 content**: The supplemental information page is well-organized with bullet points covering Record Definition, Right to Refuse, Right to Inspect or Copy, Right to Receive Copy, Right to Revoke, Multiple Releases, Who May Sign (with detailed minor consent rules citing Wisconsin-specific ages), Fees, and Contact Office information. This is thorough and informative.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a general-purpose authorization form. It handles both patient self-access (Section 3 notes "If Release is to Self, State Self") and third-party release. Section 4 includes "Personal Use" as a purpose option. However, it is not specifically designed or optimized for patient self-access — the primary framing is as an authorization to release information to a named recipient.

**Format options**: Section 6 offers: MyChart, DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, Fax, and Email. The inclusion of **MyChart** as a format option is notable — it suggests records can be delivered through the patient portal. Email is also offered. This is a relatively strong set of delivery options.

**Scope control**: Patients can select specific record types (Section 5), specify date ranges, and limit sensitive categories (Section 5a). This gives meaningful control.

**HIPAA Right of Access language**: The form does not explicitly cite 45 CFR § 164.524 or use the phrase "Right of Access." Page 2 references the "patient's right to confidentiality of their health information under federal privacy regulations and Wisconsin law" and mentions "Right to Inspect or Copy the Health Information," but does not specifically frame this as a HIPAA Right of Access request. The 30-day response timeline is not mentioned on this form (it is mentioned on form-2).

**EHI Export / bulk data**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Contact information**: The form provides specific phone numbers (608-294-6244 for Dean Medical Group, 608-270-6806 for SSM Health Hospitals), mailing addresses, and a Privacy Officer email (PrivacyOfficer@ssmhealth.com). This is helpful.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: Section 7 states the authorization expires on a patient-specified date, defaulting to "one (1) year from the date of my signature" if no date is given. A 1-year default is standard and reasonable.

**Fees**: Section 8 states "I understand that there may be a charge for copies." Page 2 adds: "SSM Health may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records to fulfill this request. All fees are based on the applicable laws governing release of health information." No specific fee amounts are disclosed. The vague phrase "reasonable fee" and the inclusion of "viewing" in the fee categories is noteworthy — HIPAA limits fees for patient access requests to reasonable, cost-based fees and does not permit charging for inspection/viewing.

**Submission methods**: The form provides fax numbers and a mailing address. No explicit mention of in-person-only submission, which is good. No electronic submission option (e-signature, online portal submission) is mentioned — the form must be printed, signed, and faxed or mailed.

**Notarization**: Not required.

**Consent bundling**: The form does not bundle health information release with other unrelated authorizations.

**Photocopy clause**: "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" — a helpful and patient-friendly provision.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Three overlapping forms**: SSM Health publishes three different authorization forms applicable to St. Mary's Hospital – Madison (system-wide, state-wide, and location-specific). A patient is given no clear guidance about which form to use. Form-3 is from 2019 while form-1 was revised in 2024 — raising the question of whether form-3 is still current or has been superseded.
- **"Viewing" fee**: Page 2 states SSM Health "may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records." Under HIPAA's Right of Access rule, covered entities may not charge patients for inspecting their own records in person. Including "viewing" in the fee language could mislead patients into thinking inspection carries a cost.
- **Sensitive categories opt-out framing**: Section 5a defaults to *including* all sensitive information (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, etc.) unless the patient explicitly limits the disclosure. While legally permissible, this could lead to unintended disclosure of sensitive records if a patient doesn't carefully read the clause.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Outdated form**: The form code is "A9008836 (5/19)" — dated May 2019. The Wisconsin-wide form (form-1) was revised in August 2024. Form-3's contact information and facility listings may be out of date, and it lacks updates that form-1 received (e.g., form-1 lists additional facilities like St. Agnes Hospital, Ripon Community Hospital, Waupun Memorial Hospital, Fond du Lac Regional Clinic, and Monroe Hospital and Clinic).
- **Checkbox rendering**: All checkboxes appear as "q" in the extracted text (e.g., "q SCAN ONLY", "q Continuing Care"), suggesting the PDF uses a symbol font for checkbox glyphs. While they likely render correctly visually, this harms text extraction and accessibility for screen readers.
- **"Worker's Compensation Research"**: Section 4 lists "Worker's Compensation Research" as a single combined option. This appears to conflate "Worker's Compensation" and "Research" into one checkbox — likely a formatting or spacing error where these should be two separate options.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **MyChart as a delivery format**: Section 6 includes "MyChart" as a records format option alongside DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, Fax, and Email. Offering patient portal delivery is a strong digital-forward option that few organizations provide on their authorization forms.
- **"Personal Use" as an explicit purpose**: Section 4 includes "Personal Use" as a checkbox option, explicitly validating patient self-access as a recognized and routine purpose for requesting records.
- **Detailed minor consent rules**: Page 2 provides Wisconsin-specific age thresholds for minor consent to release (age 12+ for substance abuse, 14+ for mental health, 14+ for HIV), which is unusually thorough and helpful for navigating complex minor access rules.
- **Photocopy validity**: The statement "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" reduces friction for patients who may need to retain a copy or submit via fax.
