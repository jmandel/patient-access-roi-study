## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-1 is a **generic Wisconsin-wide SSM Health authorization form** titled "AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION." It is a 2-page flat PDF (44,626 bytes) covering all SSM Health Wisconsin facilities — it is not specific to St. Mary's Hospital - Madison but applies to it.

This organization has **three forms** available online:
- **form-1** (this document): Wisconsin ministries-wide authorization form (2 pages, revised 8/2024)
- **form-2**: SSMHC system-wide "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure" form (1 page, dated 1/2019) — more comprehensive, includes access type and delivery method options
- **form-3**: Location-specific Madison-area authorization form (2 pages, dated 5/2019) — pre-filled with Madison PO Box and fax numbers, lists specific facilities including St. Mary's Hospital - Madison

Form-1 is the **most recently revised** (8/2024) and covers the broadest scope (all Wisconsin SSM Health ministries). It is structured as a general-purpose release authorization — not specifically a patient access request form. The back page lists contact offices for multiple Wisconsin facilities including St. Mary's Hospital-Madison. It is notably similar to form-3 in structure but lacks the pre-filled facility header and addresses that form-3 provides.

## 2. FINDABILITY

According to retrieval notes, form-1 was found through standard web searches for SSM Health authorization/release forms. The search `SSM Health "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` surfaced this PDF among others. The file was also discoverable through `site:ssmhealth.com` searches and is linked from the SSM Health medical records request page at `ssmhealth.com/resources/get-my-medical-records`.

The URL path (`/getmedia/4f4b2386-365a-4227-83b2-4ea09365a347/ssm-health-medical-records-release-forms-wisconsin-ministries.pdf`) uses a GUID-based CMS structure but has a descriptive filename suffix (`ssm-health-medical-records-release-forms-wisconsin-ministries.pdf`), which helps with searchability. No bot blocking or JavaScript barriers were encountered — the PDF was directly downloadable via curl.

However, having **three overlapping forms** creates potential confusion. A patient at St. Mary's Madison would need to determine which of the three forms to use. The notes characterize retrieval difficulty as **easy** overall.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (7,780 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite having structured sections with blanks for patient name, address, dates, checkboxes, and signature, **none are interactive form fields**. The form uses underscores (`______________________________________________`) to indicate write-in areas and the letter "o" as checkbox stand-ins.
- **File size:** 44,626 bytes for 2 pages — very compact. No embedded images; only 3 fonts.
- **PDF version:** 1.6
- **Digital-first design:** This is clearly a **print-oriented form** that was likely created in a word processor or layout tool. The underscore-based field lines, lack of fillable fields, and "o" characters used as checkbox bullets all indicate a design intended for printing and hand-filling. The instruction "(Complete in full. See reverse side for important information.)" uses print-era language ("reverse side").

The form cannot be completed electronically without third-party annotation tools. A patient would need to print the form, fill it by hand, and then mail or fax it back.

---

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages — front is the authorization form itself, back is "Additional Information Regarding Release of Health Information." This is proportionate for the content.

**Organization:** The form uses a numbered section structure (1–8):
1. Patient identifying information
2. Authorize (SSM Health pre-filled)
3. Release to (recipient)
4. Purpose or need for disclosure (checkboxes)
5. Health information to be released (checkboxes + date range)
5a. Special categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, developmental disabilities)
6. Format for records
7. Expiration
8. Signature

This is a logical flow from who → to whom → why → what → how → when → sign.

**Clarity:** The introductory paragraph in section 1 uses moderately complex legal language: "I understand that the information used or released as a result of this Authorization may no longer be protected by federal privacy laws and may be further used or released by persons or organizations receiving it without obtaining my authorization." This is standard HIPAA authorization language but is dense for a lay reader. The back page is more accessible, using bullet points to explain patient rights.

**Layout:** The front page is moderately dense. Sections 4 and 5 pack multiple checkbox options onto limited space. The back page uses bullet points with bolded headers, making it more scannable.

**Font size:** Not determinable from metadata alone, but the text appears to be standard print size given the amount of content fitting on 2 pages.

**Minor issues:** The form uses plain "o" characters as checkbox markers rather than proper checkbox symbols (☐), which may confuse patients. The word "affect" is misspelled as "afect" in two places on the front page: "will not afect my ability to obtain treatment" and "will not afect any action taken."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This form is a **general-purpose authorization** form, not specifically designed for patient self-access. Section 3 instructs: "(If release is to self, state self)" — so a patient requesting their own records would write "self" in the recipient field. There is no dedicated pathway or simplified process for patient access requests. By contrast, form-2 explicitly includes a "For personal access" purpose option with sub-choices for "Copy," "Inspection," and "Summary."

**Purpose options (Section 4):** Includes "Personal Use" as one checkbox option among others (Continuing Care, Transferring Care, Insurance, Disability, Legal, Other). This at least acknowledges patient self-requests.

**Scope options (Section 5):** Reasonably granular — patients can select specific record types (Office Visits: Primary Care or Specialty, Procedures, Immunization Records, Lab Reports, X-ray Reports, X-ray Films, Billing Records) and specify a date range. Section 5a handles special categories requiring additional consent.

**Format options (Section 6):** Offers multiple delivery formats: "MyChart, DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, Email to: ___." The inclusion of MyChart and email is notable — these are digital delivery options that many forms lack.

**Right of Access language:** The back page states: "Right to Inspect or Copy the Health Information to Be Used or Disclosed: A patient has the right to inspect or copy the health information they have authorized to be used or disclosed by signing this Authorization form." This references inspection and copy rights but does **not** cite HIPAA § 164.524 or use the phrase "Right of Access" explicitly.

**EHI Export:** No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Fees:** The back page states: "SSM Health may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records to fulfill this request. All fees are based on the applicable laws governing release of health information." No specific fee schedule is provided, and the mention of fees for "viewing" records is notable — HIPAA limits fees for patient access requests.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration (Section 7):** "This authorization will expire on ___. If I do not indicate a date, this will expire one (1) year from the date of my signature below." A one-year default expiration is standard and not unreasonable for a general authorization.

**Submission methods:** The form does not explicitly state how to submit it, though the back page provides mailing addresses and fax numbers for specific facilities. There is no explicit prohibition on electronic submission, but no electronic submission pathway is offered either. The "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" statement is helpful.

**No notarization required.** No in-person-only submission requirement. No identity verification beyond signature.

**Minor representative provisions:** Section 8 requires a representative to provide name and relationship but the form does not demand notarized proof of authority on its face (the back page does state that representatives "must state their relationship to the patient and provide proof of legal authority").

**Fees for "viewing":** The back page mentions charging for "viewing" records. Under HIPAA, a covered entity may not charge for supervised inspection of records by the patient, though they may charge for copies. The language "a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records" could be read as charging for inspection, which would be problematic under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Fees for "viewing" records:** The back page states SSM Health "may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records." Under HIPAA's Right of Access rule (45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4)), a covered entity may not charge for supervised patient inspection of their own records. The inclusion of "viewing" alongside "copying" could deter patients from exercising their inspection rights or be applied improperly.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Which form to use?** SSM Health publishes three overlapping forms for this facility. A patient at St. Mary's Madison could reasonably encounter any of the three and would have no clear guidance on which to use. Form-1 is the most recently revised (8/2024) but lacks Madison-specific addressing. Form-3 is pre-filled with Madison addresses but is dated 5/2019. Form-2 has more explicit patient access options but is a system-wide SSMHC form dated 1/2019.
- **"o SCAN ONLY-No additional information needed"** appears at the top of the form with no context. This appears to be an internal processing instruction (likely for HIM staff scanning the form into a document management system) that has been left visible to patients, adding confusion.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Misspelling of "affect":** The word appears as "afect" (missing one "f") in two places on the front page: "will not afect my ability to obtain treatment or payment of claims" and "will not afect any action taken before receipt of the written revocation." This is a basic proofreading error in a legal document revised as recently as August 2024.
- **Checkbox rendering:** The form uses the lowercase letter "o" as checkbox markers rather than proper checkbox symbols (☐), which is a formatting deficiency in the extracted text and likely reflects poor typography in the PDF itself.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Multiple delivery format options:** Section 6 offers MyChart, DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, and Email — providing genuine electronic delivery pathways that many provider forms lack entirely. The MyChart option is particularly patient-friendly for those already enrolled in the portal.
- **Comprehensive back-page patient rights information:** The back page provides a thorough, organized explanation of patient rights including the right to refuse, right to inspect, right to revoke, who may sign, and minor-specific consent rules with age thresholds. This is more detailed than many comparable forms.
- **Photocopy validity:** The statement "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" removes a potential barrier for patients who may not be near a printer or who submit via fax.
