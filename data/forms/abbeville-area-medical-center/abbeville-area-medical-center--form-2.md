## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) form. It is a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP) formatted as a brochure. The document describes how Abbeville Area Medical Center uses and discloses protected health information, enumerates patient rights, and explains how to file complaints. It was found on the same Medical Records page as the actual ROI form (form-1.pdf, "AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION"). The two documents serve complementary but distinct purposes: form-1 is the actionable authorization patients fill out; form-2 is an informational notice patients receive.

The NPP covers AAMC and "any Abbeville Area Medical Center owned Physician Practices, services provided by Health Related Home Care and any other AAMC services," indicating it applies across the organization's service lines.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this document was found by scraping the Medical Records page at `https://www.abbevilleareamc.com/abbeville-area-medical-center/patients-visitors/medical-records/`. It is directly linked alongside the ROI form. The URL path (`HIPAA-Brochure-AAMC-Rev-07-2017-legal.pdf`) is reasonably descriptive — a patient could infer this is a HIPAA-related brochure. However, the filename includes a revision date (2017) and the word "legal," which may not be intuitive for patients looking for a plain-language privacy notice.

The Medical Records page itself is accessible within 2–3 clicks from the homepage (Home → Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), making the document easy to locate once you know where to look. There was no bot blocking or login required.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: The PDF has a full text layer with 13,455 extractable characters. The text is well-structured and reads coherently when extracted, indicating it was digitally authored rather than scanned.

**Fillable fields**: Zero, which is appropriate — this is an informational brochure, not a form patients fill out.

**File size**: At 651 KB for a 2-page document, the file is moderately large, likely due to 3 embedded images and 14 fonts. This is not unusual for a designed brochure but is heavier than necessary for what is primarily text content.

**Format**: The document appears to be designed as a tri-fold or bi-fold brochure layout, with a cover panel ("NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES") and interior content panels. The extracted text flows reasonably well despite the multi-column brochure format, suggesting competent PDF construction.

---

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: Two pages is appropriate for an NPP brochure — it covers the required topics without excessive length.

**Clarity**: The language is a mix of plain English and necessary legal terminology. Opening sections like "Our Legal Duty" and "Protected Health Information" use accessible language: "We are required by law to protect and maintain the privacy of your protected health information." The examples under Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations are concrete and helpful: "For example, nurses, physicians, and other members of our treatment team will record information in your record and use it to determine the most appropriate course of care."

However, some sections become dense, particularly the "Other Uses and Disclosures Permitted Without Authorization" section, which is a long bulleted list covering law enforcement, military, research, business associates, and more. This is standard NPP content but may overwhelm a lay reader.

**Organization**: The document follows a logical structure: legal duty → what PHI is → how it's used (with examples) → disclosures without authorization → individual rights → complaints → contact info. This mirrors the structure recommended by HHS guidance.

**Visual design**: With 14 fonts and 3 embedded images, the brochure appears to use intentional typography and design elements. The cover panel prominently displays "THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY." in what reads as emphasized/bold text.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Rights enumeration**: The document does enumerate patient rights in an "Individual Rights" section, including:
- Request restrictions on uses/disclosures
- Request confidential communications
- Inspect and obtain copies of PHI
- Right to electronic copy of electronic medical records
- Amend information
- Accounting of disclosures
- Opt out of fundraising
- Notice of breaches
- Paper copy of the notice

**Right to electronic records**: The document includes a notable passage on electronic access: "When protected health information is maintained in an electronic format (electronic medical record – EMR), you have the right to request that an electronic copy of your record be given to you or transmitted to a clearly, conspicuously and specifically identified entity or person." This is a meaningful inclusion that many NPPs omit or understate.

**30-day timeline**: The document states "We have up to 30 days to make your Protected Health Information available to you," which accurately reflects the HIPAA timeline.

**Fee disclosure**: The document mentions "there will be a charge for the copies" and "there will be a charge for the labor associated with transmitting the electronic medical record" but does not specify amounts. This is vague but not atypical for an NPP.

**Health Information Exchange opt-out**: The document includes a section on Health Information Exchanges, noting patients can opt out by contacting the Privacy Officer at 864-366-3313. This is informative but places the burden on the patient to proactively opt out.

**Contact information**: The Privacy Officer's mailing address (P.O. Box 887, Abbeville, SC 29646) and phone number (864-366-5011) are provided. A second phone number (864-366-3313) appears in the HIE section specifically.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Effective and revision dates**: The notice has an effective date of September 23, 2013, and was revised February 6, 2017. As of the retrieval date, this document is approximately 9 years old. While NPPs don't require frequent updates unless practices change, the age is worth noting — it predates the 21st Century Cures Act's information blocking rules (effective 2021).

**Self-pay restriction rights**: The document correctly notes the post-HITECH obligation: "We are not required to agree to such restrictions unless the requested restriction concerns a disclosure of protected health information to a health plan for the purpose of carrying out payment and health care operations (but not treatment) and the protected health information pertains solely to a health care item or service for which AAMC has been paid by you out of pocket in full."

**Complaint rights**: The document notes patients can file complaints with the Office of Civil Rights and "will not be penalized in any way for filing a complaint," which is appropriate.

**Marketing and fundraising**: The document distinguishes marketing from fundraising and notes the right to opt out of fundraising communications "with each solicitation." However, the marketing section ("We may send you information on the latest treatment, and other resources affecting your health") is vague about whether this constitutes marketing requiring authorization under HIPAA.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Fee language is vague**: "There will be a charge for the copies" and "there will be a charge for the labor associated with transmitting the electronic medical record" — no fee schedule, no reference to reasonable cost-based fees, and no distinction between patient-access fees (which HIPAA limits) and third-party release fees.
- **Marketing section is unclear**: "We may send you information on the latest treatment, and other resources affecting your health" could be interpreted as treatment communications (no authorization needed) or marketing (authorization required). The document lists this under disclosures not requiring authorization, which may not always be correct depending on the nature of the communication.
- **Two different phone numbers** appear (864-366-5011 for general contact; 864-366-3313 for HIE opt-out) without explanation of which to call for what purpose beyond the specific HIE context.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Mailing address inconsistency**: The body text gives the Privacy Officer address as "P.O. Box 887, Abbeville, SC 29620" while the contact section at the end lists "P.O. Box 887, Abbeville, SC 29646." The correct ZIP code for Abbeville, SC is 29620; the 29646 appears to be a typo (29646 is the ZIP for Greenwood, SC).
- **Document age**: Revised February 2017, predating significant regulatory changes including the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (2021) and ONC's TEFCA framework. The document makes no mention of information blocking prohibitions or patients' rights under the Cures Act.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Electronic records access language**: The explicit mention of patients' right to request "an electronic copy of your record be given to you or transmitted to a clearly, conspicuously and specifically identified entity or person" is a meaningful and specific articulation of electronic access rights that many provider NPPs lack.
- **Health Information Exchange transparency**: Including a dedicated section on HIE participation with an opt-out mechanism and a specific phone number shows above-average transparency about data sharing practices.
