## Organization
- **Name:** JPS Health Network (John Peter Smith Hospital)
- **Website:** https://jpshealthnet.org
- **Location:** Fort Worth, TX
- **Type:** Community hospital, government-owned

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"JPS Health Network" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for `"JPS Health Network" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found the main ROI form URL and HIE-related forms.
3. **Web search** for `site:jpshealthnet.org authorization release medical records` — found the Patient Records page at https://jpshealthnet.org/patient-tools/patient-records.
4. **Website navigation** — visited the Patient Records page, confirmed form links via browser JavaScript.

The Patient Records page (https://jpshealthnet.org/patient-tools/patient-records) is the main hub. It has expandable accordion sections for "JPS Authorization Form", "Cost of Medical Records", and "Health Information Exchange".

## Difficulties
- The main ROI form (form-1.pdf) is an **image-only scan** from 2018 with no text layer and no fillable fields. This is a significant accessibility barrier.
- The page states "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time" — patients must print, fill, and mail/fax.
- The page also notes that patients must present government-issued photo ID at pickup.
- Fee schedule is disclosed: $30 for first 10 pages, then per-page charges. Electronic/digital delivery costs a flat $75.

## Retrieval Difficulty
**Easy** — The form is findable on the Patient Records page within 2 clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records). Web search also returned the direct PDF URL.
