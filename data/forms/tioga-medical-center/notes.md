# Tioga Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies
1. **Web search** for `Tioga Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found the HIM page at https://www.tiogahealth.org/him
2. **Site-specific search** for `site:tiogahealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed same HIM page
3. **Direct navigation** to the HIM page to locate download links

## What Worked
The web search was sufficient. The form is directly linked from the Health Information Management page (https://www.tiogahealth.org/him), which is accessible from the site navigation under TMC. Both Word and PDF versions are offered.

## Difficulties
- The PDF is an image-only scan with no text layer, making it impossible to extract text via pdftotext. The form content was confirmed visually via screenshot.
- The form appears to be a scan of a paper form rather than a digitally-created document.

## Other Documents Available on HIM Page
The HIM page also links to:
- Release of Information Form (Word format) — same form in .docx
- HIPAA / Notice of Privacy Practices (.doc and .pdf versions)
- Various other documents (Advance Directive, ACO info, Community Health Needs Assessment, etc.)
