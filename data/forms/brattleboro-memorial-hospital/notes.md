# Brattleboro Memorial Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies
- Web search for `"Brattleboro Memorial Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links on bmhvt.org.
- Web search for `"Brattleboro Memorial Hospital" "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same forms and found a second consent form.
- Web search for `site:bmhvt.org authorization release medical records` — found an additional DOCX version of the authorization form.

All three forms were found on the first round of searching. The hospital publishes multiple versions of ROI-related forms directly as uploaded files on their WordPress site.

Converted to PDF for consistent analysis.

## Difficulties Encountered
- No significant difficulties. All forms were publicly accessible without login, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering requirements.
- One form (form-3) was a .docx rather than PDF; converted with LibreOffice.
- The hospital has multiple versions of essentially the same form available, which may reflect different revision dates or distribution channels.

## Summary
Brattleboro Memorial Hospital makes ROI forms readily available. The primary form (form-1.pdf, dated 1/2025) is a modern, fillable PDF with comprehensive patient rights language. Form-2 appears to be an older, simpler version. Form-3 is a Word document version similar to form-1 but lacking some newer language. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.
