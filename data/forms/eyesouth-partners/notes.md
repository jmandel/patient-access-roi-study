# EyeSouth Partners — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a **practice management organization (PMO)** headquartered in Atlanta, GA. It is not a direct clinical practice but rather a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. The main website (eyesouthpartners.com) is corporate/partnership-focused with no patient-facing forms or medical records pages. However, their privacy policy (updated January 2026) identifies "Eye South Partners" as a HIPAA covered entity.

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **EyeSouth Partners is a PMO, not a clinical practice** — The main website has no patient-facing content, no forms, no medical records request process. This is a significant barrier for patients who may not know which specific affiliated practice to contact.

2. **No centralized ROI form** — Despite being a HIPAA covered entity with a Privacy Officer, EyeSouth Partners does not provide a downloadable authorization form. Patients must write to the Privacy Officer or go through individual affiliated practices.

3. **Inconsistent approach across affiliates** — Some practices use Sharecare online portals (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye), while others offer downloadable PDFs (Georgia Retina, Center for Sight). This fragmented approach makes it difficult for patients to know how to request their records.

4. **Georgia Retina initial download attempt returned HTML** — The first URL tried (from an older WordPress upload path) redirected to an HTML page. The correct URL was found by navigating the practice website directly.

5. **Georgia Eye Partners forms page 404** — The founding practice's patient forms page no longer exists, suggesting a recent website change.
