## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page authorization form from **Georgia Retina**, an EyeSouth Partners affiliate operating 17+ locations in the Atlanta metro area. The form is titled "AUTHORIZATION FOR USE, RELEASE, OR REQUEST OF YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION" and is designed as a bidirectional release — patients circle whether records go "TO or FROM" Georgia Retina.

This is the second of two forms retrieved for the EyeSouth Partners network. Form-1 is from a different affiliate (Center for Sight, Florida). Neither form is from EyeSouth Partners itself; the parent organization provides no downloadable ROI form despite being a named HIPAA covered entity with a designated Privacy Officer. The two affiliate forms differ substantially in structure, language, and requirements — reflecting the decentralized, inconsistent approach across the network.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **not findable through the parent organization** (EyeSouth Partners). The corporate website has no patient resources section, no medical records page, and no downloadable forms. The privacy policy directs patients to write to a Privacy Officer but provides no form.

The form was located by identifying Georgia Retina as an EyeSouth-affiliated practice, then searching the practice's website directly. The URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/medical-records-release-and-request-6.30.16.pdf`) is a WordPress upload with a date-stamped filename, suggesting it was uploaded in 2016 and not updated since. The retrieval notes document that an initial download attempt returned HTML due to a redirect, requiring navigation through the practice site.

A patient who knows they're a Georgia Retina patient might find this form; a patient who only knows they received care under the EyeSouth Partners umbrella would likely not.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present and functional — full text is cleanly extractable (3,034 characters). This is a digitally-created document, not a scan.

**Fillable fields**: Zero. Despite being a digital PDF, none of the blank lines are interactive form fields. Patients must print and handwrite, or attempt to use PDF annotation tools to type over lines. The form has 7 fonts and 1 embedded image (likely a logo), consistent with a word-processed origin.

**File size**: 301 KB for a single page is moderately large, likely due to the embedded image. Not a barrier, but indicates no optimization.

**Digital-first design**: No. The form uses underscored blank lines (`___________`) for all data entry — a paper-first design pattern. There is no digital submission pathway mentioned. The form must be printed, completed by hand, and presumably faxed or mailed (a fax number field is provided for Georgia Retina).

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality**: One page is appropriate for a basic authorization form. The form manages to fit patient demographics, sender/receiver information, scope fields, rights disclosures, and signatures on a single page.

**Clarity**: The language is a mix of plain English and legal/regulatory phrasing. The rights statements are written in first person ("I understand that..."), which aids readability. However, some statements are dense — for example: "personal health information may not be released to outside parties, other than for payment, treatment, or business operation" bundles several HIPAA concepts into one clause without explanation.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient info → recipient/sender → scope → rights disclosures → signature. However, there is no clear visual sectioning — no headers, boxes, or dividers separating functional areas. The rights disclosures run together as a block of "I understand" statements without spacing.

**Layout**: The form is text-dense for a single page. The rights/disclosure statements consume roughly half the page, leaving limited space for the actual data-entry fields. The instruction "TO or FROM (please circle one)" is embedded inline, which could be easily missed.

**Field design**: The scope of records is handled with a single open-ended line: "Please list the information you would like released." There are no checkboxes for common record types (office notes, imaging, lab results, etc.), requiring patients to know what to ask for. There is a corresponding exclusion field: "The following information should not be released."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is a **general-purpose authorization** — it covers both patient access and third-party releases without distinguishing between them. The "TO or FROM" circling mechanism means the same form serves requests going in either direction. There is no language specifically addressing a patient's HIPAA Right of Access, no mention of 45 CFR § 164.524, and no acknowledgment that patients have a right to their own records.

**Scope options**: Minimal. The form offers one blank line for specifying what information to release and one line for exclusions. It explicitly calls out sensitive categories: "this information may include any history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), sexually transmitted diseases, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, behavioral health service/psychiatric care, treatment for alcohol and/or drug abuse." However, there are no checkboxes to make selection easy — patients must write in their requests.

**Date range**: No date range fields are provided. There is no way to specify a time period for the records requested.

**Format/delivery options**: None mentioned. No option for electronic delivery, CD, email, patient portal access, or any format specification.

**Reason for release**: A single line asks: "Please list the reason for releasing this information." Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients are not required to provide a reason for requesting their own records. This field, while perhaps not mandatory, could discourage patients or create the impression that a reason is required.

**Revocation**: The form states authorization can be revoked "in writing" to the Privacy Officer at a specific address (833 Campbell Hill St., Ste. 300, Marietta, GA 30060). This is clear and specific.

**Expiration**: "This authorization will expire: upon completion of this disclosure/use." This is reasonable — the authorization is scoped to a single transaction.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee disclosure**: The form states: "I understand Georgia Retina may charge up to $25 for the reproduction of my medical records based on guidelines from the state of Georgia and the federal government." This flat $25 fee claim is notable. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, fees must be limited to reasonable, cost-based fees for the labor of copying. The 2016 HHS guidance and subsequent enforcement actions have made clear that flat fees may exceed what HIPAA allows for patient access requests. Georgia state law (O.C.G.A. § 31-33-3) permits charges for medical records, but HIPAA preempts state law where the state law is less protective of patient rights. The form does not distinguish between patient access requests (where HIPAA fee limits apply) and third-party releases (where state fee schedules may apply).

**Voluntary participation**: The form correctly states the authorization is voluntary and will not affect healthcare or payment.

**Re-disclosure warning**: The form includes: "I understand that once my information is released, it may no longer be protected by federal privacy regulations." This is a standard HIPAA re-disclosure notice.

**Form age**: The form is dated "Updated 6/30/16" — nearly 10 years old at the time of evaluation. It predates significant HIPAA Right of Access enforcement (the HHS Office for Civil Rights began its Right of Access Initiative in 2019) and the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking provisions.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **$25 flat fee without distinguishing patient access**: The statement "Georgia Retina may charge up to $25 for the reproduction of my medical records" applies the same fee regardless of whether this is a patient access request or a third-party release. For patient access requests, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts — a flat $25 fee may exceed this, particularly for small requests or electronic copies. The form's framing as an "I understand" statement could lead patients to believe this fee is mandatory.

- **Reason-for-release field for patient access**: "Please list the reason for releasing this information" is asked without caveat. HIPAA does not require patients to state a reason when exercising their Right of Access. This could deter patients or be used as a basis for denying requests.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"TO or FROM (please circle one)"**: This critical instruction is embedded in a sentence rather than presented as a prominent choice. The bidirectional design means the form's meaning changes entirely based on which word is circled — yet the layout gives this choice no visual emphasis.

- **No date range mechanism**: Without date-range fields, it's unclear how a patient limits their request to a specific time period. The "Please list the information you would like released" line could accommodate this, but it's not guided.

- **Sensitive information disclosure**: The form states the release "may include" HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, and substance abuse records, with an exclusion field below. It is ambiguous whether these sensitive categories are included by default unless excluded, or whether separate authorization is needed (as required by some state laws and 42 CFR Part 2 for substance abuse treatment records).

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Outdated form (2016)**: The form predates the HHS Right of Access Initiative (2019), the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules (2021), and current HIPAA fee guidance. Its compliance posture and patient rights language do not reflect nearly a decade of regulatory evolution.

- **42 CFR Part 2 compliance gap**: The form mentions "treatment for alcohol and/or drug abuse" records as potentially included in a release. Federal regulation 42 CFR Part 2 requires specific, separate consent for substance use disorder treatment records with particular required elements. This form's blanket authorization likely does not meet those requirements.
