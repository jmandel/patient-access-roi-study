# Evaluation: MUSC Health University Medical Center — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form specific to the **MUSC College of Dental Medicine**. It is Version 9, dated 5/19, with a form origination date of 1/2000 (internal form ID: `all_all_consent_authorelease`, OTE 700078 Rev. 10/20).

Within the MUSC Health document set, this is the **dental-specific variant** of the general ROI authorization. It sits alongside:
- **form-1.pdf**: The current primary authorization form (Rev. 10/2023, 2 pages) covering all MUSC Health facilities including dental
- **form-2.pdf**: An older version (Version 11, dated 11/17) of the general authorization, hosted under the insurance section
- **form-4.pdf**: MyChart instructions document (not an authorization form)
- **form-5.pdf**: Spanish-language version of form-1

Notably, the newer form-1.pdf (Rev. 10/2023) now includes a dedicated dental records section ("FOR MUSC Dental RECORDS ONLY: □ Entire Dental Record") and lists the College of Dental Medicine contact information on its second page. This strongly suggests form-3.pdf has been **superseded** by form-1.pdf but remains available on the dental subpath of the website.

**Source URL**: `https://muschealth.org/-/sm/health/dental/dental-files/records-release.ashx?la=en`

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found through a web search for `"MUSC Health" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` and is hosted under the dental section of the MUSC Health website. It was **not linked from the main medical records page** — rather, it lives under a dental-specific subpath (`/dental/dental-files/records-release.ashx`). A patient navigating the primary medical records page (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records) would find form-1.pdf instead.

This form would be findable primarily by dental patients who navigate the dental section of the site or who search specifically for dental records release. It is less discoverable than the main form and may create confusion about which form to use for dental records, especially since the main form now also covers dental.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size**: 486,083 bytes (486 KB) — relatively large for a single-page form
- **Page count**: 1
- **Text layer**: Present (`has_text_layer: true`) — the document is not a scanned image
- **Fillable fields**: **0** — despite having a text layer, the form has no interactive/fillable PDF fields. Patients must print and handwrite entries.
- **Font count**: 35 — unusually high for a one-page form, suggesting complex formatting or design elements
- **Embedded images**: 1 (likely a logo or header graphic)
- **Image-only scan**: No

The lack of fillable fields is a notable technical limitation. The main form (form-1.pdf) also has zero fillable fields, so this is consistent across the organization, but it means patients cannot complete the form digitally. The 35-font count for a single page is abnormally high and may indicate the form was produced or converted through a design tool that embedded many font variants.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

### Header and Routing
The form opens with clear submission instructions at the top:
- "Fax completed form to: 843-792-7009"
- "Email completed form to: cdmimages@musc.edu"

This is helpful — the patient immediately knows where to send the form. However, these dental-specific contact details differ from both the current dental contacts listed on form-1 (cdm-roi-auth@musc.edu, fax 843-792-5460 or 843-876-8055), creating potential confusion about which fax/email is correct.

### Patient Identification
Fields for: Patient Name, Date of Birth, Email Address, Phone #, Health Record #. No field for SSN (unlike form-2.pdf which asks for "Last 4 digits of SSN") — this is a positive design choice for a dental-specific form.

### Release Direction
The form uses a combined "Release Records To / Obtain From" label with the parenthetical "(Where do you want the information sent? OR Who may receive the information?)" — this is somewhat confusing as it conflates two directions (sending records out vs. receiving records in) in a single field. The main form (form-1) separates these into two distinct fields ("Release Records From" and "Release Records To").

### Record Types
The dental-specific record types include:
- Entire Medical Record
- Orthodontic treatment notes (Including orthodontic-related photos and x-rays)
- Radiology Images / DVD (NOT Included in Entire Record)
- Periodontic Charting
- Billing/Financial Statements
- Treatment Progress / Visit Notes
- Other

This is a reasonable set of dental-specific options not available on the general form.

### Purpose of Release
Options: Continuing Care, Disability, Legal, Patient Request, School, Military, Insurance, Other — standard set matching the other MUSC forms.

### Release Method
Options: Fax (for healthcare providers/organizations as permitted), DVD/CD, Email, Mail, Other. Notably **missing**: MyChart and Encrypted Email options that appear on the newer form-1.

### Authorization Language
The legal disclosure section is substantial and covers:
- Sensitive information notice (psychiatric/psychological care, sexual assault, drug abuse, HIV/AIDS, alcohol abuse)
- Right to revoke in writing, directed to "Dental Health Information Services Department (Dental Records)"
- One-year expiration
- Voluntary nature of authorization
- Reference to 45 CFR §164.524
- Re-disclosure risk warning
- Copy of authorization promise

The statement "This form must be COMPLETED in its entirety in order to be considered valid" appears in bold-style emphasis. While this is a common form convention, it's worth noting as potentially intimidating.

### Footer Contact Information
"To contact Dental Health Information Services (Dental Records) in writing, the address is: College of Dental Medicine / Attention Records / MSC 507 / Charleston, South Carolina 29425-3490. The phone number is: (843) 876-7645 option 4."

This address (MSC 507) differs from the address on form-1 for dental records (3 South Park Circle / Bldg. 3 / Suite 103), suggesting the department may have relocated between the 5/19 version date and the 10/2023 revision of form-1.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Strengths:**
- Clear submission instructions (fax and email) at the top
- Dental-specific record categories are tailored to what dental patients actually need
- Does not require SSN
- States "I do not need to sign this form to receive treatment" — reassuring
- Mentions the right to review/copy information under 45 CFR §164.524
- One-year expiration provides a reasonable time-limited scope

**Weaknesses:**
- Not fillable digitally — requires printing, handwriting, and then faxing/emailing (scanning first)
- The "Release Records To / Obtain From" combined field is confusing
- "A copy of my identification will be made and attached to this authorization" — this implies in-person presentation for ID copying, which is a barrier for remote submission. It's ambiguous whether emailing/faxing a copy of ID would suffice.
- Fee language is vague: "I understand that fees for copies of medical records/Images and postage fees may be charged as provided by S.C. Law" — no fee schedule or estimate is provided
- Requires a witness signature, which is a burden for patients completing the form at home
- The 30-day processing note is stated parenthetically at the bottom: "(NOTE: HIPAA LAW ALLOWS 30 DAYS from receipt for processing.)" — while factually accurate for third-party requests, this may mislead patients requesting their own records (HIPAA allows 30 days for patient access requests under §164.524, but this form doesn't clearly distinguish patient access from third-party release)

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Fees**: References "S.C. Law" for fee authority but provides no specifics. For patient access requests, HIPAA limits fees to a reasonable, cost-based fee. The form does not distinguish between patient access fees and third-party release fees.
- **Processing time**: States 30 days, which aligns with HIPAA's maximum for access requests. However, HIPAA requires this to be the outer bound, not the norm — the form presents it as the standard expectation.
- **ID requirement**: "A copy of my identification will be made and attached to this authorization" — HIPAA allows verification of identity but does not require a photo ID copy to be attached. This may exceed HIPAA's verification requirements.
- **Witness requirement**: The form includes a "Witness Signature" field. HIPAA does not require a witness for authorization forms. This adds friction, particularly for patients submitting remotely.
- **Revocation**: Properly notes the right to revoke in writing. However, directing revocation to the "Dental Health Information Services Department (Dental Records)" specifically could be interpreted as requiring in-person or mail delivery.
- **Sensitive information**: The blanket inclusion statement ("this information may include reference to psychiatric / psychological care, sexual assault, drug abuse, results of tests for all infectious diseases including HIV / AIDS and / or alcohol abuse") is appropriate for an authorization form, though 42 CFR Part 2 protections for substance use disorder records require separate consent — this form does not address Part 2 with the specificity that form-1 does.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Witness signature required**: The form includes a "Witness Signature" line with no indication it is optional. HIPAA does not require witness signatures on authorization forms, and this creates a meaningful barrier for patients completing the form at home or remotely. A patient who cannot find a witness may be unable to submit the form.
- **ID copy requirement as stated implies in-person visit**: "A copy of my identification will be made and attached to this authorization" uses passive voice suggesting the provider will make the copy, implying the patient must present in person. This conflicts with the fax/email submission options listed at the top.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Conflicting contact information**: The fax number on this form (843-792-7009) and email (cdmimages@musc.edu) differ from the dental records contacts listed on the current form-1 (fax 843-792-5460 or 843-876-8055, email cdm-roi-auth@musc.edu). A patient could fax to a number that may no longer be monitored, potentially losing their request.
- **"Release Records To / Obtain From" conflation**: The single combined field for both sending and receiving records, with the parenthetical "Where do you want the information sent? OR Who may receive the information?", is ambiguous about the direction of information flow and whether MUSC is the sender or receiver.
- **Superseded form still accessible**: This Version 9 (5/19) form appears to have been replaced by form-1 (Rev. 10/2023), which now covers dental records. The continued availability of this older form with different contact information could lead patients to use outdated submission pathways.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Likely outdated address**: The footer lists the dental records address as "College of Dental Medicine / Attention Records / MSC 507 / Charleston, South Carolina 29425-3490," while the current form-1 lists dental records at "3 South Park Circle / Bldg. 3 / Suite 103 / Charleston, SC 29407." At least one of these is incorrect or outdated.
- **Revision footer inconsistency**: The form header says "Version Date: 5/19" but the footer says "OTE 700078 Rev. 10/20" — suggesting a revision occurred in October 2020 that wasn't reflected in the header version date.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Dental-specific record categories**: Including options like "Orthodontic treatment notes (Including orthodontic-related photos and x-rays)" and "Periodontic Charting" demonstrates thoughtful tailoring to what dental patients actually need, rather than forcing them to use generic medical record categories.
- **Email submission option**: Listing an email address for form submission (cdmimages@musc.edu) at the top of the form provides a low-barrier digital pathway, even though the form itself isn't fillable.
