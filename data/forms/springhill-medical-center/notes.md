## Additional Observations

- The medical records page also features a **Zoho-based online ROI request portal** at `https://creatorapp.zohopublic.com/medrecsmanagement/medrecs-roi/...` for submitting electronic requests. This is a third-party ROI management service (MedRecs Management).
- The ROI form (form-1.pdf) dates from 2011 based on the filename and appears to be a flat PDF (no fillable fields based on the text extraction showing underscores for fill-in areas).
- The form offers multiple delivery methods including patient portal and email, which is notable for a 2011-era form.
- HIM fax number listed on the website: 251.410.4014.
- The form still references the older name "Springhill Memorial Hospital."

## Difficulties
- None — the form was easily findable via web search and directly linked from the organization's website.
- Retrieval difficulty: **easy**
