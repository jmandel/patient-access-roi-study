# Evaluation: Springhill Medical Center — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is **not an ROI form**. It is an ONC (Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT) infographic titled **"GET IT. CHECK IT. USE IT."** — a general patient education resource about health information rights under HIPAA. The document is branded by HealthIT.gov, not by Springhill Medical Center, and contains no organization-specific content whatsoever.

The file was downloaded from Springhill's website (`/sites/default/files/YourHealthInformationYourRights_Infographic-Web.pdf`) where it is linked from their Medical Records page. It appears to serve as supplementary educational material alongside the actual ROI form (form-1.pdf, the "REQUEST FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION" form). The two documents serve entirely different purposes: form-1 is the actionable authorization form, while form-2 is an awareness infographic.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this infographic was linked from the Medical Records page at `https://springhillmedicalcenter.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`. It was described as "a downloadable infographic about patient health information rights." The URL path (`YourHealthInformationYourRights_Infographic-Web.pdf`) is descriptive enough to indicate its purpose before downloading.

However, the fact that this is hosted on Springhill's website without any organizational customization could create confusion — a patient might download this thinking it is the authorization form or contains organization-specific instructions, only to find it is a generic federal resource.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size:** 5,038,839 bytes (~4.8 MB) — extremely large for a single-page document. This is over 60× larger than the actual ROI form (form-1.pdf at 74 KB).
- **Pages:** 1
- **Text layer:** Present — text is extractable (1,636 characters).
- **Fillable fields:** 0 (appropriate — this is not a form).
- **Fonts:** 5
- **Embedded images:** 18 — explains the large file size. This is a graphics-heavy infographic.
- **Image-only scan:** No.

The document functions as a digital artifact — it has a text layer and was designed digitally (not scanned). However, the nearly 5 MB file size is disproportionate for a single page of content. The 18 embedded images (icons, illustrations, decorative elements typical of infographics) drive the bloat. On slow connections or mobile devices, this could be a significant download burden.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The infographic uses a visually engaging design with statistics, a patient scenario (Hannah, a 50-year-old with Type 2 Diabetes), and three thematic sections:

- **"DID YOU KNOW?"** — Statistics about patient record access: "8 in 10 individuals who have viewed their medical record online considered the information useful," "27% of individuals were unaware or didn't believe they had a right to an electronic copy," and "41% of Americans have never even seen their health information."
- **"KNOW YOUR RIGHTS"** — Uses the Hannah scenario to explain the right to access health records.
- **"SEND YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION TO A THIRD PARTY"** / **"PROTECT YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION"** — Advice about sharing and safeguarding records.

The language is plain and accessible. It uses short sentences, large statistics, and a narrative scenario to make concepts approachable. As an infographic, it prioritizes visual communication over dense text.

However, the content is entirely generic — it does not tell a Springhill patient *how* to request their records, *where* to submit a form, or *what* to expect from this specific organization.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This document promotes patient awareness of health information rights, which is a positive signal — it shows the organization at least acknowledges patient access rights. However:

- It provides **no actionable instructions** for requesting records from Springhill.
- It contains **no organization-specific contact information**, mailing address, or process description.
- It does not reference Springhill's ROI form, Zoho request portal, or HIM department.
- The links at the bottom (`WWW.HEALTHIT.GOV/ACCESS` and `www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access`) point to federal resources, not Springhill's own processes.

A patient who receives only this document would know they *have* the right to their records but would have no idea how to exercise that right at Springhill Medical Center specifically.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

This document imposes no requirements or barriers — it is purely informational. It correctly states that "HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) gives us the right to access our health information" and that patients can "see and get a copy of her health information."

The document does include appropriate privacy cautions: "Your provider is no longer responsible for the security of your health information after it is sent to a third party" and "Be careful when sending your health information to a mobile application or other third party." These are accurate statements, though in some contexts such language could discourage patients from exercising their access rights.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Unclear relationship to actual ROI process:** A patient encountering this infographic on Springhill's Medical Records page might reasonably expect it to contain instructions for requesting records. Instead, it is a generic federal resource with no connection to Springhill's specific processes. The document's placement on the organization's website without any organizational wrapper, cover note, or link to the actual form could leave patients confused about next steps.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Potentially outdated statistics and broken source links:** The infographic cites two HealthIT.gov sources — `https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/briefs/oncdatabrief30_accesstrends_.pdf` and a HealthIT.gov buzz-blog post. These ONC data briefs and blog posts may no longer be available at these URLs, and the statistics themselves (from what appears to be a mid-2010s publication) may be outdated. The infographic carries no date or version indicator.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Proactive patient education:** While not an ROI form, the fact that Springhill hosts and links to patient rights educational material on their Medical Records page is a positive signal. Many organizations provide only the bare authorization form with no context about *why* patients should exercise their access rights. The "GET IT. CHECK IT. USE IT." messaging is encouraging, even if the execution (a generic federal infographic rather than a customized resource) is limited.
