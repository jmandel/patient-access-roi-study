## Additional Notes

- The medical records page (https://www.wth.org/request-medical-records/) also links to Spanish versions of form-2 and form-3, and an online request portal via ScanStat (https://www.scanstat.com/patient-record-request/) for hospital records only.
- West Tennessee Healthcare distinguishes between patient access (form-3) and third-party release (form-2), which is a good practice.
- Form-1 appears to be an older/separate form specific to the medical group clinics.
- All three forms have extractable text layers (not image-only scans).
- Retrieval difficulty: **easy** — forms were directly linked from a clearly labeled medical records page.
