# UPMC Presbyterian — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `UPMC "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links on UPMC's DAM (Digital Asset Management) CDN.
2. **Web search** for `UPMC "medical records" "release form" PDF download` — confirmed same URLs, plus found the UPMC medical records landing page.
3. **Navigated UPMC medical records page** (`https://www.upmc.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`) — found the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page with the same form link plus a form completion guide PDF.
4. **Checked UPMC Presbyterian-specific page** (`https://www.upmc.com/locations/hospitals/presbyterian/patients-visitors/medical-records`) — confirmed the main ROI form is the system-wide UPMC form, plus found a separate "form completion guide" PDF.

## Difficulties

- None. UPMC makes their ROI form readily available. The form is linked from the system-wide medical records page and from each hospital's individual page.
- UPMC Presbyterian uses the same system-wide ROI form as other UPMC hospitals. It is not a facility-specific form.
- There is also an "In Home" version for UPMC In Home Urgent Care Plus / Home Healthcare, which is a separate form.
