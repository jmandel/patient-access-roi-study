## Result

**No ROI / Authorization for Medical Records form was found online.**

Schweiger Dermatology Group does not publish a downloadable ROI or medical records release form on their public website. All search strategies (web searches, website navigation, sitemap analysis, direct URL guessing) confirmed this finding.

The organization directs patients to:
1. **Patient Portal** (https://schweigerderm.ema.md/ema/PatientLogin.action) — login required
2. **Phone**: 844-DERM-DOC or 212-283-3000
3. **Text**: (646) 558-6696

No Notice of Privacy Practices document was found published on the website either, though the privacy policy mentions that HIPAA-covered information is handled under a separate policy.

## Downloaded Forms
None — no forms were available for download.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The organization has a large web presence (hundreds of location pages, many providers) but very limited patient resources/forms available publicly
- Google search was blocked (CAPTCHA) when attempted through the browser
- No third-party medical records release vendor (MediCopy, Ciox, etc.) appears to be used
- Forms appear to be exclusively available through the patient portal (behind login) or by contacting the office directly
