# Arizona Community Physicians — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `"Arizona Community Physicians" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — didn't return direct links but confirmed forms exist.
2. **Web search for medical records release**: Searched `"Arizona Community Physicians" "medical records" "release form" Tucson` — returned direct URLs to multiple forms on azacp.com.
3. **Site-specific search**: `site:azacp.com authorization release medical records` — returned detailed results with multiple form URLs and descriptions.
4. **Direct website navigation**: Visited https://www.azacp.com/forms/ to confirm all available forms and get correct URLs.

**What worked best**: The second and third web searches returned direct PDF URLs. The forms page at azacp.com/forms/ was easily accessible (linked from main nav as "Patient Forms") and listed all forms clearly.

## Downloaded Forms

| File | Source URL | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| form-1.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Medical_Records_Release_Form.pdf | **General Authorization to Release Medical Information** — Standard ACP ROI form. Includes patient info, release from/to fields, purpose checkboxes, record type selection (general vs. protected records like HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse). Offers paper, disc (PDF), and email delivery options. 1-year expiration (60 days for drug/alcohol records). |
| form-2.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/AFP-Records-Release.pdf | **Authorization to Disclose Medical Information (Associates in Family Practice)** — Pre-filled variant of the ROI form with "Associates in Family Practice" (a specific ACP practice location at 6565 E. Carondelet Dr, Tucson) as the receiving party. Same structure as form-1. |
| form-3.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Adult-Release-of-Information-Form-116.pdf | **Adult Release of Information Form** — Designates who can access patient's medical records (appointments, billing, test results). Lists authorized persons by name/relationship. Includes voicemail permission and "do not release" section. More of a standing consent/access designation than a one-time records request. |

| form-7.pdf | https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/HIPAA-Amendment-Request.pdf | **HIPAA Amendment Request Form** — For patients to request corrections to their medical records. Not an ROI form but related to HIPAA patient rights. |

## Additional Notes

- The forms page also links to a **"Medical Records Electronic Self Request"** via https://www.swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html — an online wizard for electronic records requests (not a downloadable PDF).
- All forms are flat PDFs (no fillable fields visible) with text layers — they appear designed for printing and hand-filling.
- form-1.pdf is the primary general-purpose ROI form. form-2.pdf is a practice-specific variant. form-3.pdf and form-5.pdf are standing access designation forms rather than one-time release authorizations.
- No difficulties encountered — forms were easy to find and download directly.
- An initial attempt to download a minor release form from a different URL (tucsoncentralpediatrics.com, returned by search) yielded an HTML page instead of a PDF; the correct URL was found on the azacp.com forms page.
