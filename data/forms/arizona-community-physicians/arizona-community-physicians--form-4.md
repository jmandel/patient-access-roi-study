# Evaluation: Arizona Community Physicians — form-4.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **specialty imaging authorization form** — "Authorization to Release Medical Information" — specific to ACP's two radiology/imaging centers: ACP Northwest Imaging (2191 W Orange Grove Rd.) and ACP Eastside Imaging (5515 East 5th Street), both in Tucson. It is labeled "Form 100-Authorization to Release Medical Records (Imaging specific)" and was revised 7/11/2025.

Within ACP's suite of seven downloaded forms, this is a narrower variant of the general ROI form (form-1). While form-1 handles general medical records with open "released from" fields, form-4 pre-populates the releasing facilities as the two imaging centers and tailors the record-type options to imaging studies (reports and digital images). Form-2 is another variant of form-1 pre-filled for a specific practice (Associates in Family Practice). Forms 3 and 5 are standing access designations (adult and minor), form-6 is a Spanish translation of form-5, and form-7 is a HIPAA amendment request.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, all forms were found via the ACP website's "Patient Forms" page (https://www.azacp.com/forms/), linked from the main navigation. The form URL (https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Records-Release-Imaging.pdf) has a descriptive filename (`Records-Release-Imaging.pdf`), making it identifiable without opening. Multiple web search strategies succeeded in locating the forms page. The notes describe "no difficulties encountered" — a straightforward discovery process. However, there is no indication that the forms page distinguishes between patient-self-request forms and third-party release forms, so a patient would need to read each form to determine which applies.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size**: 125,349 bytes (~122 KB) for a single page — reasonable, likely containing one embedded image (logo).
- **Text layer**: Present and complete. The full text extracts cleanly at 2,622 characters with no OCR artifacts or garbled content.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The metadata confirms `fillable_field_count: 0`. The form uses printed underscores for blank lines (e.g., `Patient Name_______________________________`), meaning patients must print it and fill by hand.
- **Font count**: 2 fonts — minimal, suggesting simple typography.
- **Digital-first design**: This is clearly a print-oriented form. No interactive elements, no digital submission pathway. The form does offer email as a delivery method for results but not as a submission method for the authorization itself.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page — appropriately concise for a focused imaging records request.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow:
1. Patient Information (name, former name, account #, phone, DOB, email)
2. Information to be Released From (pre-printed imaging center addresses/phone numbers)
3. Information to be Released To (recipient details)
4. Requested Format and Delivery Method
5. Type of Information to be Released (specific studies vs. general imaging release)
6. Authorization language and signature block
7. Office-use-only tracking fields at the bottom

**Clarity**: Language is generally plain and direct. The authorization statement is concise: "I hereby authorize the release of the above indicated medical information. I understand authorizing the disclosure of the information identified above is voluntary. I need not sign this form to ensure healthcare treatment." This is significantly shorter and clearer than form-2's more legalistic equivalent.

**Layout observations**: The form packs a reasonable amount of content onto one page. The format/delivery section is somewhat compact — it nests delivery method options under format options ("Paper (Reports Only)" vs. "Digital Images (Includes Reports and Images)") with delivery methods listed as sub-options. There appear to be checkboxes for selection. The "Specific images and reports" section provides four numbered lines with date fields, which is practical for specifying individual studies.

**Notable absence of fee disclosure**: Unlike form-1, which states "The standard charge for copying medical records is $6.50 for a disc and $0.07 per page for paper," form-4 makes no mention of fees at all.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is structured as a general authorization to release imaging records to any specified recipient. The "Information to be Released To" section asks for "Name of Physician/Organization/Individual," suggesting it's intended for transfers to other providers. There is no specific pathway or language for a patient requesting their own imaging records. However, a patient could fill in their own name as the recipient.

**Scope options**: Good granularity. Patients can choose:
- Specific studies (up to 4 individual exams with dates)
- General imaging release ("All study images and reports") with a treatment date range
- The general release defaults to one year: "This will be limited to 1 year of information unless otherwise indicated"

**Format options**: Two options are offered:
- "Paper (Reports Only)" — only written reports, no images
- "Digital Images (Includes Reports and Images)" — comprehensive, includes both

**Delivery options**: Four methods available — mail, pickup at the imaging center, email, and fax. Email and pickup are only listed under the digital images option. The paper option only lists mail. This is a reasonable approach for imaging, where digital image files require electronic delivery.

**Right of Access language**: No reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or patient rights. The form states "I need not sign this form to ensure healthcare treatment," which addresses conditioning of treatment, but doesn't inform patients of their right of access to their own records.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Purpose field**: Notably absent. Unlike form-1 (which has "PURPOSE FOR THIS REQUEST" with checkboxes including "At request of Patient") and form-2 (which has a detailed purpose section), form-4 does not ask the patient why they want their records. This is arguably a positive for patient access — HIPAA does not require patients to state a reason.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration**: "THIS AUTHORIZATION WILL AUTOMATICALLY EXPIRE AFTER ONE YEAR from the date of signing." This is identical to form-1's general expiration but notably does not include form-1's shorter 60-day window for drug/alcohol records — appropriate since imaging records wouldn't typically contain such information.

**Revocation**: The form states "The undersigned may revoke this authorization at any time by providing written notice of revocation." This is appropriate and HIPAA-compliant.

**No notarization or witness requirement**: The form only requires the patient's or legal representative's signature and date — no notary, no witness.

**No mention of fees**: The absence of fee language could be interpreted either positively (no upfront cost barrier) or as an omission that may surprise patients later.

**No submission instructions**: The form does not specify how or where to submit the completed authorization (mail, fax, in-person at the imaging center). Patients would presumably need to deliver it to one of the two listed imaging centers, but this is unstated.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no guidance on how to submit the completed authorization — no mailing address, fax number, or email for returning the form itself. Patients must infer they should contact or visit one of the two imaging centers. This contrasts with form-7 (amendment request), which explicitly lists mail, fax, and in-person delivery options with addresses.
- **Delivery method alignment is unclear**: The delivery methods (mail, pickup, email, fax) appear to be listed under format categories but the visual hierarchy in the extracted text makes it ambiguous whether "Email to above email" and "Fax to above number" are available for paper reports as well, or only for digital images.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **No purpose-of-request field**: Unlike forms 1 and 2, this form does not ask patients to justify why they want their records. HIPAA does not require a reason for patient access requests, so omitting this field reduces friction.
- **Digital image delivery options**: Offering email delivery and in-person pickup of digital images is practical and patient-friendly for radiology records, which are large and best viewed digitally.
- **Specific study selection**: The four-line itemization section lets patients request exactly the imaging studies they need, which is useful when patients know which exams they want (e.g., a specific MRI for a second opinion).
- **Concise authorization language**: The consent text is brief and readable — three sentences that cover voluntariness, treatment non-conditioning, and authorization. This is clearer than many ROI forms.
