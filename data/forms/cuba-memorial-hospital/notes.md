## Search Strategies

### 1. Web search for Cuba Memorial Hospital ROI form (unsuccessful)
- Searched for `"Cuba Memorial Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF`
- Searched for `site:cubamemorialhospital.com authorization release medical records`
- Searched for `"Cuba Memorial Hospital" "release of information" OR "medical records request" form filetype:pdf`
- **Result**: No direct PDF form found. Web search results consistently indicated no downloadable form on their website.

### 2. Cuba Memorial Hospital website navigation (no form found)
- Navigated to https://www.cubamemorialhospital.com
- Checked the site map page — no medical records or forms page listed
- Checked the HIPAA Notice page — mentions right to access records but no downloadable form
- The Patient Portal page (YourHEALTH) provides electronic access to records but no ROI form
- **Result**: The Cuba Memorial Hospital website does not publish an ROI/authorization form. It's a small site focused on services, with no dedicated medical records or patient forms section.

### 3. Parent organization BRMC-OGH site (successful)
- Cuba Memorial Hospital's footer links to "BRMC-OGH Site" at https://www.brmc-ogh.org/
- The BRMC-OGH homepage banner mentions "For medical records, visit our medical records page"
- Navigated to https://www.brmc-ogh.org/visitors/medical-records/
- **Found two ROI forms** under "Information Release Forms" heading:
  - "Release of information form – OGH (pdf)" — Olean General Hospital form
  - "Release of information form – BRMC (pdf)" — Bradford Regional Medical Center form
- Both hosted on Tiny Cloud drive (CMS file hosting)

### 4. Kaleida Health parent search (not needed)
- Searched for Kaleida Health-level forms but found none beyond what BRMC-OGH provided
- The BRMC-OGH site forms appear to be the standard forms used across the Upper Allegheny Health System

- **Org on form**: Olean General Hospital, Upper Allegheny Health System, 515 Main Street, Olean, NY 14760
- **Pages**: 2
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Form number**: 3208105, Revised 01/20/2017
- **Notes**: This is the most relevant form for Cuba Memorial Hospital since both are part of UAHS and located in New York. The form includes checkboxes for specific record types, sections for patient access (inspection/copies), 90-day expiration, and specially protected information consent (HIV, mental health, substance abuse). Requires photo ID for pickup.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/fma0ckgi8l71unwv372o9bkc28qzcn65s72m80cndsw3awok/61c90625-dd5b-4e4e-81c2-70e000fb6a31
- **Found on page**: https://www.brmc-ogh.org/visitors/medical-records/
- **Link text**: "Release of information form – BRMC (pdf)"
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization form — same title as form-1
- **Org on form**: Bradford Regional Medical Center, Bradford, PA 16701
- **Pages**: 2
- **Has text layer**: Yes
- **Form number**: 3004200, Revised 01/20/2017
- **Notes**: Nearly identical to form-1 but for BRMC in Pennsylvania. The disclosing organization field is blank (not pre-filled) unlike the OGH version. Included since BRMC is part of the same system.

## Difficulties Encountered
- Cuba Memorial Hospital does not publish any ROI or authorization forms on its own website
- The hospital website is relatively small with no dedicated patient forms or medical records section
- The connection to the BRMC-OGH system (and thus to downloadable forms) was found through a footer link on the Cuba Memorial Hospital website
- Neither form specifically mentions Cuba Memorial Hospital — they are system-level forms for OGH and BRMC
- The Cuba Memorial Hospital website directs patients to the YourHEALTH patient portal for health record access, but provides no downloadable authorization forms

## Retrieval Difficulty: Moderate
The form is not on Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website. It required recognizing the affiliation with the BRMC-OGH system via a footer link, navigating to the parent organization's medical records page, and inferring that the OGH form would be the applicable one for a UAHS facility in New York.
