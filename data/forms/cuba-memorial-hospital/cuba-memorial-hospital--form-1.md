# Evaluation: Cuba Memorial Hospital — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page "AUTHORIZATION FOR PATIENT ACCESS AND/OR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION" form (Form #3208105, revised 01/20/2017). It is branded for **Olean General Hospital** (515 Main Street, Olean, NY 14760) under the Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) — not Cuba Memorial Hospital directly. Cuba Memorial Hospital is part of UAHS but does not publish its own ROI form; this OGH form was the closest available match, found on the affiliated BRMC-OGH website.

A second form (form-2.pdf, Form #3004200) is nearly identical but branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Neither form mentions Cuba Memorial Hospital by name. This form is the more relevant of the two for Cuba Memorial since both OGH and Cuba Memorial are UAHS facilities located in New York.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Poor.** Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website (cubamemorialhospital.com) has no ROI form, no medical records page, and no patient forms section. Multiple search strategies — including site-specific searches, direct site navigation, and sitemap review — failed to locate a form.

The form was ultimately found by following a footer link from the Cuba Memorial site to the affiliated BRMC-OGH site (brmc-ogh.org), then navigating to the medical records page at `/visitors/medical-records/`. The link text reads "Release of information form – OGH (pdf)" — the form is hosted on a Tiny Cloud drive (CMS file hosting), producing a non-descriptive URL: `https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/fma0ckgi8l71unwv372o9bkc28qzcn65s72m80cndsw3awok/8e375fa6-67ee-4521-b781-1af0d5819c77`.

A patient seeking records from Cuba Memorial Hospital would need to: (1) recognize the BRMC-OGH footer link as relevant, (2) navigate to the medical records page on that separate site, and (3) infer that the "OGH" form applies to their Cuba Memorial Hospital records. This is a multi-step, non-obvious process.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — the PDF has extractable text (3,549 characters), not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero.** The metadata reports `fillable_field_count: 0` and no fillable field names. Despite having a text layer, the form has no interactive fields. It must be printed and filled by hand, or filled using a general PDF annotation tool.
- **File size**: 123,982 bytes (~124 KB) for 2 pages with 1 embedded image (likely a logo) — reasonable.
- **Font count**: 10 fonts used, suggesting reasonable typographic variation for headings, body, and emphasis.
- **Digital design**: This is a digitally-produced document (not a scan), but it is designed as a print-first form with no digital fill capabilities. The instruction "(Read Entire Document before Signing)" and the "Patient Identification Sticker" placeholder on page 1 confirm its orientation toward in-person, paper-based processing.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure**: The form uses a numbered section format (1–7) across two pages:
1. Authorization statement
2. Disclosing organization (pre-filled as OGH)
3. Record type checklist with date ranges
4. Recipient information + patient access options (inspection vs. copies)
5. Patient rights statements (a–e)
6. Expiration provision
7. Specially protected information consent (HIV, mental health, substance abuse)

**Record type options**: The form offers 11 specific record types: Discharge Summary, History/Physical, Operative Reports, Cardiac Cath Reports, Caregiver Designation (Aftercare Instructions), Clinic Notes, Immunization Records, Lab Results, X-ray Reports, Emergency Department, Physical Therapy — plus an "Other" catch-all. Each has a date range field.

**Clarity**: The language is moderately legalistic. Section 5's patient rights statements use reasonably clear language, though some phrasing is awkward: "but in do, it will not apply" (section 5c) appears to be a typo for "but if I do." The form instructs patients to "Read Entire Document before Signing" at the top.

**Layout**: The form is compact across 2 pages. Section 4 combines recipient designation with patient access options (inspection vs. copies) in a somewhat cluttered arrangement. The "- - Continued on back -" notice appears at the bottom of page 1.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Dual-purpose design**: The form title — "AUTHORIZATION FOR PATIENT ACCESS AND/OR USE AND DISCLOSURE" — signals it covers both patient access and third-party release. Section 4 includes explicit patient access options: "I am interested in ☐ inspection or ☐ copies of my medical record" and a separate authorization line: "I authorize [name] to access my medical/hospital records for inspection and/or copies." This is a positive feature — the form explicitly contemplates patients requesting their own records.

**Scope options**: Patients can select specific record types and date ranges, which is helpful. However, there is no option for "all records" or "complete medical record" — patients must check individual categories.

**Delivery format**: No mention of electronic delivery options. The form only offers "inspection" or "copies" (implying paper). The statement "Photo ID is required for records to be picked up" implies in-person pickup is the expected (and possibly only) delivery method.

**No fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) mentions "a reasonable copy fee" but provides no specifics about cost.

**No mention of patient rights under HIPAA § 164.524**, timelines for response, or electronic health information export.

**Expiration**: Section 6 states the authorization "will expire 90 days from the date of signature unless you request an earlier date or event." A 90-day expiration is short but not unreasonable for an authorization form; however, for a patient access request, an expiration is arguably unnecessary since patients have an ongoing right to their records.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Witness requirement**: The form includes lines for "Witness" and "Witness/Interpreter (if needed)" with date and time fields. While not labeled as mandatory, the presence of a dedicated witness line with date/time could deter patients from completing the form without a witness present, which HIPAA does not require.
- **Photo ID for pickup**: "**Photo ID is required for records to be picked up.**" — bolded and emphatic. While identity verification is reasonable, this implies in-person pickup is the standard or only method.
- **90-day expiration**: A built-in 90-day expiration may be unnecessarily restrictive for patient access requests, where HIPAA grants an ongoing right.
- **Specially protected information**: Section 7 requires separate consent checkboxes for HIV/AIDS, psychiatric/mental health, and substance abuse information — consistent with New York State law and 42 CFR Part 2.
- **"Staff Use Only" section**: Includes "Unable to release ____ due to ____" — suggesting denials are documented, though no appeal process is mentioned.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **No form exists for Cuba Memorial Hospital itself.** A patient of this hospital cannot find an ROI form on the hospital's own website. They must discover an affiliated organization's form through a non-obvious pathway, then use a form branded for a different hospital (Olean General). This creates a significant access barrier.
- **In-person pickup implied as only option.** The bolded statement "**Photo ID is required for records to be picked up**" combined with no mention of mail, fax, or electronic delivery suggests patients must retrieve records in person — potentially at OGH in Olean (30+ miles from Cuba, NY), not at Cuba Memorial itself.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Which facility does this form apply to?** The form is pre-filled with "Olean General Hospital" as the disclosing organization. It is unclear whether a Cuba Memorial Hospital patient should use this form as-is or modify the disclosing entity. No instructions address cross-facility use within UAHS.
- **Witness lines without clarity on requirement.** The form provides dedicated witness signature lines but doesn't indicate whether a witness is required or optional, which may confuse or deter patients.
- **"Reasonable copy fee" undefined.** Section 5(e) references a fee without specifying amounts or pointing to a fee schedule.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Typo in section 5(c)**: "I may revoke this authorization at any time in writing, but **in do**, it will not apply..." — should read "but **if I do**."
- **Outdated form revision date**: Revised 01/20/2017 — nearly 9 years old. No updates to reflect the 21st Century Cures Act, Information Blocking rules, or TEFCA developments.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Explicit patient access pathway.** The form includes dedicated checkboxes for "inspection" and "copies" with a clear authorization line for patient self-access, rather than solely focusing on third-party release. This dual-purpose design is relatively uncommon and shows awareness of patient access as a distinct use case.
- **Granular record type selection.** Eleven specific record categories with individual date ranges give patients meaningful control over what they request.
