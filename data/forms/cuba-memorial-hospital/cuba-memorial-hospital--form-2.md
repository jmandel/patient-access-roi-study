# Evaluation: Cuba Memorial Hospital — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page "AUTHORIZATION FOR PATIENT ACCESS AND/OR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION" form (Form #3004200, revised 01/20/2017, logo updated 07/25/18). It is branded for **Bradford Regional Medical Center** (Bradford, PA 16701) — not Cuba Memorial Hospital. The footer reads "Bradford Regional Medical Center – Bradford, PA 16701." BRMC is part of the same Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) as Cuba Memorial Hospital, but is located in a different state (Pennsylvania vs. New York).

This form is the second of two ROI forms found for Cuba Memorial Hospital, both hosted on the affiliated BRMC-OGH website. Form-1 (Form #3208105) is the Olean General Hospital variant — nearly identical in structure but pre-filled with OGH as the disclosing organization and located in New York. This BRMC form is less relevant to Cuba Memorial patients because: (1) it is branded for a facility in a different state, and (2) Cuba Memorial and OGH share the same New York jurisdiction. However, unlike form-1, the disclosing organization field in form-2 is **blank** (section 2 contains only "Name:" and "Address:" with empty lines), which could theoretically make it more adaptable if a patient writes in "Cuba Memorial Hospital."

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Poor.** This form is not available on Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website. The hospital's site (cubamemorialhospital.com) has no ROI form, no medical records page, and no patient forms section. The form was found by following a footer link from Cuba Memorial's site to the BRMC-OGH site (brmc-ogh.org), then navigating to `/visitors/medical-records/`, where it appears under the link text "Release of information form – BRMC (pdf)."

The hosted URL is a non-descriptive Tiny Cloud CMS link: `https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/fma0ckgi8l71unwv372o9bkc28qzcn65s72m80cndsw3awok/61c90625-dd5b-4e4e-81c2-70e000fb6a31`. A patient at Cuba Memorial Hospital would need to: (1) find the BRMC-OGH footer link, (2) navigate to the medical records page on a different organization's website, and (3) determine which of two forms — one labeled "OGH" and one labeled "BRMC" — applies to them. There is no guidance suggesting either form is intended for Cuba Memorial patients, and the "BRMC" label actively suggests this form is for a Pennsylvania facility only.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — the PDF has extractable text (3,535 characters) and is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero.** The metadata reports `fillable_field_count: 0`. Despite being a digitally-produced document, it has no interactive form fields. Patients must print and hand-fill or use a generic PDF annotation tool.
- **File size**: 125,008 bytes (~125 KB) for 2 pages with 1 embedded image (likely a logo) — reasonable.
- **Font count**: 10 fonts used.
- **Digital design**: This is a print-oriented form. The "Patient Identification Sticker" placeholder on page 1 and the instruction "(Read Entire Document before Signing)" confirm an in-person, paper-based workflow. No electronic submission mechanism is referenced.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure**: The form uses a numbered section format (1–7) across two pages, identical to form-1:
1. Authorization statement
2. Disclosing organization (blank — not pre-filled, unlike the OGH form)
3. Record type checklist with date ranges — 11 specific categories: Discharge Summary, History/Physical, Operative Reports, Cardiac Cath Reports, Caregiver Designation (Aftercare Instructions), Clinic Notes, Immunization Records, Lab Results, X-ray Reports, Emergency Department, Physical Therapy, plus "Other"
4. Recipient information + patient access options (inspection vs. copies)
5. Patient rights statements (a–e)
6. Expiration provision (90-day default)
7. Specially protected information consent (HIV, mental health, substance abuse)

**Clarity**: Language is moderately legalistic but generally comprehensible. The same typo present in form-1 appears here: section 5(c) reads "but in do, it will not apply" instead of "but if I do." Section 5's patient rights statements (a–e) cover voluntary nature, no treatment impact, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, and right to copies for a fee.

**Layout**: Compact 2-page layout with a "- - Continued on back -" notice at page 1's bottom. Section 4 combines recipient designation with patient access options in a somewhat crowded arrangement. The form version metadata appears in a footer block: "Orig: prior to 2005 / Rvsd. 01/20/2017 / Logo: 07/25/18 / Form #: 3004200."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Dual-purpose design**: Like form-1, the title includes "PATIENT ACCESS AND/OR USE AND DISCLOSURE," and section 4 provides checkboxes: "I am interested in ☐ inspection or ☐ copies of my medical record," along with a separate line: "I authorize [name] to access my medical/hospital records for inspection and/or copies." This dual-purpose design acknowledges patient self-access as a valid use case.

**Scope options**: Patients can check specific record types with date ranges. However, there is no "all records" or "complete medical record" option — patients must individually select from the 11 categories or use the "Other" field.

**Delivery format**: No electronic delivery options are mentioned. The only delivery-related statement is the bolded "**Photo ID is required for records to be picked up.**" — implying in-person pickup. No mention of mail, fax, email, or patient portal delivery.

**Fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) states patients "may see and obtain a copy of the information described on this form for a reasonable copy fee" but provides no specific fee amounts, schedule, or reference to where fees are published.

**Rights information**: No mention of HIPAA § 164.524 patient access rights, required response timelines (30 days), or rights under the 21st Century Cures Act regarding electronic health information.

**Expiration**: Section 6 provides a 90-day default expiration, which is short. For patient access requests, this expiration is arguably unnecessary since HIPAA grants an ongoing right of access, not a time-limited one.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Wrong-jurisdiction form**: This BRMC form is branded for a Pennsylvania facility. Cuba Memorial Hospital is in New York. Pennsylvania and New York have different health privacy laws — for example, different rules around mental health records, minor consent, and substance abuse treatment records. Using a PA-branded form for a NY facility could create confusion about which state's privacy protections apply.
- **Witness line**: The form includes "Witness" and "Witness/Interpreter (if needed)" signature lines with date/time fields. HIPAA does not require a witness for authorization forms. The presence of these lines — particularly without a note that witnessing is optional — may deter patients from submitting without a witness present.
- **Photo ID for pickup**: The bolded requirement "**Photo ID is required for records to be picked up**" implies in-person pickup is the expected method. HIPAA requires covered entities to provide records in the form and format requested by the patient when readily producible.
- **Specially protected information**: Section 7 uses separate consent checkboxes for HIV/AIDS, psychiatric/mental health, and substance abuse — consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements. These are check-to-include rather than check-to-exclude, meaning patients must affirmatively authorize inclusion of these categories.
- **Staff Use Only**: Includes "Unable to release ____ due to ____" for documenting partial denials, though no appeal or complaint process is mentioned.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Cross-state form used for a New York facility.** This form is branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. A Cuba Memorial Hospital patient in New York has no facility-specific form available online and would need to use a form designed for a different state's regulatory environment. No instructions clarify whether or how this form should be used by Cuba Memorial patients.
- **In-person pickup as implied sole delivery method.** The bolded "**Photo ID is required for records to be picked up**" combined with no mention of mail, fax, or electronic delivery options suggests patients must retrieve records in person — potentially at a facility other than Cuba Memorial Hospital.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Blank disclosing organization field.** Section 2's "Name" and "Address" fields for the disclosing organization are empty. While this makes the form theoretically generic, it provides no guidance to patients about what to fill in — should they write "Cuba Memorial Hospital"? "Bradford Regional Medical Center"? "Upper Allegheny Health System"? The footer says "Bradford Regional Medical Center" but the header does not.
- **Witness requirement unclear.** The witness lines are present without any indication of whether they are mandatory or optional. A patient filling out the form at home would not know if an unwitnessed submission will be accepted.
- **"Reasonable copy fee" undefined.** No fee amounts or fee schedule reference is provided, leaving patients unable to estimate costs before submitting.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Typo in section 5(c)**: "I may revoke this authorization at any time in writing, but **in do**, it will not apply..." — should read "but **if I do**." This identical typo appears in both system forms, suggesting they share a common template that has never been corrected.
- **Form age**: Revised 01/20/2017 with a logo update in 07/25/2018 — nearly 9 years old with no substantive updates to reflect the 21st Century Cures Act (2016, with implementing rules in 2020-2021), Information Blocking regulations, or evolving patient access standards.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Blank disclosing entity field is a double-edged sword.** Unlike form-1 (pre-filled with "Olean General Hospital"), this form's blank section 2 at least does not force a Cuba Memorial patient to submit a form explicitly naming a different hospital as the disclosing entity. A savvy patient could write in "Cuba Memorial Hospital" — though no instructions suggest doing so.
- **Explicit patient access pathway.** The form includes dedicated checkboxes for "inspection" and "copies" of one's own medical record, treating patient self-access as a first-class use case alongside third-party disclosure.
