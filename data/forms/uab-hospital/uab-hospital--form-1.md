# UAB Hospital — form-1.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **"Patient Request for Own Medical Records"** form — a 2-page PDF specifically designed for patients requesting access to their own protected health information. The form opens with the statement: *"UAB Medicine recognizes a patient's right to access their own protected health information."*

Form number F#2197r, approved 06/02/2023, issued 06/08/2023. File size: 341 KB.

UAB Hospital provides three distinct forms. Form-1 is the primary patient self-access ROI form. Form-2 is a Callahan Eye Hospital variant (approved 7/25/2025), and form-3 is a general third-party authorization form (garbled text extraction due to CID font issues). Form-1 is the most directly relevant document for a patient seeking their own records from the main UAB Hospital facility.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Excellent findability.** Per retrieval notes, a web search for UAB Hospital authorization/release forms immediately returned direct PDF links. The form is hosted at a descriptive URL: `https://www.uabmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Patient-Request-own-medical-records.pdf` — the filename itself communicates the form's purpose.

The UAB Medicine medical records request page (`https://www.uabmedicine.org/pay-your-bill/medical-records-request/`) clearly distinguishes between patient self-access and third-party release, with separate download links for each. The retrieval agent noted: *"The web search strategy was highly effective — UAB Medicine makes their forms readily accessible with direct PDF download links."* No difficulties were encountered finding this form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Strong technical quality.** The PDF has a full text layer with clean extraction — 4,909 characters of well-formatted text with no garbling or OCR artifacts. The document reports 51 fillable fields (interactive form fields), indicating this is a digitally-designed fillable PDF rather than a scanned paper form. It uses 7 fonts and contains 4 embedded images (likely logos/branding).

At 341 KB for 2 pages, the file size is reasonable. The form is clearly digital-first: structured sections, consistent formatting, and interactive fields for patient input. This is not a scan.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Well-organized, moderate density.** The 2-page form is logically structured into distinct sections:

1. **Patient Information** (page 1, top): Name, birthdate, address, phone — standard demographic fields.
2. **Recipient designation**: *"UAB Medicine should provide records to ____ me for my personal use or to ____ the party indicated below"* — clearly positions this as a patient-access form while allowing designation of a recipient.
3. **Psychiatric/substance use opt-in**: *"Are you requesting psychiatric or substance use records to be included in the release? ____ Yes ____ No"* — explicit, clear.
4. **Date range**: Allows from/to date range or specific date. Default noted: *"If no date is listed, records for the past 12 months will be provided."*
5. **Record packages** (page 1, bulk): Five graduated packages:
   - Package 1: Key Clinical Notes (H&P, discharge summary, operative reports, outpatient clinic notes, ED documentation)
   - Package 2: Clinical Notes (Package 1 + medication list)
   - Package 3: Clinical Notes II (Packages 1+2 + diagnostic/lab reports)
   - Package 4: Lab results, radiology reports, other diagnostics
   - Package 5: Entire Medical Record (Package 3 + nursing documentation, excludes fetal monitoring strips)
   - Plus a continuity-of-care/treatment package option for provider-to-provider transfers.
   - Plus 9 individual record-type checkboxes for specific requests.
6. **Records Delivery** (page 2): Five delivery options — paper (mailed or pickup), fax, CD, email.
7. **Authorization/signature** (page 2): Signature block with patient/representative fields.
8. **Return instructions** (page 2): Mailing address and fax number for completed forms.

The language is generally clear and direct, though the package system with its nested inclusions ("Package 3 plus nursing documentation") requires some cognitive effort to parse. The form uses section dividers (dashed lines) to separate major blocks. Font size appears standard/readable based on the structured layout.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Above average for patient self-access.** Several notable design choices:

- **Dedicated patient-access form**: This is explicitly a "Patient Request for Own Medical Records" — not a generic third-party release repurposed for patient access. The opening line affirms patient rights.
- **Granular record selection**: The five-package tiered system gives patients meaningful choice over scope, from key clinical notes to entire medical records. The additional checkboxes for specific record types (operative reports, billing records, medication list, fetal monitoring strips, radiology images) add further granularity.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Paper mail, in-person pickup, fax, CD, and email. The electronic options (CD and email) include a clear notice about encryption and privacy responsibility transfer: *"I understand that the records will be encrypted to help protect my privacy..."*
- **Default scope clarity**: The 12-month default when no date is specified is clearly stated, avoiding ambiguity.
- **Sensitive records opt-in**: The psychiatric/substance use question lets patients make an informed choice about including sensitive categories.

**Gaps**: No mention of EHI export, bulk data, or patient portal access. No reference to HIPAA § 164.524 by citation (though the opening statement references the right to access). No fee information is provided. No estimated turnaround time is given.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **No notarization requirement** — signature of patient or personal representative is sufficient.
- **No in-person submission requirement** — form can be returned by mail or fax.
- **No expiration clause** on the authorization — the form does not mention when the request expires, which is appropriate for a patient self-access request (as opposed to an ongoing third-party authorization).
- **No fee disclosure** — fees are not mentioned at all, neither positively (free) nor with a schedule. This is ambiguous: it's unclear whether patients may be charged.
- **Sensitive records handling**: The form includes an authorization statement: *"This request includes any information relating to drug, alcohol use/treatment, communications with psychiatrists or psychologists, and records pertaining to sexually transmitted diseases, if they are a part of my medical record."* This is presented as part of the blanket authorization in the signature block, which is slightly at odds with the earlier opt-in question about psychiatric/substance use records.
- **Re-disclosure warning**: *"Once this information has been disclosed, it may be subject to re-disclosure and no longer protected by federal regulations."* — standard language.
- **Personal representative accommodation**: The signature block includes fields for a personal representative's name and relationship to patient.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Dedicated patient self-access form** with explicit rights-affirming language ("UAB Medicine recognizes a patient's right to access their own protected health information") — separates patient access from third-party release, which many organizations fail to do.
- **Tiered record package system** offering five graduated levels of detail — this is unusually granular and patient-friendly, letting patients choose exactly how much they need rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice.
- **Descriptive URL and filename** (`Patient-Request-own-medical-records.pdf`) — makes the form immediately identifiable in search results and downloads.
- **Multiple electronic delivery options** including both CD and email, with clear encryption/privacy notice.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Contradictory sensitive records language**: Page 1 asks *"Are you requesting psychiatric or substance use records to be included in the release? ____ Yes ____ No"* as a discrete opt-in, but page 2's authorization block states *"This request includes any information relating to drug, alcohol use/treatment, communications with psychiatrists or psychologists..."* as a blanket inclusion. If a patient checks "No" on page 1 but signs the authorization on page 2, it's unclear which controls.
- **No fee information**: The form is silent on whether any fees apply. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, fees are limited, but patients have no way to know from this form whether they'll be charged.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Page numbering error on form-2 (context)**: The Callahan Eye variant (form-2) shows "Page 3/2" on its last page — a pagination defect. Not present on form-1, but notable across the form family.
