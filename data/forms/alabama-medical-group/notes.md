## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Alabama Medical Group Mobile AL "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — returned generic results, no direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for `Alabama Medical Group Mobile AL "medical records" "release form" PDF` — identified two relevant pages:
   - Patient Forms page: https://www.alabamamedicalgroup.com/patient-resources/other-patient-forms/
   - Request Medical Records page: https://www.alabamamedicalgroup.com/patient-resources/medical-records/request-medical-records/
3. **Direct website navigation** — fetched both pages above to extract PDF links.

The forms were easy to find — clearly linked from Patient Resources sections of the website.

Includes fields for patient name, DOB, SSN, medical record number, recipient/source, purpose (legal, insurance, evaluation & treatment, other), type of information, sensitive information consent (STD, drug/alcohol, psychiatric, HIV/AIDS), signature lines, and revocation/expiration terms (1 year). Flat PDF with text layer but no fillable fields.
- **Note:** An identical copy exists at a different URL on the Patient Forms page (https://www.alabamamedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Request-for-Release-of-Information-Form-1.pdf) — same MD5 hash, not downloaded separately.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.alabamamedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PERMISSION-TO-GIVE-MEDICAL-INFORMATION-2.pdf
- **Found on page:** https://www.alabamamedicalgroup.com/patient-resources/other-patient-forms/

- **Description:** "Permission to Give Medical Information" form. Allows listing up to 3 family members authorized to receive medical information by phone. Includes acknowledgment of receiving Notice of Privacy Practices. Short, simple form — not a full ROI authorization but related to information disclosure.

## Other Forms on Patient Forms Page (not downloaded)
- **Report of Medical History** (AMG-Patient-info-form.pdf) — patient intake form, not ROI-related
- **Notice of Privacy Practices** (Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf) — privacy notice, not ROI form

## Difficulties
- None significant. Forms were straightforward to find and download. The website is well-organized with a clear Patient Resources > Medical Records section.
- The same ROI form is hosted at two different URLs (uploaded in Feb 2018 and Mar 2018), but the files are byte-for-byte identical.
- Forms are flat PDFs (no fillable fields), designed for print-and-fill workflow.
