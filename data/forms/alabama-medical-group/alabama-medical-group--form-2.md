## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **permission/consent form for phone disclosure of medical information to family members**, titled "PERMISSION TO GIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." It is not a Release of Information (ROI) authorization form. The form's sole purpose is to allow a patient to designate up to three family members who "might call for any of your medical information." It also bundles an acknowledgment that the patient has received Alabama Medical Group's Notice of Privacy Practices.

In context of Alabama Medical Group's two downloadable forms:
- **form-1.pdf**: The primary ROI authorization ("Request for Release of Information") — a general-purpose form for releasing or obtaining medical records, linked from both the "Request Medical Records" page and the "Other Patient Forms" page.
- **form-2.pdf** (this document): A narrow family-disclosure consent form, found only on the "Other Patient Forms" page. It does not serve as a mechanism for patients to request their own records.

This form is tangentially related to information disclosure but is **not an ROI form**. It functions more as an intake supplement — the kind of form a patient would complete during registration to pre-authorize phone communications with family members.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was found on the "Other Patient Forms" page at `/patient-resources/other-patient-forms/`, which is a reasonable location. The retrieval notes describe the overall search as easy, with forms "clearly linked from Patient Resources sections of the website."

The URL filename (`PERMISSION-TO-GIVE-MEDICAL-INFORMATION-2.pdf`) is descriptive and clearly identifies the form's purpose. The "-2" suffix suggests this may be a revised version, though no earlier version is linked. Like form-1, the URL path reveals a March 2018 WordPress upload date, indicating the form has not been updated in approximately 8 years.

However, a patient looking to request their own medical records would not find this form useful — it serves a different purpose. It is appropriately located on a general patient forms page rather than the medical records request page.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present. The full text (509 characters) is extractable, confirming this is not a scanned image.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. Like form-1, this is a flat PDF with no interactive fields — designed for print-and-fill.
- **File size:** 117 KB for a single page. This is reasonable, though the metadata shows 1 embedded image and 5 fonts, suggesting a logo or letterhead.
- **Page count:** 1 page.
- **Design origin:** Digitally created (clean text layer, multiple fonts), but designed entirely for a paper workflow.

The form is extremely short — only 509 characters of extractable text. With just three numbered lines for family contacts plus a signature block, there is minimal content to evaluate technically. The lack of fillable fields is a minor issue here given the form's simplicity, but it still means patients must print and hand-write entries.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality:** At one page with only 509 characters of text content, this is an extremely brief form. The content-to-page ratio suggests significant whitespace or a large logo/header image. For what it covers — three contact lines and a signature — the brevity is appropriate.

**Language clarity:** The form uses plain, simple language. The key instruction is straightforward: "List any family members that might call for any of your medical information." The revocation clause is also plain: "I understand that I may revoke this consent at any time by giving written notice to the person or organization making the disclosure."

**Organization and layout:** The form follows a minimal top-to-bottom flow:
1. Title: "PERMISSION TO GIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION"
2. Instruction line
3. Three numbered rows with columns for Emergency Contact, Relationship, and Phone Number
4. Revocation statement
5. Notice of Privacy Practices acknowledgment
6. Signature of Patient/Legal Representative and Date

**Field inventory:** The form collects: up to 3 emergency contacts (name, relationship, phone number), patient name (inline with the privacy practices acknowledgment), patient/legal representative signature, and date. That is approximately 12 data points total.

**Notable language:** The Notice of Privacy Practices acknowledgment reads: "I, ___, have received a copy of Alabama Medical Group, P.C. notice of Privacy Practices and Rights and Responsibilities, as now required by Federal Law." The phrasing "as now required by Federal Law" is outdated — HIPAA's Privacy Rule has required this since 2003, making "now required" a 23-year-old turn of phrase.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Relevance to patient access:** This form does **not** serve patients trying to access their own health records. It is a narrow consent allowing designated family members to receive information by phone. A patient seeking their own records would need form-1 instead.

**Scope:** The form is limited to phone-based information sharing with up to three family members. It does not address:
- What types of information can be shared (all medical information is implied)
- Whether there are any restrictions on what staff can discuss
- How the patient can modify the list after signing (other than full revocation)
- Whether this covers in-person visits by family members or only phone calls

**Combined consent:** The form bundles two conceptually distinct actions into one signature: (1) authorizing family member phone access, and (2) acknowledging receipt of the Notice of Privacy Practices. These are unrelated compliance requirements combined for administrative convenience.

**Right of Access:** No mention of HIPAA rights, § 164.524, or patient access rights — which is expected since this is not an access request form.

---

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Revocation:** The form states: "I understand that I may revoke this consent at any time by giving written notice to the person or organization making the disclosure." The phrase "the person or organization making the disclosure" is unusual — in context, the "organization making the disclosure" would be Alabama Medical Group itself, so patients would give written notice to AMG. But the phrasing is oddly indirect and could confuse patients about whom to notify.

**Bundled acknowledgment:** The form combines family disclosure consent with Notice of Privacy Practices acknowledgment in a single document with a single signature. While this is common in practice, it means a patient cannot acknowledge the privacy notice without also authorizing family phone access (and vice versa). This bundling is a minor concern.

**No expiration:** Unlike form-1 (which expires after one year), this form contains no expiration date or auto-revocation clause. The authorization to share information with the listed family members appears to remain in effect indefinitely unless the patient submits a written revocation. For an ongoing phone disclosure consent, indefinite duration is arguably appropriate, but it means the patient bears the burden of remembering to revoke if circumstances change (e.g., divorce, estrangement).

**Limit of three contacts:** The form provides space for exactly three family contacts. Patients with larger families or more complex care situations have no mechanism to add additional authorized contacts.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Any of your medical information" is unbounded.** The form authorizes sharing "any of your medical information" with listed family members by phone, with no carve-outs for sensitive categories (STD, substance abuse, psychiatric, HIV/AIDS). Form-1 specifically addresses sensitive information consent with a dual signature block, but this form contains no such mechanism. It is unclear whether staff would apply state-law protections for sensitive categories when responding to family phone calls authorized by this form.

- **Revocation notice recipient is unclear.** The revocation clause directs the patient to give "written notice to the person or organization making the disclosure." While this logically means Alabama Medical Group, the indirect phrasing could confuse patients about whom to contact and where to send the written revocation.

- **Bundled consent and acknowledgment.** Combining family phone disclosure authorization with Notice of Privacy Practices acknowledgment in one form with one signature means patients cannot do one without the other. A patient who wants to acknowledge the privacy notice but not authorize family disclosure (or vice versa) has no path to do so.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Outdated "now required" language.** The phrase "as now required by Federal Law" referring to the Notice of Privacy Practices has been stale since the HIPAA Privacy Rule took effect in 2003. Combined with the 2018 upload date, this language appears to have been drafted shortly after HIPAA implementation and never updated.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Plain language.** The form uses genuinely simple, accessible language throughout. The instruction "List any family members that might call for any of your medical information" is clear and conversational — no legalese, no jargon. For the narrow task it covers, this form is easy for any patient to understand.
