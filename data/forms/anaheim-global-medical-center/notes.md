# Anaheim Global Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Anaheim Global Medical Center (AGMC)
- **Website**: https://www.anaheimglobalmedicalcenter.com/
- **Location**: 1025 South Anaheim Blvd, Anaheim, CA 92805
- **Parent System**: KPC Health (formerly known as Western Medical Center - Anaheim)
- **Phone**: (714) 533-6220

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web search for ROI/authorization form PDFs**: Searched for `"Anaheim Global Medical Center" authorization release health information form PDF` and similar queries. Results initially pointed to AHMC Healthcare (Anaheim Regional Medical Center) forms, which is a **different hospital/system** — not AGMC.

2. **Clarified parent system**: Anaheim Global Medical Center is part of **KPC Health**, not AHMC Healthcare. Searched specifically for KPC Health authorization forms — no downloadable PDF forms found for any KPC Health facility.

3. **Website navigation**: Browsed the AGMC website including:
   - Homepage
   - Patient & Family Resources page
   - Notice of Privacy Practices page
   - Billing & Payments page
   - Contact Us page
   - About page
   - Services page
   No ROI/authorization form PDF was found on any page.

4. **Comprehensive PDF scan**: Scraped all PDF links across all major pages of the website. Found only:
   - Notice of Privacy Practices (English/Spanish)
   - Service Modification Notice
   - Financial Assistance / Charity Care / Debt Collection policies
   - Self-Screening Poster
   - Allocation Guidelines
   - Health Equity document
   No ROI/authorization form among any of them.

5. **ChartRequest portal**: The hospital's "Access Medical Records" link on the Patient & Family Resources page directs to **https://app.chartrequest.com/m/KPC-locations**, a third-party web portal. The portal requires account creation (LOGIN/SIGN UP) to submit a medical records request. Anaheim Global Medical Center is listed as a location in the dropdown. No downloadable PDF authorization form is provided through this portal.

6. **Searched sister KPC Health hospitals**: Checked Orange County Global Medical Center, Chapman Global Medical Center, South Coast Global Medical Center — none have downloadable ROI forms either. All KPC Health facilities appear to use ChartRequest.

## What Was Found

### No ROI/Authorization Form Available as Downloadable PDF

Anaheim Global Medical Center does **not** publish a downloadable ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form on their website. Instead, they direct patients to a third-party web portal (ChartRequest by KPC Healthcare, Inc.) which requires account creation to submit medical records requests online.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.anaheimglobalmedicalcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AGMC-NPP-2016-English.pdf
- **Document type**: Notice of Privacy Practices (NOT an ROI form)
- **Description**: 8-page AGMC Notice of Privacy Practices effective January 31, 2016. Describes how medical information may be used and disclosed. While not an ROI form, it is the closest patient-facing privacy document available on the website and describes patients' rights regarding access to their medical information.
- **File size**: 303,793 bytes
- **Has text layer**: Yes (23,205 characters extracted)

## Difficulties Encountered

1. **Confusion with similarly-named hospital**: Initial searches returned forms for AHMC Anaheim Regional Medical Center, which is a completely different hospital system. Care was needed to distinguish between AHMC Healthcare and KPC Health.

2. **No downloadable form available**: The hospital relies entirely on the ChartRequest third-party portal for medical records requests. No PDF authorization form is published on their website.

3. **ChartRequest requires account creation**: The ChartRequest portal (https://app.chartrequest.com/m/KPC-locations) requires users to create an account before they can submit a medical records request, making it impossible to evaluate the authorization form without registering.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard

The ROI form is effectively not available as a downloadable document. Patients must use the ChartRequest web portal with account creation, which represents a barrier to accessing the authorization process.
