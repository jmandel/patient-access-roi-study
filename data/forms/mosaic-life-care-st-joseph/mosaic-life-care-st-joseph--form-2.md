# Evaluation: Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION / ACCESS REQUEST FROM MOSAIC LIFE CARE TO ANOTHER AGENCY" — a general-purpose ROI authorization form, Form # 3014, dated 11/24/15. It is the **older** of two versions of the same form (form number 3014) found on Mosaic Life Care's website. The newer version (form-1.pdf, dated 03/28/19) was found on the Health Information Management page and features additional content including specific facility checkboxes, a deceased-patient section, and a multilingual language-assistance notice on page 2. This older version (form-2.pdf) was found on a separate HIPAA Authorization Form page under the Privacy Policy section.

Having two versions of the same form (same form number, different dates) published simultaneously on different pages of the website creates a risk that patients will find and use the outdated version.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was located at `/General/Privacy-Policy/HIPAA-Authorization-Form/` — nested under the Privacy Policy section rather than the more intuitive Health Information Management or Patient Resources path. The URL for the PDF itself (`auth-from-hipaa3014.pdf`) is descriptive enough to identify the document type but includes a typo ("from" instead of "form"). The form was reachable in approximately 2–3 clicks from the homepage, which is reasonable, but a patient looking for medical records release would more naturally navigate to the HIM page (where form-1.pdf is linked). The placement under Privacy Policy makes this version harder to discover for its intended purpose.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — the document has extractable text (4,754 characters) and is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive form fields; all blanks are represented by underscore characters in the text layer (e.g., `"MRN:_____________________________"`). Patients must print and hand-fill.
- **File size**: 90,539 bytes (91 KB) for a one-page document — reasonably compact.
- **Font count**: 4 fonts embedded.
- **Embedded images**: 4 images (likely checkbox graphics or a logo).
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is a print-oriented flat PDF. The checkbox options for record types and purpose are rendered as text items without interactive check/radio controls. There is no way to complete this form digitally without third-party annotation tools.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page. All content — patient demographics, release-from/release-to fields, record type checkboxes, purpose checkboxes, legal disclosures, and signature block — is compressed onto a single page. This is concise but makes the layout quite dense.

**Clarity**: The form uses moderately plain language but includes legal passages that verge on legalese, particularly the bottom disclosure paragraphs. The bullet points under "By signing this authorization form, I understand that:" are reasonably clear, covering revocation rights, expiration, voluntariness, and re-disclosure risk. However, some of these run to multi-line paragraphs in small print.

**Organization**: The form flows logically: patient identification → release-from → release-to → record types → date range → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. The two-column layout for parts of the form (demographics on left, record types on right) makes reasonable use of space.

**Record type options**: The form provides 13 specific record-type checkboxes plus an "Other" line:
- Pertinent Information, History & Physical, Emergency Room Report, Lab Results, Consultations, Pathology Results, Operative Reports, Pathology Slides, Radiology Reports, Discharge Summary, Radiology Films/Other Diagnostic Images, Complete Billing Record/Itemized Bill, Complete Health Record

**Purpose options**: 12 checkboxes plus "Other":
- Medical, Personal, Insurance, Legal, Disability, Law Enforcement, FMLA, Research, School, Military, Adoption, Department of Social Service

**Date range**: Offers "Specific Date(s)" with from/to fields, "All," and a "Diagnosis" line.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form title — "ACCESS REQUEST FROM MOSAIC LIFE CARE TO ANOTHER AGENCY" — frames this as a release of records *to a third party*, not as a patient self-access request. While a patient could technically use it to request their own records, there is no specific pathway, language, or option dedicated to a patient obtaining their own records directly. "Personal" appears as one of 12 purpose options, but nothing distinguishes a HIPAA Right of Access request from a general third-party release.

**Format/delivery options**: The form does not offer any electronic delivery option. There is no mention of email delivery, patient portal access, CD/USB, or any digital format. The "release to" section collects a mailing address, phone, fax, and email — but these appear to be contact details for the recipient, not delivery method choices.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The only HIPAA-adjacent reference is the title mentioning "HIPAA Authorization Form" on the webpage, and the legal disclosures reference 42 CFR Part 2 (substance abuse confidentiality rules). The form states "I understand that I do not have to sign this authorization, that my treatment or payment for services will not be denied if I do not sign this authorization, and that I can inspect or copy the protected health information to be used or disclosed" — this is a standard HIPAA authorization clause but does not affirmatively explain patient rights.

**EHI Export / bulk data**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Fee disclosure**: The form states: "Requests for copies of medical records and/or non-document material may be subject to copying fees." This is vague — no fee schedule, no dollar amounts, no reference to HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient access requests.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: "Unless otherwise revoked, this authorization will expire on the following date/event/condition: _______________. If I fail to specify an expiration date/event/condition, this authorization will expire one year from the date signed." A one-year default expiration is a common and reasonable provision.

**Revocation**: The form correctly states the right to revoke in writing, and that revocation does not apply retroactively.

**Conditioning of treatment**: The form includes the required statement that treatment/payment will not be conditioned on signing.

**Outdated entity name**: The legal disclaimer states: "Heartland Regional Medical Center, its affiliates, its employees, and officers are not legally responsible or liable for the re-disclosure of the information indicated on this authorization." This references the organization's **former name** — Mosaic Life Care was formerly Heartland Regional Medical Center. This is a factual error on the current version of the form; the newer form-1.pdf has been updated to say "Mosaic Life Care."

**42 CFR Part 2 notice**: The form includes a proper notice about substance abuse records and re-disclosure restrictions.

**Sensitive information inclusion**: The form states PHI "may include records relating to mental health care, sexually transmitted diseases, Genetic/Metabolic Testing, HIV/AIDS, and/or treatment of alcohol/drug abuse." This broad inclusion without separate opt-in checkboxes means signing the form authorizes release of all sensitive categories. Some states require separate consent for these categories.

**Verification line**: The form includes "Identification type___ Verified by___ Date:___" — this is an internal administrative field but its presence on the patient-facing form could confuse patients or imply in-person verification is required.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Vague fee language with no HIPAA context**: The statement "may be subject to copying fees" provides no information about fee amounts or limits. For a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access, fees are limited to a reasonable, cost-based amount — but the form doesn't distinguish between patient access and third-party release, so patients have no way to know what to expect or what their rights are regarding fees.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"ACCESS REQUEST FROM MOSAIC LIFE CARE TO ANOTHER AGENCY"**: The subtitle is confusing — it could be read as Mosaic Life Care requesting records from another agency, or as a request to release records from Mosaic Life Care to another agency. The form body makes clear it's the latter, but the title language is awkward.
- **Verification line on patient-facing form**: The "Identification type___ Verified by___" line could lead patients to believe they must present ID in person, even though the notes indicate the form can be submitted by email, mail, or fax. It's unclear whether this is an internal-use field or a patient requirement.
- **Two versions of the same form online**: Having both form-2.pdf (dated 11/24/15) and form-1.pdf (dated 03/28/19) simultaneously available under the same form number 3014 creates confusion about which is current. There is no "superseded" notice on this older version.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Outdated organization name in legal disclaimer**: The disclaimer references "Heartland Regional Medical Center" — the organization's former name. The newer form-1.pdf correctly uses "Mosaic Life Care." This error has persisted since the form was last updated in 2015.
- **PDF filename typo**: The source URL contains `auth-from-hipaa3014.pdf` — "from" appears to be a typo for "form."
- **Page count discrepancy**: The retrieval notes describe this as a 2-page form, but the metadata indicates 1 page and the extracted text contains only a single form-feed character, confirming it is a single page.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular record-type selection**: The form offers 13 specific record categories plus "Other," giving patients meaningful control over what is released rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice.
- **Multiple submission channels**: Per the retrieval notes, the form can be submitted via email (ROI@myMLC.com), mail, or fax — providing flexibility beyond in-person submission (though these options are not stated on the form itself).
