# Mosaic Life Care at St. Joseph — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `"Mosaic Life Care" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` and similar queries. Initial results pointed to a .docx file on the site and several unrelated "Mosaic" organizations (Mosaic Health in NY, Mosaic Community Health in OR).

2. **Site-specific search**: `site:mymlc.com authorization release medical records` — found the Health Information Management page and a HIPAA Authorization Form page.

3. **Website navigation**: Navigated to the HIM page (`/Main/Service/health-information-management/`) which had an "Authorizations and Forms" section with direct links to:
   - Authorization For Release of Protected Health Information (PDF)
   - Restriction Request (web form)
   - Medical Records Amendment Request (web form)

4. **HIPAA Authorization Form page**: Found a second link under Privacy Policy > HIPAA Authorization Form (`/General/Privacy-Policy/HIPAA-Authorization-Form/`) pointing to a different PDF.

## Downloaded Forms

- **Source URL**: https://www.mymlc.com/contentassets/a22d8e2c70614860b8feea5e488cdd16/authorization-for-release-of-phi.pdf
- **Found on**: Health Information Management page → "Authorizations and Forms" section
- **File size**: 601,526 bytes (602 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request to Another Agency
- **Notes**: This appears to be the current/updated version of the ROI form. It lists specific Mosaic Life Care facilities (Medical Center - Albany, Maryville, Saint Joseph, LTACH). Form # 3014, dated 03.28.19. Includes multi-language notice section on page 2. Has text layer (not a scan). Mentions "Heartland Regional Medical Center" in the legal disclaimer text (the organization's former name). Includes options for types of records, date ranges, and purpose for release.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mymlc.com/contentassets/4fcfecbcab604b579303760a042cacf5/auth-from-hipaa3014.pdf
- **Found on**: HIPAA Authorization Form page (`/General/Privacy-Policy/HIPAA-Authorization-Form/`)
- **File size**: 90,539 bytes (91 KB)
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information / Access Request from Mosaic Life Care to Another Agency
- **Notes**: Similar form to form-1 but appears to be an older or alternate version. Uses "Mosaic Life Care" as the facility name (not broken out by location). Smaller file size suggests different formatting/fewer embedded images. Also references "Heartland Regional Medical Center" in the legal fine print. Same form number (3014).

## Additional Observations

- Mosaic Life Care was formerly known as Heartland Health / Heartland Regional Medical Center; both form versions still reference this old name in legal disclaimers.
- The organization also provides a .docx version of the form at `https://www.mymlc.com/globalassets/authorization-for-release-of-information-3014-066-1.docx` — this is the oldest version still using "Heartland Health" branding throughout.
- Forms can be submitted via email to ROI@myMLC.com, or by mail/fax to the HIM office at 105 Far West Drive, Suite 202, St. Joseph, MO 64506.
- The site uses Epic MyChart for online patient record access.
- Both forms are general ROI/release-to-third-party forms, not specific to patient self-access under HIPAA Right of Access.

## Difficulties

- No significant difficulties. Forms were relatively easy to find (2-3 clicks from homepage).
- The organization has two slightly different versions of the same form linked from different pages, which could be confusing for patients.
- The .docx version found via search was an older version with outdated branding.
