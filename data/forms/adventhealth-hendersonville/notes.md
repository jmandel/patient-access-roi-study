# AdventHealth Hendersonville — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: AdventHealth Hendersonville (formerly Park Ridge Hospital)
- **Website**: https://www.adventhealth.com/hospital/adventhealth-hendersonville
- **Location**: 100 Hospital Drive, Hendersonville, NC 28792
- **System**: AdventHealth (major nonprofit system)

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web search for authorization/release forms (partially successful)
- Searched: `AdventHealth Hendersonville "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`
- Searched: `AdventHealth "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF download`
- Searched: `AdventHealth Hendersonville NC medical records request form download`
- Searched: `"Park Ridge Hospital" Hendersonville NC authorization release form PDF`
- Found several PDF forms hosted on adventhealth.com, but **none specific to AdventHealth Hendersonville**. The PDFs found were from sister facilities (St. Luke's Hospital in Columbus, NC and Florida Hospital Heartland Division in Sebring, FL).

### 2. Website navigation (successful — found primary method)
- Navigated to AdventHealth Hendersonville homepage → footer link "Medical Records"
- Medical Records page URL: https://www.adventhealth.com/hospital/adventhealth-hendersonville/medical-records
- Page has a "Who to Contact" section with tabs by region
- Under "Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina Locations" tab, AdventHealth Hendersonville is listed with:
  - Phone: 828-681-2135
  - Fax: 828-651-4018
  - **Online eRequest Form**: https://www.swellbox.com/adventhealth-mid-wizard.html
- **No downloadable PDF form is provided.** The facility uses an online Swellbox/Datavant wizard for all records requests.

### 3. Direct URL guessing for Hendersonville-specific PDFs (unsuccessful)
- Tried URL patterns like `hvl_form_medicalrecords_*`, `prh_form_medicalrecords_*` — all returned 404.

- **Source URL**: https://www.adventhealth.com/sites/default/files/assets/WAU_FH-Records-Request-Form.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure and Request for Access to Protected Health Information
- **Facility**: Florida Hospital Heartland Division, 4200 Sun n' Lake Blvd., Sebring, FL 33871 (completely different facility)
- **Pages**: 1
- **Size**: 82,773 bytes
- **Notes**: Florida-specific form with 90-day expiration. Not relevant to AdventHealth Hendersonville. Downloaded because it appeared in web search results as a general AdventHealth form.

## Key Findings

1. **AdventHealth Hendersonville does not publish a downloadable PDF ROI/authorization form on their website.** Their primary mechanism for medical records requests is the Swellbox/Datavant online eRequest wizard.

2. The medical records page mentions that "paper copies of medical records may be released upon receipt of written authorization" but does not provide a downloadable authorization form — the accordion sections and "authorization form" links all point to the same location table with Swellbox links.

3. The closest PDF forms available are from St. Luke's Hospital (now AdventHealth) in Columbus, NC — a sister facility in the same Western NC region, ~40 miles away. These forms (form-1.pdf and form-2.pdf) still carry "St. Luke's Hospital" branding from before the AdventHealth rebranding.

4. AdventHealth Hendersonville was formerly known as Park Ridge Hospital. No PDF forms under the Park Ridge name were found online.

## Difficulties
- No Hendersonville-specific PDF form exists online — the facility relies entirely on the Swellbox online wizard
- Web search results returned forms from other AdventHealth facilities, requiring careful verification of which facility each form belongs to
- The medical records page is shared across the entire AdventHealth system, making it harder to find location-specific information
