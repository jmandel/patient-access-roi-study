# Evaluation: Community Health Centers of Burlington — form-1.pdf

**Organization:** Community Health Centers of Burlington (Burlington, VT)
**Document:** "Authorization to Send Health Information" (Revised November 2023)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is the primary Release of Information (ROI) form for CHCB — a one-page, fillable PDF titled "AUTHORIZATION TO SEND HEALTH INFORMATION." It covers the release of medical, mental health/psychiatric, and dental records. The organization also has a companion document (form-2.pdf), "Authorization for Verbal Communication (Only)," which is limited to verbal disclosure and explicitly states "No paper records will be sent." Form-1 is the more comprehensive document and the one a patient would use to request copies of their records. Both forms share the same legal boilerplate, revision date (November 2023), and overall structure.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was discoverable via a site-scoped web search (`site:chcb.org medical records release authorization form`), which returned a direct link to the PDF hosted in a WordPress uploads directory (`/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/`). The URL itself is reasonably descriptive: `Consent-to-Disclose-Health-Information-2024-FILLABLE.pdf`. However, the organization's forms page at `https://www.chcb.org/forms/` did not render content when fetched — likely due to JavaScript rendering — meaning a patient navigating the website directly might not find it without search. There is no evidence the form is linked from a clearly labeled "Medical Records" or "Patient Resources" page. Findability is moderate: easily searchable but not prominently surfaced through site navigation.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present. Full text is extractable (3,701 characters), making the document screen-reader accessible and searchable.
- **Fillable fields:** 36 interactive form fields are present, making this a genuinely fillable PDF. Field names are not enumerated in metadata but the field count is high relative to the form's content, suggesting most blanks are interactive.
- **File format:** 164 KB for a single page — reasonable. Includes 1 embedded image (likely a logo) and 5 fonts.
- **Digital-first design:** This is clearly a born-digital document, not a scan. The fillable fields, clean text layer, and modest file size all confirm it was designed for electronic completion.

Overall, this is technically well-executed as a digital artifact. It can be filled on-screen, printed, and processed without difficulty.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** One page. This is impressively compact for a form covering medical, mental health, and dental records with full legal language.

**Organization:** The form follows a logical flow: header with fax/email contact info → patient demographics → reason for release (checkboxes) → record type selection (Medical / Mental Health / Dental, each with date ranges) → sender/recipient blocks → expiration → legal disclosures → signature → revocation section. The structure is intuitive.

**Clarity:** The language is a mix of plain English and legal boilerplate. The record selection section is clear and patient-friendly — e.g., "COMPLETE HEALTH RECORD - This includes past medical records from outside agencies that CHC has on file." The legal paragraph at the bottom is denser but not unreasonably so.

**Reason for release options:** Six checkboxes: "Coordination of care," "Transfer care," "Legal purposes," "Patient copy," "Second opinion," "Other (please describe)." The inclusion of "Patient copy" as a standalone option is notable and patient-friendly.

**Record type granularity:** Patients can select from three categories (Medical, Mental Health/Psychiatry, Dental), each with checkboxes for complete records or "Other" with free-text. Date ranges are available for medical and mental health records. The dental section offers "Dental x-rays – All" and "Other."

**Layout:** Dense but not cramped. Fitting everything onto one page requires small margins and tight spacing, but the use of bold headers, checkbox formatting, and horizontal rules maintains readability.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form is titled "Authorization to Send Health Information" and is framed as a disclosure/release form rather than a patient access request. However, the inclusion of "Patient copy" as a reason for release indicates it is intended to serve both purposes. There is no separate, dedicated patient access request form.

**Scope options:** Good. Patients can select specific record categories, specify date ranges, and describe specific items under "Other." The form states: "If no dates are specified, all records of this type selected will be shared."

**Delivery format:** The header provides practical routing information — "Fax Medical Records to: (802) 860-4313" and "Email Dental Records to: dentalxrays@chcb.org" — but these appear to be instructions for *receiving* records at CHCB, not for sending records *to* the patient. The form authorizes disclosure "in the following formats: verbal, written, electronic, unless otherwise specified here," which is broad but does not let the patient explicitly choose their preferred delivery method.

**Right of Access language:** The form references HIPAA generally — "the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ('HIPAA'), 45 Parts 160 and 164" — but does not specifically cite the Right of Access provision (§ 164.524) or explain patient rights in plain language.

**EHI Export / electronic access:** No mention of electronic health information export, patient portal access, or bulk data options.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** The form states: "I understand that if I do not state a date of expiration above, then this consent will expire one year from the last date of service to me at CHC." This is a reasonable default expiration.

**Revocation:** The form includes an explicit revocation section at the bottom: "I understand that I may revoke this consent at any time. My decision to revoke this consent will not affect the records that were previously released under this consent." This is HIPAA-compliant and clearly stated.

**Denial of services language:** The form includes: "I understand that I might be denied services if I refuse to consent to a disclosure for purposes of treatment, payment, or health care operations. I will not be denied services if I refuse to consent to a disclosure for other purposes." This accurately reflects the HIPAA conditioning-of-treatment rule but uses the word "might" rather than clearly delineating when denial is permissible.

**Submission method:** No explicit instructions on how to submit the completed form. No mention of in-person-only requirements, but also no mention of electronic submission, mailing address, or fax number for returning the form.

**Fees:** No mention of fees or costs.

**Facsimile acceptance:** The form states "A photocopy or facsimile of this consent is valid as is the original," which removes a potential barrier.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Sender/recipient confusion on patient access requests.** The form has two blocks: "Information REQUESTED FROM" and "Information RELEASED TO." For a patient requesting their own records, it's unclear how to fill this out — should the patient put CHCB as "REQUESTED FROM" and themselves as "RELEASED TO"? The fax/email in the header ("Fax Medical Records to: (802) 860-4313") appear to be for *incoming* records to CHCB, adding to the confusion about directionality.
- **Verbal communication line in a records-release form.** The second line states "This form allows CHC to verbally communicate with the authorized person or organization listed below," which contradicts the form's primary purpose of sending records. This language appears to be carried over from the verbal-only consent form (form-2) and may confuse patients about whether this form actually results in paper/electronic records being sent.
- **No submission instructions.** A patient who completes this form has no guidance on where to send it — no mailing address, no fax number for returning forms, no email for submission.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **"Patient copy" as an explicit reason for release.** Including this as a checkbox option normalizes patient access requests alongside other disclosure reasons, rather than treating patient access as an afterthought.
- **One-page design.** Fitting a comprehensive ROI form — covering three record categories with date ranges, legal disclosures, and a revocation section — onto a single page is efficient and reduces patient burden.
- **36 fillable fields.** The form is genuinely designed for on-screen completion, not just a printable template.
- **Photocopy/facsimile acceptance.** Explicitly stating that copies are valid removes a potential barrier for patients who cannot submit originals.
