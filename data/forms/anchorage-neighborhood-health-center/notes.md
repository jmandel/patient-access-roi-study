# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf** — No direct ANHC results; returned generic examples from other organizations.
2. **Web search for "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf** — Found a related ROI instructions document on choices-ak.org mentioning ANHC's mailing/fax details.
3. **Web search for site:anhc.org authorization release medical records** — Successfully identified the ANHC forms page at https://www.anhc.org/forms with direct PDF links.
4. **Fetched the ANHC forms page** — Found clearly organized sections including "Request a Release of Information" with the main ROI form and a separate "PHI Disclosure Agreement."

The third search strategy (site-scoped search) was most effective, directly surfacing the forms page.

## Downloaded Forms

Includes sections for patient demographics, choice of obtain vs. release, types of information (History & Physical, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, X-Ray Reports, Immunization Records, Medication List), and special authorization for sensitive topics (Substance Use Disorder).

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.anhc.org/s/PHIDisclosureAgreementENGLISH9-22-23.pdf
- **Document title:** "PHI Disclosure Agreement"
- **Revision:** Rev. 8/4/23
- **Initial impression:** This is a PHI (Protected Health Information) Disclosure Agreement — a standing authorization form that lets patients designate specific people who may access their PHI. Also covers MyChart proxy access for minors (ages 12-17). Single page form. Not a traditional ROI form but related to information sharing authorization.
- **File size:** ~128 KB
- **Has text layer:** Yes

## Difficulties Encountered

- **None significant.** The forms were easy to find on the ANHC website. The forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms) is well-organized with clear section headings. The ROI form was available in both English and Spanish, and the PDF downloaded without any bot blocking or authentication requirements.
- The organization also offers an online/text-based option for ROI requests (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which is notable for accessibility.

## Additional Context

- ANHC also has a "Notice of Privacy Practices" PDF available on the same forms page, but this was not downloaded as it's a privacy notice rather than an authorization form.
- The choices-ak.org site had ROI instructions referencing ANHC, suggesting a historical or affiliated relationship, but the current ANHC website has its own updated forms.
