## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **standing PHI disclosure agreement**, not a traditional Release of Information or records-request authorization form. It allows patients to designate specific individuals who may access their Protected Health Information at ANHC on an ongoing basis. It also governs MyChart proxy access for minors aged 12–17.

This is the **second of two forms** found on ANHC's forms page. The primary ROI form is form-1.pdf ("Advanced Authorization for Release of Information," Rev. 8/2025), which serves the traditional purpose of authorizing ANHC to send or receive specific records in a one-time transaction. Form-2 serves a different function: establishing a persistent list of people authorized to access a patient's PHI, more akin to an access-control list than a records release.

The two forms are complementary. A patient requesting copies of their own records would use form-1, not this form. This form addresses the question: "Who else can ANHC talk to about my health information?"

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found on ANHC's well-organized forms page at https://www.anhc.org/forms, under a clearly labeled section. The site-scoped search (`site:anhc.org authorization release medical records`) surfaced the forms page directly. The filename (`PHIDisclosureAgreementENGLISH9-22-23.pdf`) is descriptive, includes a language tag ("ENGLISH"), and embeds a date — all useful signals, though the date in the filename (9-22-23) does not match the revision date printed on the form (8/4/23), which is a minor inconsistency.

The forms page context described in the notes mentions a "PHI Disclosure Agreement" as a distinct item from the ROI form, so a patient navigating the page would understand these are separate documents. Overall findability is good — the form is publicly available, directly linked, and clearly labeled.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present and clean. The full text extracts coherently with no OCR artifacts or garbled characters.

**Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite being a form with clear data-entry fields (patient name, date of birth, seven rows of designated persons with name/relationship/DOB/MyChart proxy columns, and a signature line), none of these are implemented as interactive PDF form fields. A patient would need to print and hand-fill, or use a PDF annotation tool.

**File size:** At 128 KB for a single-page document with 2 embedded images, this is a reasonable size.

**Digital-first design:** The form appears to be a digitally authored document (not a scan), with clean fonts and structured layout. However, the absence of any fillable fields undercuts its usability as a digital artifact. A patient receiving this electronically has no native way to complete it on screen.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** One page — appropriately concise for its purpose.

**Clarity:** The form uses plain, accessible language. The opening section explains PHI clearly: "Protected health information (PHI) includes demographic information, health history, test results, insurance information, and more." The bullet-pointed guidance ("Who should you list on this form?") is well-organized and covers three use cases: general PHI access, language interpretation assistance, and parent/guardian proxy access for minors.

**Organization:** The form flows logically: patient identification → policy explanation → guidance on who to list → duration/revocation info → data table → signature. The information hierarchy is clear.

**Layout:** The seven-row table for listing designated persons is structured with columns for Name, Relationship, Date of birth, and a Yes/No MyChart proxy access question. This is visually clean and easy to follow. The form uses bullet points, bold headers, and adequate whitespace for a single-page document.

**Readability:** Font sizes appear adequate based on the content density (1,331 characters on one page with 6 fonts and a multi-row table). The language is pitched at an accessible reading level.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This form is explicitly about designating others who may access the patient's PHI — it is a third-party authorization tool, not a patient self-access form. A patient trying to obtain copies of their own records would need form-1, not this document.

**Scope options:** The form does not allow granular control over what types of PHI each designated person can access. Authorization is all-or-nothing: "I allow ANHC to disclose my personal health information to the following people." There is no ability to restrict a designee to, say, only appointment information or only lab results.

**MyChart proxy access:** The form thoughtfully addresses MyChart proxy access, particularly for minors aged 12–17. The text explains: "If you are age 12 to 17, your parents and/or guardians will only have access to your MyChart account as a proxy if you list them on this form." This gives adolescent patients explicit control over parental access to their patient portal — a meaningful privacy protection.

**Duration and revocation:** The form states: "This PHI disclosure agreement will remain in effect unless we receive written notice from you. You may make changes to your PHI disclosure agreement at any time." This is clearly explained, though it means the authorization has no automatic expiration — it persists indefinitely until actively revoked.

**Format/delivery options:** The form itself does not mention electronic submission, email, or fax as delivery methods. No delivery instructions are printed on the form.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No-expiration authorization:** The standing nature of this form (no expiration date) is a design choice that could cut both ways. It's convenient for patients who don't want to re-authorize periodically, but it means old authorizations remain active if a patient forgets about them. There's no reminder mechanism described.

**No barriers noted:** The form doesn't impose notarization requirements, fees, or other HIPAA-impermissible conditions. It requires only a signature and today's date.

**Scope of disclosure:** The all-or-nothing PHI disclosure structure ("disclose my personal health information") is broad — it doesn't carve out sensitive categories (substance use disorder, mental health, HIV) that might warrant separate authorization under state or federal law. This is notable because form-1 (the ROI form) explicitly lists these sensitive categories with separate checkboxes. Whether this broad standing authorization adequately addresses 42 CFR Part 2 protections for substance use disorder records is a question worth flagging.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions:** The form provides no guidance on how or where to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, email, or instruction to return it in person. A patient downloading this form from the website would not know what to do with it after completing it. (By contrast, form-1 includes ANHC's full address, phone, and fax.)

- **Blanket PHI authorization without sensitive-category carve-outs:** The form authorizes disclosure of "my personal health information" without addressing sensitive categories separately. It's unclear whether this standing authorization would cover substance use disorder records (protected under 42 CFR Part 2), mental health records, or HIV-related information — all of which form-1 treats as requiring separate, explicit consent.

- **Filename/revision date mismatch:** The filename includes "9-22-23" while the printed revision date is "Rev. 8/4/23." It's unclear which date is authoritative, or whether the document was revised between these dates.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Adolescent privacy protection:** The explicit handling of MyChart proxy access for minors aged 12–17 is thoughtful. Requiring adolescents to affirmatively list parents/guardians before they gain portal access respects minor patients' developing autonomy — a practice that aligns with best practices in adolescent health privacy.

- **Plain-language PHI explanation:** The opening paragraph defines PHI in simple, inclusive terms ("includes demographic information, health history, test results, insurance information, and more") rather than citing legal definitions, making the form accessible to patients without legal or medical literacy.

- **Language interpretation use case:** Including "Language interpretation assistance" as an explicit reason to list someone on the form shows awareness of the needs of patients with limited English proficiency — a practical consideration often overlooked in authorization forms.
