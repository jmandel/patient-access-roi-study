# Blessing Hospital — Form 5 Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-5 is the **Spanish-language translation** of the current BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information, dated **09/2025** (document ID: 18929997). It is the direct counterpart of form-4.pdf (the current English version, same document ID and date). The title is bilingual: "Autorización de BHS para la divulgación de información médicac / (BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information)."

Five forms were found for Blessing Hospital total. Forms 1 and 2 are older English variants from April 2023 (one with a "Medical Record Number" header, one without). Form 3 is an even older undated English version with a different layout. Forms 4 (English) and 5 (Spanish) are the **currently linked versions** on the Blessing Health website's Medical Records page. Form 5 is the only non-English form in the set — no other languages were found.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, the Spanish form was found through a `site:blessinghealth.org` search and is linked directly from the Medical Records page at https://www.blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords. The URL is descriptive and clearly labeled: `BH_Authorize_Release_Of_Medical_Records_Spanish_9-2025.pdf`. The page itself is accessible under "For Patients > Request Medical Records."

The findability is good overall. A Spanish-speaking patient navigating the website would need to know where to look, as the website navigation is primarily in English. However, the form being linked from the same Medical Records page as the English version means it is discoverable with minimal effort once the patient reaches that page.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — the full 7,540-character Spanish text is extractable via pdftotext. This is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (0). The form has no interactive PDF form fields. Patients must print and fill by hand or use PDF annotation tools.
- **File size:** 332,802 bytes (~333 KB) for 2 pages. This is larger than the English counterpart (form-4 at 271 KB) and substantially larger than the older English version (form-3 at 50 KB). The size is inflated for a 2-page text-dominant form, likely due to embedded images/logos.
- **Fonts:** 7 fonts embedded.
- **Embedded images:** 2 (likely logos/headers).
- **Digital-first design:** No. This is a flat PDF designed for printing, with manual "Encierre en un círculo" (circle) instructions — e.g., "¿Llamar cuando esté listo? (Encierre en un círculo) Sí No" and "(Encierre en un círculo) Retiro o Envío por correo postal o Fax o Correo electrónico." These instructions assume physical interaction with a printed page.
- **PolicyStat hosting:** The footer references "Copia oficial en https://blessing-forms.policystat.com/" indicating a policy management system is used for version control.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages — page 1 is the authorization form itself; page 2 is a "Pautas para completar" (guidelines for completing) section with field-by-field instructions plus HIM contact information for three locations. The length is proportionate.

**Organization:** The form follows a logical flow: patient demographics → source/destination of records → record type checkboxes → sensitive information authorization → purpose → legal disclosures → signatures → guidelines. This mirrors the English version (form-4) exactly.

**Record type granularity:** The form offers approximately 15 checkbox categories for record types including "Resumen de atención continua," "Resumen de alta," "Informes de radiología," "Registros de vacunación," "Historial médico y exámenes físicos," "Imágenes de radiología," "Informes quirúrgicos," "Consultas médicas," therapy notes, ER reports, cardiology reports, lab/pathology, office notes, and an "Otros (especifique)" option. This is a strong level of specificity.

**Sensitive information handling:** A separate section requires explicit authorization for "Informes de salud mental," "Análisis genético," "ETS/SIDA/VIH," and "Consumo de drogas/alcohol" with a required date range. This is appropriate for Illinois law.

**Clarity of language:** The Spanish translation is generally competent. Medical terminology is presented with parenthetical abbreviations — e.g., "PT (fisioterapia), ST (terapia del habla), OT (terapia ocupacional)" and "EKG (electrocardiograma), ECHO (ecocardiograma)." The legal disclosure paragraphs are dense and use formal Spanish legal register, which may be challenging for patients with lower literacy.

**Delivery options:** Four options are presented: "Retiro o Envío por correo postal o Fax o Correo electrónico" (Pickup, Mail, Fax, or Email). The "circle" instruction for selecting among them is a print-era design artifact.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a **general authorization form** — it covers both patient access and third-party release. The "DIVULGACIÓN DE REGISTROS DE" / "ENVIAR REGISTROS A" (Release Records From / Send Records To) fields are open-ended, requiring patients to fill in both sender and recipient. There is no patient-access-specific pathway or simplified version for patients requesting their own records. Purpose options include "Motivos personales" (personal reasons) alongside "Legal," "Seguro médico" (insurance), "Transferencia de atención médica" (transferring care), and "Continuidad de la atención" (continuity of care).

**HIPAA Right of Access:** The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access by name. It does state: "Entiendo que tengo el derecho de inspeccionar y hacer una copia de la información que se va a divulgar" — affirming the right to inspect and copy, which aligns with HIPAA's right of access language without citing the regulation.

**EHI Export / Bulk data:** No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or bulk data options.

**Format options for electronic delivery:** The form mentions email as a delivery option. It also notes that "Las imágenes o los registros electrónicos (por ejemplo, estudios de radiología) en medios CD/USB no están cifrados ni protegidos con contraseña" (electronic images/records on CD/USB media are not encrypted or password-protected). Secure email is not explicitly mentioned on the form itself, though the retrieval notes indicate the website mentions "secure email" as an option.

**Scope control:** Patients can specify date ranges ("Fechas de servicio/tratamiento (DEBE especificar el rango de fechas)") and select specific record types via checkboxes. This is good granularity.

**Language accessibility:** The existence of this Spanish translation is itself a patient-centeredness feature. The bilingual title helps patients confirm they have the right document.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** "Esta autorización vencerá el: ___. (Predeterminado: 6 meses)" — 6-month default expiration. This is reasonable under HIPAA, which requires either an expiration date or event.

**Voluntariness statement:** Present — "Entiendo que autorizar el uso y la divulgación de la información que se especifica arriba es voluntario. El tratamiento de atención médica, el pago, la inscripción en un plan de salud o la elegibilidad para los beneficios no están condicionados a firmar la autorización."

**Revocation rights:** Clearly stated — must be in writing, presented to HIM department.

**Photo ID:** "Entiendo que es posible que se requiera una identificación con fotografía para obtener informes médicos." The "es posible que se requiera" (may be required) language is softer than a hard requirement.

**Witness requirement:** Notably **absent** from this September 2025 version. The older April 2023 English versions (forms 1 and 2) included "**Witness signature is required below**" with a dedicated witness signature line. The current version (form 4 English and form 5 Spanish) has removed this requirement — a positive compliance change.

**Fees:** Not mentioned on the form itself. The retrieval notes indicate the website mentions a $6.50 flat fee for certain requests.

**Re-disclosure warning:** Present, with appropriate distinction between general health information (may be re-disclosed) and sensitive medical information (requires specific consent for re-disclosure).

**Restriction on existing records:** "Esta autorización solo es válida para los registros existentes. Los servicios futuros necesitarán una nueva autorización." This is a standard limitation.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo in the title:** The form title reads "Autorización de BHS para la divulgación de información **médicac**" — an extra "c" appended to "médica." This is a production error that appears in the official current version of the form (ID: 18929997, dated 09/2025). This typo in the document title undermines confidence in the quality of the translation.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish-language availability:** Blessing Hospital is a community hospital in Quincy, IL — not a major metro area — yet provides a current, professionally translated Spanish version of its ROI form. This is linked directly alongside the English version on the Medical Records page. Many larger organizations do not offer this.
- **Removal of witness requirement:** The September 2025 revision removed the witness signature requirement that was present in the April 2023 versions. This reduces a barrier that is not required by HIPAA for patient-initiated requests.
- **Bilingual title:** The title includes both Spanish and English names ("Autorización de BHS para la divulgación de información médica / BHS Authorization for Release of Medical Information"), helping patients confirm document identity.
- **Page 2 guidelines:** The "Pautas para completar" section provides field-by-field instructions in Spanish, reducing confusion for patients filling out the form.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **General form for all purposes:** The form does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records (HIPAA Right of Access) and a third-party authorization. A Spanish-speaking patient simply wanting their own records must navigate the same "DIVULGACIÓN DE REGISTROS DE" / "ENVIAR REGISTROS A" fields designed for inter-provider transfers, which may be confusing.
- **"Encierre en un círculo" instructions on a non-fillable PDF:** The form instructs patients to "circle" options for delivery method and call-back preference, but as a flat PDF with no fillable fields, this instruction only works for printed copies. A patient trying to complete this digitally has no interactive mechanism.
