# Blessing Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Blessing Hospital (part of Blessing Health System)
- **Location:** Quincy, IL
- **Website:** https://www.blessinghealth.org

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Blessing Hospital Quincy IL "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links to multiple versions of the ROI form.
2. **Web search** for `Blessing Hospital Quincy IL "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same URLs and found the medical records page.
3. **Web search** for `site:blessinghealth.org authorization release medical records` — found the medical records page and additional form URLs including Spanish version.
4. **Navigated website** at https://www.blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords — found the current (September 2025) versions of the English and Spanish forms linked directly from the Medical Records page. The page is well-organized under For Patients > Request Medical Records.

## Difficulties
- The Spanish form URL found via web search (older version) returned an HTML page instead of a PDF. The current 9-2025 Spanish version downloaded successfully.
- Multiple versions of the same form exist at different URLs (April 2023, undated older version, September 2025).
