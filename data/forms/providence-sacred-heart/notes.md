# Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center Spokane "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately returned a direct link to the Authorization for Disclosure PDF and the dedicated medical records page.
2. **Web search** for `Providence Health Services "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF download` — confirmed the parent system (Providence Health & Services) has a centralized medical records authorization portal at providence.org.
3. **Navigated the medical records page** at `https://www.providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/medical-records-wa/sacred-heart` — found two English forms and two Spanish versions, plus links to amendment, accounting of disclosures, and restriction/revocation forms.

## What Worked

The first web search was sufficient. Providence has a well-organized, facility-specific medical records page with direct PDF download links. No bot blocking or login walls encountered.
