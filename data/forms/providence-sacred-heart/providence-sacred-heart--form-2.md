## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **patient-specific HIPAA Right of Access form** — a "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set." It is distinct from form-1.pdf, which is the general "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" form used for third-party releases. The two forms serve complementary purposes: form-1 authorizes disclosure *to others*, while form-2 is for patients requesting *their own* records.

The form is branded to Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center specifically, with the facility's mailing address ("105 W. Eighth Ave. Suite 332-C, Spokane, WA 99204"), phone number ("(509) 474-3082"), fax ("(509) 474-4815"), and email ("PSHMC.HIMRecords@Providence.org"). It is published under the parent system's centralized medical records portal, with the URL path `wa-sacred-heart-access-designated-record-set.pdf` clearly identifying it as the Washington / Sacred Heart / access-to-records form. The medical records page also offers Spanish-language versions of both forms, plus additional forms for amendments, accounting of disclosures, and restriction/revocation requests.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Excellent.** Per the retrieval notes, the first web search immediately returned a direct link to Providence's medical records page. The facility-specific page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/medical-records-wa/sacred-heart` provides clearly labeled download links for both forms. No bot blocking, login walls, or patient portal gatekeeping was encountered.

The URL structure is descriptive and hierarchical (`/roi/wa-sacred-heart-access-designated-record-set.pdf`), making it identifiable even outside the context of the web page. The filename itself distinguishes this form from the general authorization form. The form was findable in a single web search and one click to download — effectively the best-case scenario.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Strong digital-first design.** The PDF has a full text layer (not a scan), 3,057 characters of extractable text across 2 pages. It contains **45 fillable form fields**, which is notably more than form-1's 37 fields. This is a high field count for a 2-page form, suggesting comprehensive interactive coverage of the form's input areas (patient demographics, recipient info, delivery method, facility selection, date ranges, record types).

Technical details:
- **File size**: 841,333 bytes (~841 KB) — somewhat large for a 2-page text-based PDF. The 23 fonts and 2 embedded images contribute to this. Not problematic for modern connections but larger than expected.
- **Text layer**: Yes, fully extractable
- **Fillable fields**: 45 (field names not enumerated in metadata but count is high)
- **Fonts**: 23 (a large number; possibly indicates rich formatting or font subsetting)
- **Embedded images**: 2 (likely logos or decorative elements)
- **Image-only scan**: No — this is a natively digital document

One notable limitation: the signature fields instruct the user to "Print form and sign by hand," which undermines the otherwise digital-first approach. The form cannot be completed entirely electronically despite having 45 fillable fields.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Well-organized 2-page layout.** Page 1 contains instructional/informational text (submission instructions, privacy notices, language assistance); page 2 is the actual form with input fields.

**Clarity of instructions**: The opening text is helpful, noting that "Providence Health & Services and Affiliates may store patient records separately for hospitals" and offering to "fax a copy of this form to other facilities upon request." This practical guidance addresses a real pain point for patients seen at multiple Providence facilities. The text also directs users who need records for deceased patients to contact the Central ROI Department for additional documentation — a sensible workflow.

**Record type options**: The form offers a granular checklist of record types:
- History & Physical
- Operative Report
- Diagnostic Report (lab, x-ray, EKG, etc.)
- Discharge Summary
- Emergency Department Report
- Progress Notes
- "Last 2 years only" (a scope limiter)
- Other (specify)

This gives patients meaningful control over what they receive.

**Delivery format options**: Five choices are offered — "MyChart," "Email," "Paper," "Disc," "Fax" — presented as checkboxes. This is a strong set of options, including both electronic and physical delivery.

**Date range**: The form includes a "For the range of dates from: ___ to: ___" field, allowing temporal scoping.

**Language**: The form uses reasonably plain language. The informational text on page 1 is somewhat dense but not excessively legalistic. The liability release paragraph ("The facility, its employees, officers and physicians are hereby released from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure of the above information") is boilerplate but potentially intimidating to patients.

**Non-discrimination and language assistance**: The form includes a non-discrimination notice and language assistance notices in English, Spanish, and Chinese, with a toll-free phone number and TTY access.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**This form is specifically designed for patient access to their own records**, which is exactly what HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) envisions. The title "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" uses the correct HIPAA terminology ("designated record set"). The form's existence as a distinct document separate from the general third-party authorization form (form-1) demonstrates that Providence understands the difference between patient access and third-party release.

**Scope options**: Patients can select specific record types, date ranges, and specific facilities/providers. The "Last 2 years only" checkbox is a practical convenience option.

**Delivery format**: Five options (MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, Fax) represent strong electronic delivery support. MyChart integration is particularly noteworthy — it meets patients where they likely already have an account.

**Recipient flexibility**: The form defaults to "Myself at the address above" but also allows specifying "the following recipient," accommodating patients who want records sent to a new provider or other party. This dual-purpose design is practical.

**What's missing**: The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or patient rights language. There is no statement informing patients of their right to receive records, the required response timeline (30 days), or their right to appeal a denial. There is no mention of electronic health information (EHI) export or bulk data access under the 21st Century Cures Act / ONC information blocking rules.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fees**: The form states "Fees may be associated with this request" but does not specify amounts or reference the HIPAA-permitted fee structure (cost-based fees for patient access requests). The vagueness is neither unusual nor ideal — patients cannot assess potential costs before submitting.

**Signature requirement**: The form requires a wet signature ("Print form and sign by hand"), which is a barrier to fully electronic submission. However, it does accept fax and email submission (the facility provides both fax and email addresses), so the form can be submitted remotely after printing and signing.

**No notarization requirement**: The form does not require notarization or witnesses.

**No expiration clause**: Unlike form-1 (which expires in 180 days), this patient access form contains no expiration language, which is appropriate — a request for one's own records does not need an expiration.

**Representative access**: The form includes fields for "Representative Name," "Relation to Patient," and "Representative Signature" with a note to "Please include supporting documentation." This appropriately accommodates personal representatives without creating excessive barriers.

**Liability release language**: The form includes "The facility, its employees, officers and physicians are hereby released from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure of the above information to the extent indicated and authorized herein." This language is unusual on a patient access form (more typical of third-party release forms) and may give patients pause, though it does not constitute an actionable barrier.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated patient access form**: Providence maintains a separate "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" distinct from their general third-party authorization form. Many organizations use a single form for both purposes, which muddies the patient experience. This separation demonstrates HIPAA literacy and patient-centered design.

- **Five delivery formats including MyChart**: Offering MyChart, Email, Paper, Disc, and Fax as delivery options is among the most comprehensive sets observed. MyChart integration is especially forward-thinking — patients with existing portal accounts can receive records electronically without additional setup.

- **Multi-facility awareness**: The text acknowledges that "Providence Health & Services and Affiliates may store patient records separately for hospitals" and offers to "fax a copy of this form to other facilities upon request." This is practical, transparent guidance that most health systems do not provide.

- **Centralized, well-organized portal**: The parent system's medical records page provides per-facility landing pages with clearly labeled form downloads, Spanish translations, and links to related forms (amendments, accounting of disclosures, restriction/revocation). This is a model for large health system form organization.

- **Language assistance**: Notices in English, Spanish, and Chinese with a toll-free number and TTY access.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Fees may be associated with this request"**: This vague statement gives patients no basis for estimating costs. Under HIPAA, fees for patient access must be reasonable and cost-based, but the form does not reference this standard or provide a fee schedule link. Patients may be deterred by uncertainty about potential charges.

- **"Some records are unavailable to receive via MyChart"**: This caveat appears without further explanation. Patients have no way to know which records are excluded from MyChart delivery or why, potentially leading to frustration if they select MyChart and receive only a partial response.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Liability release on a patient access form**: The statement "The facility, its employees, officers and physicians are hereby released from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure of the above information" is a legal release typically found on third-party authorization forms. Including it on a patient access form — where the patient is simply exercising their HIPAA right — is inappropriate and potentially coercive. It implies that accessing one's own records carries legal risk that the patient must assume.

- **Wet signature requirement despite 45 fillable fields**: The form has 45 interactive fillable fields but still requires patients to "Print form and sign by hand." This undermines the digital-first design. Under HIPAA, there is no requirement for a wet signature on a patient access request (as distinct from an authorization for third-party release, where a signature is required). Many organizations accept electronic or typed signatures for patient access requests.
