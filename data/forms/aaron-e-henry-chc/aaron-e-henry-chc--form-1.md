# Evaluation: Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is **not a Release of Information (ROI) form**. It is a "MISSISSIPPI CHILDREN'S HEALTH PROJECT PARENT/GUARDIAN CONSENT FORM" — a consent-to-treat form authorizing Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center (AEH) to provide medical, dental, and vision services to children through a mobile medical unit visiting schools. The form was the only downloadable PDF found during an extensive search; no actual ROI or medical records authorization form was located online for this organization.

The form is a 2-page fillable PDF (67,351 bytes) hosted on a third-party site (pcmac.org, the North Panola School District website), not on AEH's own website. It collects child demographics, health history, insurance information, and parental consent for school-based healthcare services.

Notably, item 7 of the consent section includes a release-of-information clause: "Release of my child's health information from AEHCHC to your child's school district upon request." This is a one-directional, bundled release embedded within the broader consent-to-treat — it is not a patient-initiated records access mechanism.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **extremely difficult to find** and was ultimately not discoverable through AEH's own web presence. The search notes document at least 10 targeted web searches, full site navigation, sitemap inspection, direct URL guessing, and Wayback Machine checks — none yielding an ROI form. The organization's website (aehchc.org) has no medical records page, no HIM section, and no downloadable patient forms (the "Patient Registration Forms" section contains only online web forms). The WordPress uploads directory returns 403 errors for all direct access attempts.

The form-1.pdf was found only through a broader web search that turned up a school district site (pcmac.org) hosting an AEH-branded consent form. A patient seeking to request their own medical records from AEH would find no guidance or forms online whatsoever. The source URL is long and non-descriptive: `http://images.pcmac.org/Uploads/NorthPanolaSD/NorthPanolaSD/Divisions/Forms/AEH-CONSENT%20FORM-%20rev%20June%202019%20re-revised%20(002)_Fillable_%7BSISE7D801F6F09B%7D.pdf`.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (6,446 characters). This is a natively digital document, not a scan.

**Fillable fields**: The metadata reports 63 fillable fields, though `fillable_field_names` is empty (field names were not extracted or are unnamed). A form with 63 interactive fields across 2 pages is heavily instrumented for digital completion.

**File format**: 67 KB for a 2-page PDF with 5 fonts and 1 embedded image — reasonably sized. The form includes a "(REV 5/19:ch;rdm)" revision tag, dating it to May/June 2019.

**Digital-first design**: The form appears designed for digital completion given the high fillable field count. It was clearly created as a PDF form (not scanned from paper), with structured layout and typed text throughout.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — appropriate for a consent-to-treat form that also collects health history. Page 1 covers child demographics, insurance, and provider information. Page 2 covers health history, family health history, and the consent/signature block.

**Clarity**: The opening uses accessible, encouraging language: "GREAT HEALTH MAKES GREAT MINDS!!!" and "It's tough for a child to pay attention and do well in school if he/she isn't healthy." The bullet points explaining benefits ("No long wait times," "No need to miss school or work," "Access to a healthcare provider") are clear and parent-friendly.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow — introduction → child information → health history → family history → consent. Section headers like "CHILD's INFORMATION," "CHILDS' HEALTH HISTORY," and "LEGAL GUARDIAN CONSENT AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT" provide clear structure.

**Layout concerns**: The form packs substantial content into 2 pages. The health history section uses a multi-column checklist format (chicken pox, frequent colds, seizures, etc.) that is functional but dense. The consent section at the bottom of page 2 lists 7 specific service categories — a reasonable level of specificity.

**Minor issues**: There is an apostrophe inconsistency ("CHILD's INFORMATION" on page 1 vs. "CHILDS' HEALTH HISTORY" on page 2). The form collects Social Security numbers for both the child and parent/guardian, which is notable from a data minimization standpoint.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**This form does not serve a patient trying to access their own health records.** It is a consent-to-treat form for school-based pediatric services. There is no mechanism for a patient (or parent/guardian) to request copies of records, specify record types or date ranges, choose a delivery format, or direct where records should be sent.

The embedded release clause (item 7: "Release of my child's health information from AEHCHC to your child's school district upon request") is a one-way, provider-to-school release — not a patient access pathway. It does not reference HIPAA § 164.524, patient rights, or any right-of-access framework.

The form does not mention electronic delivery options, EHI export, or any way to obtain records. The form provides phone numbers — "(662) 645-6008 or (662) 624-4292" — but these are for questions about the school-based health program, not for medical records requests.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Records release bundling**: Item 7 bundles a release of the child's health information to the school district into the overall consent-to-treat form. A parent cannot consent to treatment without also consenting to the information release. This is a form of consent bundling — though it may be permissible under the school health program's framework, it does not give the parent/guardian a separate choice on the release component.

**SSN collection**: The form requests Social Security numbers for the child, parent/guardian, and insured person. While SSNs may be needed for insurance billing, collecting the child's SSN as a required field raises data minimization concerns.

**Signature requirement**: "Must be signed in order to be seen" — this is appropriate for a consent-to-treat form but is stated as an absolute gate to receiving services.

**No mention of HIPAA**: The form contains no HIPAA authorization language, no privacy notice reference, and no statement of patient rights. For a consent-to-treat form, a HIPAA authorization may not be required, but the bundled information release to the school district (item 7) arguably constitutes a use/disclosure that would benefit from clearer HIPAA framing.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Bundled information release without opt-out**: The consent form bundles authorization to release the child's health information to the school district (item 7) with consent to receive treatment. There is no separate checkbox or opt-out for this release. A parent who wants their child to receive medical services must also consent to information sharing with the school district.

- **No ROI form available online**: Aaron E. Henry CHC has no discoverable mechanism for patients to request their own medical records online. The organization's website offers no forms, no instructions, and no guidance for records access — effectively requiring patients to visit or call to even begin the process.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Scope of school release is undefined**: Item 7 authorizes release "upon request" but does not specify what information will be shared, who at the school district may request it, or for what purposes. The phrase "your child's health information" is maximally broad.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Apostrophe inconsistency**: "CHILD's INFORMATION" (page 1) vs. "CHILDS' HEALTH HISTORY" (page 2) — neither form is grammatically correct for the intended possessive ("Child's").

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Strong fillable field support**: With 63 fillable fields across 2 pages, the form is well-instrumented for digital completion — an unusually high level of interactivity for a community health center form.

- **Plain-language opening**: The introductory section uses accessible, encouraging language that clearly explains the program's benefits and eliminates financial concerns ("NO Out-of-Pocket COST," "no co-pays/deductibles and no bill will be sent home"). This is effective parent-facing communication.
