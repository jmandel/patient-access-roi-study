# Evaluation: The Iowa Clinic — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a single-page "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF INFORMATION FROM THE IOWA CLINIC P.C." — a general-purpose authorization form for disclosing patient medical records to a specified recipient. It is a third-party release form, not a patient-access-specific form; the opening language reads: "I, as the patient or patient's legal representative, authorize The Iowa Clinic, P.C. or affiliate of The Iowa Clinic to disclose, release and deliver confidential medical information according to this Authorization."

Two PDF forms were found for this organization, both archived from the Wayback Machine. Form-1 is described in notes as the "newer/updated version" (archived 2015), while form-2 is an older version dated October 2012 with a dedicated second page for sensitive-information authorization. Form-1 condenses the sensitive-information consent into a single inline section using opt-out initials rather than a separate page. The current Iowa Clinic website no longer offers downloadable PDF forms at all — all records requests now route through online platforms (Swellbox/Datavant, Formstack, SmartRequest).

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Not findable on the current website.** The form was only retrievable via the Wayback Machine at `https://web.archive.org/web/2015/http://www.iowaclinic.com/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf`. The original URL (`/static/docs/Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf`) returns 404 on the live site. Multiple search strategies were attempted — `site:iowaclinic.com` searches, `filetype:pdf` queries, direct URL probing — none surfaced a current downloadable PDF.

The organization's medical records page (https://www.iowaclinic.com/for-patients/payment-billing/medical-records/) exists and is navigable, but it directs patients to third-party web form platforms rather than providing a downloadable authorization form. This means the PDF form under evaluation is purely historical context; it is not currently available to patients. The filename `Authorization_For_Release_From.pdf` is somewhat descriptive but truncates "From" oddly (likely should be "From_The_Iowa_Clinic").

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present. Full text is cleanly extractable (4,527 characters), not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (0). The PDF has no interactive form fields despite having fill-in blanks throughout. All fields are static underscored lines that would require printing and handwriting or using a PDF annotation tool.
- **Page count:** 1 page.
- **File size:** 69,082 bytes (~67 KB) — appropriate for a single-page text-based form.
- **Font count:** 4 fonts, suggesting some typographic hierarchy.
- **Embedded images:** 0 — pure text/vector layout.
- **Digital-first design:** Partially. The document was created digitally (not a scan), with a text layer and clean layout. However, the lack of fillable fields means it functions as a print-and-fill document. It mentions fax (515-875-9600) and mail as submission methods, reinforcing a paper-centric workflow: "Please fax to: 515-875-9600 or mail to: The Iowa Clinic Support Services, 6800 Lake Dr., Ste 270, West Des Moines, IA 50266."

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** One page — concise and appropriately sized for the content. The form packs patient information, record-type selection, destination, purpose, rights disclosures, sensitive-information opt-outs, and signature into a single page without excessive cramming.

**Organization:** The layout follows a logical flow: (1) title and introductory authorization language, (2) patient information fields, (3) two-column section pairing "specific records you want sent" with "send records to" address, (4) purpose-of-release checkboxes, (5) three disclosure paragraphs (expiration/revocation, conditioning of treatment, redisclosure warning), (6) electronic transmission authorization, (7) sensitive-information opt-out by category, (8) signature block, (9) submission instructions and fee notice.

**Record type checkboxes:** The form offers 8 record-type options: Billing records, Operative report, Lab data, Discharge summary, EKG, Radiology reports, History & physical, Radiology films & images, Complete record, and Other — providing reasonable granularity for specifying scope.

**Clarity:** Language is a mix of plain and semi-legal. The disclosure paragraphs are reasonably readable but use some dense constructions, e.g.: "I understand that the person or entity that receives the information requested may not be covered by the federal privacy regulations or is not an individual or entity who has signed an agreement with a covered person or entity and the medical information may no longer be protected by the regulations."

**Purpose options:** Six pre-printed purposes plus "Other": Transferring medical care, Insurance coverage, Case coordination/referral, Moving, Legal purposes, Request by patient. Including "Request by patient" as a purpose option is notable — it acknowledges patient-initiated requests explicitly.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is fundamentally a third-party release/disclosure authorization form. The structure assumes records will be sent from The Iowa Clinic to a named recipient. There is no pathway for a patient to simply request a copy of their own records for themselves without naming a third-party destination — though the form does allow "Send to address above" (the patient's own address) as a checkbox, which partially addresses patient access. The "Request by patient" purpose option further supports this use case.

**Scope options:** Patients can select specific record types (8 checkbox options plus "Other" and "Complete record"), specify service dates, and name the specific physician/provider whose records they need. Date range is supported via a single field: "Specific records you want sent with service dates."

**Format options:** The form states "Records may be provided in electronic form on a secure disk. Paper records are available upon request." This offers two format options, though neither is a modern electronic delivery method (no patient portal download, no secure email to patient).

**Rights information:** The form mentions the right to inspect disclosed information ("I understand I have the right to inspect the information to be disclosed upon the proper notification") and the right to revoke authorization. It does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or patient access rights specifically. There is no mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

**SSN collection:** The form requests Social Security Number, which is not required for records release and raises privacy concerns.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration:** "This authorization is effective for one year from the date on which it is signed." One year is a standard and reasonable expiration period.

**Revocation rights:** Stated clearly: "I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time, except to the extent that action has already been taken in reliance upon it."

**Conditioning of treatment:** The form includes appropriate language: "The Iowa Clinic does not require completion of this form as a condition of evaluation or treatment," with a reasonable exception for third-party report services.

**Fees:** The form notes "The Iowa Clinic charges a cost-based fee for the copying and releasing of medical records" but does not specify the amount. The language "cost-based fee" aligns with HIPAA requirements.

**Electronic transmission liability waiver:** The form includes a blanket liability waiver for fax/email errors: "If any portion of the fax/e-mail is received by an inappropriate third party in error, I release The Iowa Clinic, its physicians and staff of any and all liability relating to the disclosure of said records." This is a broad waiver that patients must accept to have records sent electronically.

**Sensitive information handling:** Uses an opt-out model — substance abuse, genetics, mental health, and AIDS-related information will be included unless the patient initials specific categories to deny release. This is a reasonable approach but differs from form-2's more detailed opt-in model with specific authorization checkboxes.

**Submission methods:** Fax and mail only. No online submission option is mentioned on the form itself (though the organization has since moved to web-based submission).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **SSN collection:** The form requests "SSN" (Social Security Number) as a patient identification field. SSN is not required to process a records release request, and collecting it creates unnecessary identity theft risk. This exceeds what is needed for patient identification under HIPAA.

- **Blanket electronic transmission liability waiver:** The clause "I release The Iowa Clinic, its physicians and staff of any and all liability relating to the disclosure of said records" shifts all risk of misdirected fax/email to the patient. A covered entity retains obligations to safeguard PHI during transmission regardless of patient waivers.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Send to address above" checkbox ambiguity:** The form offers "Send to address above" and "Send records to the below" as radio-style options, but it's unclear whether "address above" refers to the patient's home address (enabling self-request) or is intended for situations where the requesting entity's address matches a previously entered field. The form structure suggests patient address, but the form's overall framing as a disclosure authorization to third parties creates uncertainty.

- **Sensitive information opt-out scope:** The opt-out section states "Please initial beside any category you do NOT want to be released" — a negative-consent model where silence equals consent to release. This can confuse patients who may not read carefully and inadvertently authorize release of sensitive categories. Form-2's opt-in approach (requiring affirmative "YES" or "NO") is clearer.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **"Request by patient" as an explicit purpose option:** Including this alongside third-party purposes acknowledges patient-initiated access as a legitimate use of the form, even though the form is primarily designed for third-party disclosure.

- **Concise single-page design:** Fitting all necessary authorization elements — patient info, record selection, destination, purpose, rights disclosures, sensitive-info handling, and signature — onto a single page is efficient and reduces burden compared to multi-page forms.

- **Electronic format mention:** The note that "Records may be provided in electronic form on a secure disk" shows awareness of electronic access options, though the specific medium (secure disk) is dated.
