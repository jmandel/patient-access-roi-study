# Barnes-Jewish Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Barnes-Jewish Hospital
- **Location:** St. Louis, MO
- **Website:** https://www.barnesjewish.org
- **Parent System:** BJC HealthCare
- **Type:** Teaching hospital, nonprofit, major system (affiliated with Washington University School of Medicine)

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search** for `Barnes-Jewish Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found references to the form on cocodoc.com and bjc.org.
2. **Web search** for `Barnes-Jewish Hospital "medical records" "release form" PDF` — found official Barnes-Jewish Hospital medical records page and references to recdep.com (third-party records service).
3. **Web search** for `site:barnesjewish.org authorization release medical records` — found direct BJC-hosted PDF and confirmed the official Medical Records Requests page.
4. **Navigated directly** to https://www.barnesjewish.org/Patients-Visitors/Medical-Records-Requests — this was the definitive source, listing multiple forms with clear download links.

## What Worked
The official Barnes-Jewish Hospital website has a well-organized "Medical Records Requests" page under Patient & Visitor Information. It clearly distinguishes between:
- **Individual requests** (patients requesting their own records)
- **Third-party requests** (requesting records be sent to another party)
- **Next of Kin requests** (for deceased patients)
- **Amendment requests** (correcting records)

All forms are directly linked as PDFs — no login or portal required.

- **Document type:** Authorization for Release of Information (general/third-party)
- **Description:** This is the general ROI form — "Authorization For Release Of Information" — for authorizing Barnes-Jewish Hospital to release records to a third party (physician, institution, agency).

## Difficulties Encountered
- None significant. The official website has a clearly organized Medical Records Requests page with direct PDF download links.
- Barnes-Jewish Hospital distinguishes between individual patient access and third-party release, which is a good practice — they provide separate forms for each use case.
- The page also mentions that Washington University maintains separate medical records for patients seen at WashU Clinics, which could be confusing for patients.
