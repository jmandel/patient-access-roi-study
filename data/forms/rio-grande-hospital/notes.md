# Rio Grande Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Rio Grande Hospital
- **Location:** Del Norte, CO
- **Website:** https://riograndehospital.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Rio Grande Hospital Del Norte Colorado "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — did not return the direct PDF but pointed to the hospital website.
2. **Web search** with `site:riograndehospital.org medical records release authorization form` — found three key URLs:
   - Hospital Patient Records Release Form page
   - Clinic Authorization for Release of Information page
   - Direct PDF download link
3. **HTML inspection** of both the hospital and clinic records release pages to identify embedded forms and PDF links.

## What Was Found

Rio Grande Hospital provides two pathways for medical records release authorization:

1. **Downloadable PDF form** — A single-page "Authorization for Release of Information" PDF available at a direct URL. This is the same PDF linked from both the hospital and clinic pages.
2. **Online JotForm submissions** — Both the hospital page and clinic page embed different HIPAA-compliant JotForms for online submission:
   - Hospital JotForm ID: 220685534838162
   - Clinic JotForm ID: 220685679526166

The hospital and clinic pages also link to additional patient forms (Patient Information Form, Consent Form, Privacy Policy, etc.) but those are not ROI forms.

Includes office-use-only section for tracking fax/mail/release.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The PDF was directly downloadable and the website clearly organizes its patient forms.
- The hospital and clinic pages primarily feature embedded JotForms for online submission rather than downloadable PDFs; the downloadable PDF is in the sidebar.
- Only one PDF version of the ROI form exists — the same form is shared between hospital and clinic contexts.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The form was findable via web search and clearly linked from the hospital website's patient forms pages.
