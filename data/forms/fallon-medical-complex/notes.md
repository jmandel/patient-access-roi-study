# Fallon Medical Complex — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Fallon Medical Complex
- **Location:** Baker, MT 59313
- **Website:** https://www.fallonmedical.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search** for `Fallon Medical Complex Baker MT "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — did not return direct PDF results but confirmed the organization exists.
2. **Web search** for `Fallon Medical Complex Baker Montana medical records release form` — successfully identified the Information Management page at https://www.fallonmedical.org/information-management with links to three downloadable forms.
3. **Website navigation** — the Information Management page is directly accessible and clearly lists patient forms under a "Patient Forms" section. Three documents are linked.

Explicitly notes it does not authorize release of copies (requires the separate form-1).

### form-3.pdf

## Difficulties
- The primary release form (form-1) is published as a .doc file rather than PDF. It was converted to PDF using LibreOffice for consistency with the study format. The original .doc is also retained.
- No difficulties with access — all forms were publicly available without bot blocking or login walls.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
The forms were found within 2 searches and were directly linked from the organization's Information Management page.
