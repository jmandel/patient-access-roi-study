## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is the primary Release of Information authorization form for Fallon Medical Complex. It is a 2-page general-purpose authorization covering both patient access to their own records and third-party disclosure. It was published on the organization's Information Management page as a Microsoft Word .doc file (not a PDF), and was converted to PDF via LibreOffice for this study. The original .doc is also retained as form-1.doc.

Fallon Medical Complex publishes two other documents alongside this form: a one-page "Verbal Release of Information" form (form-2.pdf) for authorizing phone-based disclosure to specific individuals, and a three-page "Notice of Privacy Practices" (form-3.pdf). The verbal release form explicitly notes that obtaining copies of records requires the separate form-1. Together, the three documents represent a coherent but minimal document suite for a small critical access hospital.

The form is dated "09/06/2023" per the footer ("FMCCAH-ReleaseofInformation 09/06/2023 dmh"), suggesting a relatively recent revision.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, the form was located within two web searches and was directly linked from the organization's Information Management page at https://www.fallonmedical.org/information-management. The page is described as clearly listing patient forms. No login wall, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking was encountered.

However, the actual download link points to a Google Cloud Storage bucket (`storage.googleapis.com/cardsetter-tmp-user-assets/fallon-medical/...`), which is unusual — the URL structure ("cardsetter-tmp-user-assets") suggests a website builder's temporary asset storage rather than a permanent document management system. The form file is also named with a somewhat cryptic pattern: `FMCCAH-ReleaseofInformation 09062023 dmh (002).doc`.

The retrieval difficulty was rated "Easy" overall. For a small rural critical access hospital, having forms publicly accessible and linkable from a clearly labeled page is commendable.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Format concerns:** The form is published as a `.doc` file (Microsoft Word 97-2003 format), not a PDF. This is a significant accessibility issue. Many patients may not have Microsoft Word or compatible software. Mobile devices and Chromebooks may not render .doc files reliably. The form required conversion to PDF via LibreOffice for this study, and conversion fidelity may not be guaranteed for all users' tools.

**No fillable fields:** The metadata reports `fillable_field_count: 0`. This means even the converted PDF is a flat document — patients cannot fill it electronically. They must print, hand-write, and physically deliver or scan/fax the completed form. This is a significant barrier for remote or digitally-oriented patients, particularly given that Baker, MT is a small, geographically isolated community where distance to the facility may be substantial.

**Text layer:** The document does have an extractable text layer (5,231 characters), meaning it is not an image-only scan. Text is selectable and searchable, which aids in accessibility for screen readers — though the .doc-to-PDF conversion may compromise structured reading order.

**Font count:** 5 fonts are used, which is moderate and not problematic.

**Embedded images:** 2 images are present, likely a logo or header graphic.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Layout and structure:** The form is organized in a logical top-to-bottom flow across two pages: patient demographics → release from/to → purpose → information types → date range → disclosure format → sensitive information handling → patient access terms → legal disclosures → signatures. This is a reasonable layout that follows a natural completion sequence.

**Purpose field:** Offers four checkbox options — "Continuation of Care," "Personal," "Insurance/WC," "Legal," and "Other (specify)" — which appropriately covers common use cases and includes "Personal" as a purpose, which is important for patient-initiated access requests.

**Information types:** The form provides 10 checkbox categories for records to release, ranging from specific ("Emergency Report/Records," "Laboratory," "EKG") to broad ("Entire Medical Record"). This gives patients meaningful granularity in specifying what they want.

**Disclosure format options:** The form offers an unusually comprehensive set of delivery methods:
- Paper format — US Mail
- Electronic — USB Drive/Disc
- Electronic Fax
- Review Only
- Paper format — Pick up
- Email unsecure/unencrypted (with risk acknowledgment)
- Patient Portal Access (with email for login setup)

This is a notably wide range of options for a small critical access hospital.

**Sensitive information handling:** The form includes two parallel sections for sensitive categories (behavioral/mental health, abuse, sickle cell anemia, AIDS/HIV, substance use, genetic testing, STDs). The first section authorizes release of checked categories; the second specifies categories to be excluded. Both require initials for substance use. While this dual-section approach provides granularity, it is potentially confusing — a patient might not understand why they need to engage with both sections, or might check boxes in the wrong section.

**Plain language:** The form uses a mix of professional and accessible language. The patient access section uses first-person "I will" statements that read as patient commitments rather than informational statements, which is an unusual rhetorical framing (e.g., "I will submit a copy of a picture ID if requesting information by fax, mail, or email").

**Legal disclosures:** The "I Understand That" section covers authorization expiry (1 year), revocation rights, redisclosure risks, 42 CFR Part 2 protections, treatment non-conditioning, and right to inspect under §164.524. This is fairly comprehensive but dense.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Dual-purpose form:** The form serves both patient access (Right of Access under HIPAA) and third-party release purposes. It does not distinguish clearly between these two very different use cases. A patient simply wanting their own records must navigate the same form as someone authorizing disclosure to an insurer or attorney. The "Release From" and "Release To" fields assume a sender/receiver model that may not intuitively map to "I want my own records."

**Fee language:** The form states: "I may review my medical record without a charge. If I request copies of my medical record, I may receive the first copy without a charge, additional copies may be charged." Offering the first copy free and free review access is patient-friendly and consistent with HIPAA's requirement for reasonable cost-based fees.

**Photo ID requirement:** The form requires: "I will submit a copy of a picture ID if requesting information by fax, mail, or email" and "I will provide a picture ID prior to accessing my medical record." Identity verification is reasonable, but requiring a photo ID copy for every request method could be a barrier for patients who lack government-issued photo ID.

**Supervised review:** The statement "A HIM professional will supervise the review of my medical record" implies that in-person review of one's own records requires staff supervision, which may feel intrusive or paternalistic.

**Patient portal option:** Including patient portal access as a delivery option, with a simple instruction ("You will be sent a link to get signed up"), is a forward-looking approach that acknowledges digital health infrastructure.

**Email option with informed consent:** The form offers unencrypted email delivery with a clear risk statement: "Health Information sent via unencrypted email may place risk of inappropriate access to the information contained within the email." It requires patient initials to accept this risk. This respects patient autonomy while ensuring informed consent.

---

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiry:** The form defaults to a 1-year expiry, with an option for the patient to request a shorter period. This is reasonable and common.

**Revocation rights:** Clearly stated — "I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time, except to the extent that action has already been taken to comply with it."

**Treatment non-conditioning:** The form explicitly states: "Fallon Medical Complex will not condition treatment on whether the individual sign the authorization." This satisfies the HIPAA requirement.

**42 CFR Part 2 reference:** The form references protections for substance use disorder records under 42 CFR Part 2, though the sentence contains a typographical error: "unless the disclosed includes records from a federally-assisted programs specifically **proving** diagnosis" (should be "**providing**").

**Redisclosure warning:** Present and adequately stated.

**Right to inspect:** References §164.524 of the Privacy Act, which is the correct HIPAA provision for patient access rights.

**Witness signature:** The form includes a "Witnessed Signature" field in the "For Office Use Only" section. This is for internal use and does not appear to be required of the patient.

**Authorized representative:** The form appropriately requires documentation of authority for representatives other than parents of minor children (e.g., Health Care Power of Attorney).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Supervised record review:** The statement "A HIM professional will supervise the review of my medical record" imposes a condition on in-person access that may discourage patients from exercising their right to review. While facilities may have legitimate security concerns, framing this as a requirement in the authorization form adds friction.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Dual sensitive-info sections are confusing.** The form has two nearly identical checkbox sections for sensitive information categories — one for information "to be released" and one for information that "may NOT be released." A patient could easily misread which section serves which purpose, especially since both sections use the same checkbox labels and both require substance-use initials. The difference is only apparent from the header text above each block.

- **"Release From" / "Release To" framing for patient access.** When a patient wants their own records, it's unclear how to fill in "Release From" and "Release To." Should a patient requesting their own records from Fallon Medical put Fallon Medical as "Release From" and themselves as "Release To"? The form doesn't guide this use case.

- **"*IF SENDING RECORDS TO FMC, PLEASE MAIL IF MORE THAN 20 PAGES"** — This note, placed between the Release To fields and the Purpose field, is confusing in context. It seems directed at other facilities sending records to Fallon Medical, but the patient completing the form may not understand who this instruction is for or what action it requires of them.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **"immunodefiency" misspelled** — appears twice in the form (should be "immunodeficiency"). Found in both the include and exclude sensitive-information sections.

- **"proving" should be "providing"** — in the 42 CFR Part 2 paragraph: "unless the disclosed includes records from a federally-assisted programs specifically **proving** diagnosis, treatment or referral for treatment of drug and alcohol abuse."

- **Published as .doc, not PDF** — The form is distributed as a Microsoft Word .doc file, which is a problematic format choice. Many users cannot reliably open .doc files, and the format does not preserve consistent rendering across platforms.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Comprehensive disclosure format options.** For a small rural critical access hospital, offering seven distinct delivery methods — including USB drive, patient portal, and unencrypted email with informed consent — is remarkably thorough and patient-accommodating.

- **First copy free.** The statement "I may receive the first copy without a charge" goes beyond what many larger facilities offer and reduces financial barriers to record access.

- **Patient portal access integrated into the ROI form.** Including portal signup as a disclosure format option is a practical bridge between paper-based authorization and digital health infrastructure.
