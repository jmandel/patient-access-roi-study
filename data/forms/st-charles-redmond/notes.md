# St. Charles Redmond — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** St. Charles Redmond
- **Website:** https://stcharleshealthcare.org/locations/st-charles-redmond
- **Parent System:** St. Charles Health System (regional system, 4 hospitals in Central Oregon)
- **Location:** Redmond, OR

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `St. Charles Redmond Oregon "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately surfaced the St. Charles Health System release of information page and direct PDF links.
2. **Web search** for `St. Charles Health System Oregon "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same page and additional older PDF URLs.
3. **Web search** for `site:stcharleshealthcare.org authorization release medical records` — provided further confirmation and additional form versions.
4. **Direct navigation** to https://stcharleshealthcare.org/patients/release-information — found the canonical release of information page with the currently-linked 2025 forms.

The form was easy to find. The release of information page is clearly linked and provides both English and Spanish versions of the authorization form. St. Charles uses a single ROI form across the entire health system (covering Bend, Redmond, Madras, and Prineville hospitals).

## Difficulties
- None significant. One older URL (from 2020) returned a 404, but the current forms downloaded without issues.
- St. Charles does not have a Redmond-specific ROI form — the system-wide form covers all locations with checkboxes for each hospital.

## Key Observations
- St. Charles provides a unified ROI form across all hospital locations in the system.
- The form is available in both English and Spanish.
- Forms are described as "fillable" in their filenames, indicating interactive PDF fields.
- Patients can also request records via MyChart (patient portal) for records from April 7, 2018 onward.
- The release of information page is well-organized with clear instructions for self-requests and third-party requests.
