## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3.pdf is the **current 2025 English version** of St. Charles Health System's unified "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. It is a 2-page fillable PDF (form number 3740, dated 1/25) used across the entire St. Charles system — Bend, Redmond, Madras, Prineville, Sage View, and the Center for Orthopedics and Neurosurgery.

Four forms were retrieved for this organization:
- **form-1.pdf**: Legacy 2016 version (form 3740, dated 4/16). Non-fillable, 0 interactive fields. No longer linked from the website.
- **form-2.pdf**: Intermediate 2022 fillable version (form 3740, dated 11/19 but filename references 10/2022). 64 fillable fields.
- **form-3.pdf** *(this document)*: Current 2025 English fillable version. 65 fillable fields.
- **form-4.pdf**: Current 2025 Spanish fillable version (form 3742, dated 2/25). 65 fillable fields. Equivalent content.

This is a **general-purpose authorization form** — it handles both patient-initiated requests ("Personal" purpose) and third-party disclosures (legal, insurance, continuation of care). It is not specifically a patient-access or Right of Access form; it is the same form regardless of who is requesting and why. St. Charles does not appear to have a separate, simplified patient-access-only request form.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was **easy to locate**. Per the retrieval notes, the first web search immediately surfaced the St. Charles ROI page. The canonical page at `https://stcharleshealthcare.org/patients/release-information` is clearly linked and provides direct PDF download links for both English and Spanish versions.

The URL filename is descriptive: `AuthorizationUseDisclosurePHI(ROI)-English 3740_2025-fillable.pdf` — it identifies the content, language, form number, year, and fillable nature. The form retrieval required minimal effort: web search or direct navigation to the "Release of Information" page under the Patients section. The notes describe the difficulty as essentially none.

The retrieval notes also confirm that patients can alternatively request records via MyChart for records from April 7, 2018 onward, giving patients a digital alternative beyond the PDF form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present. The full text (4,721 characters of actual content across 2 pages) is fully extractable via pdftotext. Not an image-only scan.

**Fillable fields:** 65 interactive form fields — a substantial number indicating comprehensive digitization of the form. This is a genuine fillable PDF, not a flat document. The field names array is empty in the metadata (likely unnamed fields), but the count indicates all checkboxes, text inputs, and signature areas have been implemented as interactive elements. This is a notable improvement over form-1.pdf (the 2016 version), which had 0 fillable fields.

**File format:** 335,801 bytes (328 KB) for a 2-page document. Somewhat large, likely due to 2 embedded images (probably the St. Charles logo) and 19 fonts. Reasonable but not lean.

**Digital-first design:** This form was clearly designed for digital completion — the filename explicitly includes "fillable," and the 65 interactive fields cover the full range of inputs. However, the form still requires a "WET-INK SIGNED" signature (quoted directly: "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED"), which means the patient must print, sign by hand, and then mail, fax, or deliver the form. This fundamentally undermines the digital-first design by forcing a physical step.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages. Appropriate for the scope of the form — page 1 covers patient demographics, sender/recipient, record types, and date range; page 2 covers sensitive records consent, legal disclosures, format/delivery options, and signature.

**Clarity:** The form uses moderately clear language. The "By signing this authorization form, I understand that:" section uses parenthetical plain-language clarifications, e.g., "I have the right to revoke (take back or change my mind about) this authorization at any time." This is a good practice. However, the overall structure is dense, with heavy use of checkboxes, numbered sections, and instructions interleaved with form fields.

**Organization:** The form uses numbered sections (1–10) with corresponding instructions at the bottom of each page. While the numbered references create a cross-referencing system, they also force the user to jump between the form body and the instruction blocks, which is cognitively taxing. Instructions 3 and 4 are identical text, which is confusing: both say "Check with the 'From' or 'To' box, then identify and provide the contact information for the sender or recipient of the medical records, as applicable."

**Layout:** The form packs considerable content into 2 pages. The sender/recipient section (section 4) is particularly dense, with two parallel columns — one for identifying St. Charles locations and one for external sender/recipient details. The radiology films section on page 1 includes a specific address for Central Oregon Radiology Associates (CORA), which adds operational detail that may confuse patients.

**Font/readability:** 19 fonts are embedded, suggesting varied formatting. The text extracted via pdftotext is legible and well-structured, though the document would benefit from more whitespace.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a **unified form** — the same document is used whether a patient is requesting their own records ("Personal" purpose checkbox) or authorizing release to a third party. There is no dedicated patient-access form. This means patients requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for a broader range of disclosure scenarios, including fields for sender/recipient that may not intuitively map to a simple "I want my records" request.

**Scope options:** Good granularity. Patients can select from:
- Any & All Records (complete legal Health Record)
- Visit Summary (with parenthetical detail: "Provider Notes, History & Physical, Operative Report, Discharge Summary, Diagnostics")
- Emergency Room Record
- Lab Report(s)
- Radiology Report(s)
- Cardiac Tests
- Itemized Billing Records
- Other (free text)
- Radiology films/imaging (with specific provider contact info)

Date range is also supported: "Date Range of Services: ___ to ___"

**Sensitive records:** Page 2 requires separate initials for release of Alcohol/Drug/Substance Abuse Records, HIV Testing Records, Mental Health Records, and Genetic Records. This is appropriate under 42 CFR Part 2 and state law.

**Format options:** Limited. The form offers:
- Paper (default)
- "Electronic Media (i.e. CD, Thumbdrive)"
- Note: "Record requests over 250 pages will be delivered using electronic media."

There is **no option for email, secure electronic delivery, or patient portal delivery** on this form. The only electronic option is physical media (CD or thumb drive). Fax is mentioned but only for provider-to-provider transfers: "Faxes are only sent to other healthcare providers offices. Anything over 30 pages will be mailed."

**Delivery options:** U.S. Mail or "Pick up (only at limited locations)." No electronic delivery pathway.

**Right of Access language:** The form does **not** reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. It references fees "in accordance with federal and state regulations" but does not explain what those limits are.

**EHI Export awareness:** No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or USCDI.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Wet-ink signature requirement:** The form explicitly states "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED" next to the signature line. This means electronic signatures are not accepted, which is a notable barrier. HIPAA does not require wet-ink signatures for patient access requests — indeed, HHS guidance has clarified that providers cannot impose unreasonable barriers, and requiring physical signatures when electronic alternatives exist may constitute such a barrier depending on context.

**Fees:** The form states "Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations" and repeats this for delivery options. It does not disclose specific fee amounts on the form itself. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, fees for patient-requested copies are limited to reasonable, cost-based fees, but the form gives patients no indication of what to expect.

**Expiration:** "Unless I revoke this authorization, it will expire on the following date or event: ___. If an expiration date is not specified, this authorization will expire one year from the date it is signed." A one-year default is standard and reasonable.

**Photo ID check:** The "For Office Use Only" section includes a "Photo ID checked" checkbox. While identity verification is permissible, the form does not clarify when or how ID must be presented, and whether pick-up vs. mail requests have different requirements.

**Right to reject:** "St. Charles reserves the right to reject this authorization form if the legal authority of the representative cannot be validated." This is appropriate for representative requests but could concern patients if applied overly broadly.

**No treatment conditioning:** The form includes the required statement: "No determination about treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will be based on whether or not I sign this authorization form."

**Minor consent provisions:** The instructions note specific Oregon-law protections for minors' substance abuse records (age 14+) and all medical records of minors age 15+, requiring the minor's written authorization if the minor self-consented to treatment.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Wet-ink signature mandate.** The form explicitly requires "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED," rejecting electronic signatures. This forces patients to print, hand-sign, and physically deliver or mail the form — a significant barrier that undermines the otherwise fillable digital design. HHS has cautioned providers against imposing unnecessary barriers on patient access requests; requiring wet ink when e-signatures are widely accepted may cross this line, particularly for patients with mobility limitations or those located far from St. Charles facilities.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Duplicate instructions.** Instructions 3 and 4 contain identical text: "Check with the 'From' or 'To' box, then identify and provide the contact information for the sender or recipient of the medical records, as applicable." The two sections on the form (left and right columns in section 4) serve different roles — one is the St. Charles location and the other is the external party — but the instructions fail to differentiate them.

- **"Pick up (only at limited locations)"** — the form does not specify which locations allow pick-up. A patient in Redmond has no way to know from the form whether they can pick up records locally or must travel to Bend (where HIM is headquartered at 2500 NE Neff Road).

- **Fee ambiguity.** "Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations" appears twice but no fee schedule is provided or referenced. Patients have no way to estimate cost before submitting. A footnote like "Additional fee's apply" (sic) for radiology imaging adds further uncertainty.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typographical error:** "Additional fee's apply" on page 1 — the apostrophe in "fee's" is incorrect (should be "fees").

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Bilingual availability.** The form is published in both English (form-3.pdf) and Spanish (form-4.pdf), both as current 2025 fillable versions. This is uncommon and serves the Central Oregon community well.

- **65 fillable fields.** The form is comprehensively digitized with interactive checkboxes and text fields, making it practical to fill on-screen before printing for signature. This is a meaningful improvement over many providers' flat PDFs.

- **Iterative improvement visible.** The progression from form-1.pdf (2016, 0 fillable fields) to form-2.pdf (2022, 64 fields) to form-3.pdf (2025, 65 fields) shows St. Charles is actively maintaining and improving this form over time.

- **MyChart alternative noted.** While not on the form itself, the retrieval notes confirm that the ROI webpage mentions patients can request records via MyChart for records from April 7, 2018 onward — providing a fully digital alternative pathway.

- **Plain-language parentheticals.** Legal concepts are glossed in plain English, e.g., "revoke (take back or change my mind about)" — a small but meaningful accessibility improvement.
