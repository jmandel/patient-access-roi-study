# Evaluation: ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA" — a general-purpose authorization for releasing patient health information to a named third party or at the patient's own request. It was originally a Microsoft Word `.doc` file hosted at `entandallergy.com/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc` and was converted to PDF for this study. Document metadata indicates the file was last edited in January 2009 by "Eric Bergman."

The only other document found for this organization (form-2.pdf) is a "Patient Acknowledgment Form – Allergy Form Completion Fee" — a $25-per-form fee acknowledgment unrelated to medical records release. Form-1 is therefore the sole ROI-relevant document available from this practice.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form is exceptionally difficult to find. Per the retrieval notes:

- **No patient forms page exists.** The website (entandallergy.com) has no "Patient Forms," "Medical Records," or "Request Your Records" section in its navigation.
- **Not linked from any visible page.** The `.doc` URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) appears to be an orphaned file — it is not reachable through any navigable link on the current website.
- **Only discoverable via web search.** The form was found through a targeted `filetype:doc` web search, not through the organization's own site.
- **The FAQ is unhelpful.** The website FAQ has an entry about medical records, but it only discusses retention policies, not how to request records or where to find the form.
- **Misleading footer link.** The footer contains an "Allergy Authorization Form" link that leads to the fee acknowledgment form (form-2), not the ROI form.

A patient navigating the website would have essentially no path to discovering this form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Original format:** Word `.doc` file — not a PDF, not a fillable form. This is an unusual and suboptimal format for patient-facing documents; many users cannot open `.doc` files, and it requires a word processor to complete.
- **Fillable fields:** 0. The document has no interactive form fields. Patients would need to print and hand-fill it, or type into the `.doc` template.
- **Text layer:** Yes — text is fully extractable (4,430 characters across 2 pages). No OCR issues.
- **Fonts:** 4 fonts used.
- **Embedded images:** 1 (likely a logo or header graphic).
- **File size:** ~130 KB — reasonable for a 2-page document.
- **Digital-first design:** No. This is a 2009-era Word document designed for printing. There is no electronic submission option, no email address for returning the form, and no indication the form can be completed digitally.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and structure:** The form is 2 pages with 13 numbered items, plus a footer note on HIV-related information. The length is proportionate to its content, though the dense paragraph format makes it feel longer than necessary.

**Language:** The form is written in moderately dense legal language. The opening paragraph — "I, or my authorized representative, request that health information regarding my care and treatment be released as set forth on this form. In accordance with New York and/or New Jersey State Law and the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), I understand that:" — is a long run-on sentence that sets a legalistic tone. The numbered items that follow are mostly comprehensible but include constructions like "except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization" that could challenge low-literacy readers.

**Layout:** The form uses a straightforward numbered list structure, but lacks visual hierarchy. There is minimal use of bold, headers, or section dividers to guide the eye. Item 6 uses ALL-CAPS for emphasis: "THIS AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT AUTHORIZE YOU TO DISCUSS MY HEALTH INFORMATION OR MEDICAL CARE WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN THEN ATTORNEY OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SPECIFIED IN ITEM 9(b)." This is jarring and contains a typo ("THEN" instead of "THE").

**Field design:** Fields for patient information (Name, DOB, SSN, Address) are listed at the top. Scope options use checkbox-style markers for "Medical Record from [date] to [date]," "Entire Medical Record," and "Other." The "Reason for release" section offers only two options: "At request of individual" and "Other."

**Information density:** Items 1-5 are boilerplate HIPAA/state-law disclosures. Items 6-13 are the operational portions. The ratio of disclosure text to actionable content is high, which may overwhelm patients.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This form is primarily designed as a third-party release authorization, not a patient-access request. The structure assumes records will be sent to a named recipient (Item 8: "Name and address of person(s) or category of person to whom this information will be sent"). A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient, which is not intuitive. There is no dedicated patient-access pathway or language referencing the right to obtain one's own records.

**Scope options:** The form offers three scope choices: records within a date range, the entire medical record (with a detailed description: "patient histories, office notes (except psychotherapy notes), test results, radiology studies, films, referrals, consults, billing records, insurance records, and records sent to you by other health care providers"), or an open-ended "Other" field. This is reasonably flexible.

**Delivery format:** No delivery format options are offered. There is no mention of electronic delivery, email, patient portal download, or any format preference. The form implicitly assumes paper/physical delivery.

**Special categories:** The form includes separate initialing lines for authorization to release Alcohol/Drug Treatment records, Mental Health Information, and HIV-Related Information — properly handling these sensitive categories under NY and NJ state law.

**Right of Access language:** The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 (the Right of Access provision) or explain patient rights to obtain their own records. Item 4 states "My treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned upon my authorization of this disclosure," which addresses anti-coercion but not access rights.

**SSN collection:** The form asks for the patient's Social Security Number in the header fields. This is an unnecessary data collection point for a records release request and raises privacy concerns.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **No fee disclosure:** The form does not mention any fees for records copies. While this avoids the problem of discouraging requests, it also means patients have no upfront information about potential costs.
- **Expiration:** Item 11 asks for a "Date or event on which this authorization will expire" — this is appropriate and gives the patient control. However, there is no default expiration if the patient leaves this blank, which could result in an indefinitely valid authorization.
- **No unreasonable procedural barriers:** The form does not require notarization, witnesses, or in-person submission. However, the lack of any submission instructions means patients have no guidance on how or where to return the completed form.
- **Anti-redisclosure notice:** Item 2 properly includes the required notice about redisclosure restrictions for HIV, substance abuse, and mental health information, including contact information for the NY Division of Human Rights, NYC Commission on Human Rights, and NJ Division on Civil Rights.
- **Item 6 restriction:** The all-caps statement in Item 6 restricts discussion of health information to only attorneys or governmental agencies specified in Item 9(b). This is an unusual and potentially confusing restriction — it implies the authorization does not permit general verbal discussion of the patient's care with the recipient, only written release, unless the recipient is an attorney or government agency.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Social Security Number requested.** The form header includes a "Social Security No." field. SSN collection is unnecessary for a records release request and creates a data security risk. HIPAA does not require SSN for identity verification in access requests.
- **Item 6 restricts discussion scope in a confusing way.** The all-caps statement — "THIS AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT AUTHORIZE YOU TO DISCUSS MY HEALTH INFORMATION OR MEDICAL CARE WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN THEN ATTORNEY OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SPECIFIED IN ITEM 9(b)" — could be read to mean the provider can only verbally discuss the patient's case with an attorney or government agency, not with the patient or their designated representative. This is at minimum confusing and potentially chilling.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions.** The form provides no address, fax number, email, or portal link for returning the completed form. A patient who manages to find and fill out this form still has no guidance on how to submit it.
- **No default expiration.** Item 11 asks for an expiration date but provides no default. An authorization left open-ended could remain valid indefinitely, which is not in the patient's best interest.
- **"Person(s) or category of person" in Item 8** is vague — "category of person" is undefined and could lead to overly broad releases.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo in Item 6:** "ANYONE OTHER THAN THEN ATTORNEY" should read "ANYONE OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY."
- **Severely outdated document.** Metadata shows last modification in January 2009 — over 17 years old. The form predates the HITECH Act (2009), the 21st Century Cures Act (2016), and the ONC Information Blocking Rule (2021). It reflects none of these legal developments.
- **Orphaned URL.** The `.doc` file is hosted at a URL not linked from any current website page, suggesting the organization may have forgotten this file exists.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Proper handling of sensitive categories.** The form correctly requires separate initialing for HIV-related information, substance abuse treatment, and mental health records, with appropriate anti-redisclosure language and civil rights agency contact information — reflecting careful attention to NY and NJ state-law requirements at the time of drafting.
- **Anti-conditioning statement.** Item 4 clearly states that treatment and benefits will not be conditioned on signing the authorization — a patient-protective disclosure.
