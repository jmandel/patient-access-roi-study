# ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP
- **Website:** https://www.entandallergy.com
- **Location:** Tarrytown, NY (80+ offices across NY, NJ, PA, TX)
- **Type:** Physician practice, independent, for-profit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release form with filetype:pdf** — Found a reference to a `.doc` file hosted at `entandallergy.com/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`. No PDF version of the ROI form was found directly on the site.
2. **Web search for medical records release form on site** — Confirmed the `.doc` form URL and found no additional PDF forms specifically for medical records release.
3. **Website navigation** — Browsed homepage and FAQ page. The site has no visible "Patient Forms" or "Medical Records" section in the main navigation. The FAQ section has a "Medical records – Questions regarding how they are processed?" entry, but it only discusses record retention policies, not how to request records or download a release form.
4. **Footer links** — Found an "Allergy Authorization Form" PDF in the footer, which turned out to be a form completion fee acknowledgment (not an ROI form).

- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 144,217 bytes

## Difficulties Encountered
- **No dedicated patient forms page:** The website lacks a "Patient Forms" or "Medical Records Request" section, making the ROI form very difficult to find through site navigation alone.
- **Form is a .doc file, not PDF:** The ROI form is hosted as a Microsoft Word document rather than a PDF, which is unusual and less accessible. It had to be converted to PDF for this study.
- **Form is not linked from any visible page:** The `.doc` form URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) does not appear to be linked from any navigable page on the current website. It was only discoverable via web search.
- **Old form:** The Word document metadata shows it was last saved in January 2009, suggesting it may be outdated.
