# Wayne County Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Wayne County Hospital
- **Location:** Monticello, KY 42633
- **Website:** https://waynehospital.org/
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms:** Searched for `"Wayne County Hospital" Monticello KY "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — found a direct PDF link at `waynehospital.org/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf`.
2. **Web search for medical records release:** Searched for `"Wayne County Hospital" Monticello Kentucky medical records release form` — found the hospital has both an online web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` and the downloadable PDF.
3. **Website navigation:** Browsed the hospital website's homepage, Departments page, and Health Information Management page. The HIM page provides contact info (606-340-3227) but does not link directly to the downloadable PDF form. The homepage does not have a direct link to medical records forms either.
4. **Checked for other Wayne County Hospital sites:** Confirmed that `waynecountyhospital.org` is a different hospital in Corydon, Iowa — not related to this organization.

## What Worked
- The direct web search for PDF forms on waynehospital.org was the most effective approach, immediately surfacing the downloadable PDF.
- The hospital also offers an online web-based release form at https://waynehospital.org/Release-of-Health-Form (not a PDF — it's an HTML form on their website).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://waynehospital.org/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf
- **File size:** 71,933 bytes (~70 KB)
- **Pages:** 1
- **Document type:** Request to Review/Receive Medical Information form
- **Description:** A single-page PDF titled "WAYNE COUNTY HOSPITAL — REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." It includes fields for patient identification (name, DOB, address, phone), delivery method (fax, email, mail, pick-up), record type (self, child, other), dates of service, specific information requested (discharge summary, H&P, operative report, lab, radiology, etc.), reason for request, and identification presented. References KRS 422.317 regarding free first copy. Has text layer (not an image-only scan). Appears to be a flat PDF (no fillable fields visible from pdftotext output). Form is designed for patients requesting their own records or those of their children.

## Difficulties
- The HIM department page on the website does not link directly to the downloadable PDF form — the form was found only through web search finding the direct URL in the `/files/galleries/` directory.
- The hospital's website is relatively simple and lacks a dedicated "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section.
- The online web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` is a separate mechanism from the PDF — it captures the same information but as an HTML form submission rather than a downloadable document.

## Additional Notes
- The hospital also offers an online Release of Health Form (web-based, not PDF) at https://waynehospital.org/Release-of-Health-Form. This is a web form that collects patient info, delivery preference, record type, dates, specific information requested, and reason — functionally equivalent to the PDF but submitted electronically.
- Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed critical access facility in rural Kentucky.
