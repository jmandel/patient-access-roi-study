# HopeHealth (Florence, SC) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** HopeHealth, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.hope-health.org/
- **Location:** Florence, SC (360 North Irby St, Florence, SC 29501)
- **Type:** FQHC (Federally Qualified Health Center), independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies Tried

1. **Web searches** for `"HopeHealth" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no HopeHealth-specific PDF form found.
2. **Web searches** for `"HopeHealth" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — results pointed to a JotForm (see below) and generic HIPAA forms, but no HopeHealth-branded PDF.
3. **Site-specific search** (`site:hope-health.org authorization release medical records`) — found the Medical Records page at https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/, which directs patients to HealthMark Group's online portal.
4. **Website navigation** — browsed Patient Resources, Become a Patient, Health Professionals, and Medical Records pages. No downloadable ROI/authorization form PDF found anywhere on the site.
5. **HTML source inspection** — scraped the medical records page and homepage for links containing "release", "authorization", "roi", "form", or "pdf". Found only the Notice of Privacy Practices, Patient Handbook, and HealthMark portal link.
6. **Wayback Machine** — checked archived versions from 2020–2024. The medical records page has consistently directed patients to HealthMark Group throughout this period; no earlier version with a downloadable form was found.
7. **JotForm investigation** — a JotForm at https://form.jotform.com/222895392471061 appeared in search results claiming to be for HopeHealth. However, the JotForm account name is "hopeclinicellisco" (Hope Clinic Ellis County), and the form is NOT linked from anywhere on hope-health.org. This form belongs to Hope Health Ellis County, TX (hopehealthtx.org), a completely different organization.
8. **HealthMark Group portal** — checked https://medrelease.healthmark-group.com/ (login-only for clients/employees) and https://requestmanager.healthmark-group.com/register (requires email verification to proceed). No downloadable form accessible without completing the full request flow.
9. **HealthMark generic form** — found a generic HealthMark Medical Records Release Authorization form at https://www.hmutx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HealthMark-Medical-Record-Release-Auth.pdf. Downloaded as form-2.pdf.

## Key Findings

1. **No HopeHealth-specific ROI/authorization form PDF exists online.** The organization does not publish a downloadable authorization form on their website.
2. **HopeHealth uses HealthMark Group** as their third-party medical records release partner. All medical records requests are directed through HealthMark's online Request Manager portal (https://requestmanager.healthmark-group.com/register).
3. **The request process is entirely online** — patients enter their email, receive a secure link, and complete the request digitally through HealthMark's system.
4. **The JotForm result was a false lead** — it belongs to a different organization (Hope Health Ellis County, TX) and is not associated with HopeHealth Florence, SC.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **No downloadable form:** HopeHealth has fully outsourced their medical records release process to HealthMark Group. There is no standalone PDF form that patients can download, print, and submit.
- **Confusing search results:** Multiple web search results conflated HopeHealth Florence SC (hope-health.org) with Hope Health Ellis County TX (hopehealthtx.org), leading to false positives for the JotForm.
- **HealthMark portal behind authentication:** The HealthMark Request Manager requires email verification to proceed, making it impossible to access the actual authorization workflow or any forms within it.
- **Consistent across all archive snapshots:** The Wayback Machine showed that HopeHealth has been using the HealthMark portal approach since at least 2020, so there doesn't appear to have been a recent transition from downloadable forms.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard

No HopeHealth-branded ROI form PDF is publicly available for download. The organization has fully delegated medical records requests to a third-party portal (HealthMark Group), which requires email verification to initiate.
