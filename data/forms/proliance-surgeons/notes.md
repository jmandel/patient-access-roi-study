# Proliance Surgeons — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search**: `Proliance Surgeons release of information authorization medical records form` — immediately surfaced two PDF URLs (one from npsmri.com, one from proliancesurgeons.com) and the main medical records page.
2. **Site-scoped search**: `site:proliancesurgeons.com medical records release authorization form PDF` — found two additional forms (an incoming records request form and a ProOrtho subsidiary form).

Both searches were highly productive. No need to navigate the website manually or use browser tools.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://npsmri.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Proliance-Release-of-Information.pdf
- **File size**: 24,078 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: Image-only scan (JBIG2 compressed, no text layer) of what appears to be a Proliance Surgeons ROI form. Hosted on npsmri.com (Northwest Physicians Specialists / MRI, a Proliance member practice).
- **Notes**: No extractable text. Appears to be a scanned version of the same or similar form as form-2 and form-4.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://proliancesurgeons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PHWE-Record-Release-Form.pdf
- **File size**: 98,690 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: "Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information" — a standard ROI/authorization form. Has text layer but no fillable fields. Created in Word on Mac. Title references "PHWE" (Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, a Proliance member practice).
- **Notes**: This is the primary ROI form linked from the main Proliance Surgeons medical records page. Covers scope selection, sensitive information categories (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), recipient info, marketing disclosures, expiration, and patient rights including revocation.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://proliancesurgeons.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PACO-PROS-Medical-Records-Release-Authorization-INCOMING-Records.pdf
- **File size**: 63,665 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" for incoming records — used to request records FROM another provider TO Proliance Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons (Bellingham, WA location). Pre-filled with PROS destination address and fax.
- **Notes**: This is an incoming records request form, not a patient-initiated release. Useful for understanding how Proliance handles record transfers but oriented toward getting records sent TO them, not from them to patients.

### form-4.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.proortho.com/wp-content/uploads/authorization-to-disclose.pdf
- **File size**: 99,656 bytes (1 page)
- **Description**: "Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information" — nearly identical to form-2. Hosted on proortho.com (ProOrtho, a Proliance member practice). Has fillable checkbox fields.
- **Notes**: Same template as form-2 but with interactive checkboxes. This version appears to be more digitally accessible.

## Difficulties

- **None significant**. Forms were easy to find via web search. The main Proliance medical records page (https://proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links to the form and also mentions Datavant as their ROI partner for online requests.
- form-1.pdf is an image-only scan with no text layer, limiting its accessibility.
- Proliance is a large multi-practice group, so different member practices (PHWE, PROS/PACO, ProOrtho, NPS/MRI) host their own versions of the form, leading to some fragmentation.

## Summary

Proliance Surgeons makes their ROI form readily available online. The primary form (form-2) is a 1-page authorization covering standard HIPAA disclosure elements. Multiple variants exist across their member practices. The organization also offers online records requests through Datavant. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.
