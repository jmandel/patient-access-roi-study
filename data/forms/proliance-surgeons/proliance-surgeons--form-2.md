# Evaluation: Proliance Surgeons — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information" — a standard HIPAA authorization form for releasing medical records. The title references "PHWE" (Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts) in the filename (`PHWE-Record-Release-Form.pdf`), indicating it originates from a specific Proliance member practice, though the form body names only "Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S." as the covered entity.

Among the four forms retrieved for Proliance Surgeons, form-2 is the primary ROI authorization linked from the main Proliance medical records page. Form-1 is an image-only scan of what appears to be the same or similar template. Form-4 (hosted on proortho.com) is a near-identical version of this same template — same title, same structure, same language — but with interactive checkbox fields. Form-3 is a different document entirely: an incoming records request form for Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons. So form-2 and form-4 are functionally the same authorization, just hosted by different member practices with slightly different digital treatments.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per retrieval notes, this form was **easy to find**. A basic web search for `Proliance Surgeons release of information authorization medical records form` immediately surfaced the URL. The form is also linked from the main Proliance medical records page at `proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/`. The notes indicate that page also mentions Datavant as an online ROI partner.

The source URL (`https://proliancesurgeons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PHWE-Record-Release-Form.pdf`) is reasonably descriptive — the filename includes "Record-Release-Form" — though the "PHWE" prefix is opaque to patients who wouldn't know this abbreviation refers to Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts.

The fragmentation across member practices (NPS/MRI hosting form-1, ProOrtho hosting form-4) could confuse patients who land on a subsidiary site rather than the main Proliance domain, but the primary pathway through proliancesurgeons.com is clear and direct.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (3,260 characters), making the document screen-reader accessible and searchable.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive fields — all blanks are represented as underscores in the text layer. Patients must print and hand-write entries. This is notably worse than form-4, which has interactive checkboxes.
- **File size**: 98,690 bytes for a single page with no embedded images. This is somewhat large for a text-only one-page PDF, consistent with having been created from Microsoft Word on Mac (as noted in the retrieval notes). Not problematic for downloading but suggests no optimization effort.
- **Font count**: 5 fonts used — reasonable for a single-page form.
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is a print-oriented document. The lack of fillable fields means patients must print, fill by hand, and then scan/fax to submit. The form includes a fax number (`425.820.8975`) and phone number (`425-823-4224`) at the bottom, which appear to be hardcoded for a specific practice location rather than the broader Proliance organization — reinforcing its origin as a practice-specific paper form.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and structure**: A single page divided into two clearly labeled sections: "I. My Authorization" and "II. My Rights." This is an efficient, well-proportioned layout. The two-section structure logically separates what the patient is authorizing from what rights they retain.

**Scope options**: The form offers four scope selections:
1. "All health care information in my medical record"
2. Information relating to a specific treatment or condition
3. Information for specific date(s)
4. Other (e.g., X-rays, bills) with date specification

This provides good granularity. A separate section addresses sensitive categories — HIV, psychiatric/mental health, STDs, and drug/alcohol use — requiring explicit opt-in via checkboxes, which aligns with state laws requiring special authorization for these categories.

**Recipient identification**: The form collects name/title, organization, address, city/state/zip, phone, and fax for the recipient — thorough but entirely paper-oriented (no email field).

**Reason for authorization**: Three options — "at my request," marketing-related (with a second checkbox for paid marketing), and "other." The marketing checkboxes include brief but useful context about when they apply.

**Expiration**: The form provides two expiration options (specific date or triggering event) and includes a parenthetical note about 90-day automatic expiration for disclosures to financial institutions or employers for non-payment purposes.

**Language quality**: The text is relatively clear and uses a mix of plain language and legal phrasing. The "My Rights" section is written in first person ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), which is patient-friendly. However, some phrasing is dense, such as: "If disclosure is to a financial institution or employer of the patient for purposes other than payment, then as to those disclosures this authorization expires 90 days after signed, unless renewed."

**Layout**: Clean and readable for a single page. The visual hierarchy is established through section numbering and formatting. However, without seeing the rendered PDF (only extracted text), detailed layout assessment is limited. The extracted text structure suggests a straightforward linear layout.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This form is a general authorization to "Use or Disclose" health information — it does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records (a HIPAA Right of Access request under § 164.524) and a third-party release. The "at my request" reason checkbox is the closest it comes to acknowledging patient-initiated access, but the form structure assumes a disclosure *to someone else*, requiring a full recipient name, address, and fax. A patient wanting records sent to themselves must fill in their own contact information as the "recipient," which is awkward.

**No mention of HIPAA Right of Access**: The form does not reference 45 CFR § 164.524 or the patient's specific right to access their own records. The "My Rights" section mentions the right to revoke, the non-conditioning of treatment, and re-disclosure risk — all standard HIPAA authorization elements — but these relate to *authorizations* (§ 164.508), not *access requests*.

**No electronic delivery option**: No email field, no mention of electronic copies, no patient portal reference. The form only collects physical address and fax number for the recipient. For a form last updated in 2021, this is a notable omission.

**No mention of EHI export or bulk data access**: Nothing about electronic health information export or USCDI data.

**No fee disclosure**: The form does not mention any fees for records access. This is neutral — not disclosing fees avoids creating a deterrent, but it also leaves patients uninformed about potential costs.

**Revocation instructions are clear**: The form explains two methods for revoking authorization (revocation form or letter to the practice), which is helpful.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No notarization or witness requirement**: The form requires only the patient's signature (or legally authorized individual), date, and time. No notary, witness, or in-person submission mandate.

**Sensitive information categories**: The form properly separates HIV, mental health, STDs, and substance use into explicit opt-in checkboxes, consistent with Washington state law (RCW 70.02) requirements for special authorization for these categories.

**Expiration**: The form requires patients to specify an expiration date or triggering event, with a special 90-day rule for financial institution/employer disclosures. There is no default expiration if the patient leaves this blank, which could result in an open-ended authorization — though this is common practice.

**Marketing disclosures**: The form includes HIPAA-required marketing disclosure checkboxes, including whether the practice receives remuneration for marketing-related disclosures.

**Authorization vs. Right of Access conflation**: The form is structured as an authorization under § 164.508, not a Right of Access request under § 164.524. While providers often use authorization forms for patient access requests, this conflation means patients requesting their own records are subject to authorization-specific requirements (e.g., specifying a recipient, stating a reason) that HIPAA does not require for access requests. A provider could technically deny a request that fails to fully complete this form, even though HIPAA access rights are less burdensome.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Authorization/Access conflation**: The form is structured entirely as a § 164.508 authorization. Patients requesting their own records under the Right of Access (§ 164.524) should not need to complete the same form as a third-party release. This may impose unnecessary burden — requiring patients to specify a recipient, reason, and expiration when they simply want a copy of their records.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Practice-specific contact info baked in**: The fax (`425.820.8975`) and phone (`425-823-4224`) at the bottom appear to be for a specific practice (likely PHWE in Kirkland), yet the form is presented as the primary Proliance-wide ROI form. A patient at a different Proliance practice may not know where to send the completed form.
- **No default expiration**: If a patient leaves the expiration field blank, it's unclear whether the authorization has a default expiration or remains open-ended. Unlike form-3 (which defaults to 6 months), this form is silent on the matter.
- **"I may not be able to revoke this authorization if its purpose was to obtain insurance"**: This statement is vague and potentially alarming without further context about what "obtain insurance" means in this context.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Inconsistent contact details vs. org scope**: The filename (`PHWE-Record-Release-Form.pdf`) references Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, but this practice-specific identifier conflicts with the form's presentation as the primary Proliance Surgeons authorization form. The embedded phone/fax numbers are practice-specific, creating a mismatch between the form's stated entity (Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S.) and its operational context.
- **Typo in "My Rights" section**: "If I did, it would not affect any actions already taken" — the phrasing "If I did" is grammatically awkward following "I may revoke this authorization in writing." Should likely read "If I do" or "If I revoke this authorization."

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Clean two-section structure**: The "I. My Authorization" / "II. My Rights" division is clear and logically organized, making the form easy to navigate.
- **Sensitive information categories**: Properly separates HIV, mental health, STDs, and substance use into explicit opt-in checkboxes rather than bundling them with general records release, respecting Washington state privacy protections.
- **First-person rights language**: The "My Rights" section is written from the patient's perspective ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), which is more accessible than typical third-person legal boilerplate.
