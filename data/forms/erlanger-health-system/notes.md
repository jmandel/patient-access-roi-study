# Erlanger Health System — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Erlanger Health System
- **Website:** https://www.erlanger.org
- **Location:** Chattanooga, TN
- **Type:** Teaching hospital, regional system, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs:** Searched for `"Erlanger Health System" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not surface direct links.
2. **Web search for medical records release form:** Searched for `"Erlanger Health System" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found all three forms with direct download URLs.
3. **Site-scoped search:** Searched `site:erlanger.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the Medical Records page at `https://www.erlanger.org/patient-and-family-resources/patient-tools/medical-records` and the behavioral health form.

Strategy #2 was the most productive, surfacing all three forms in a single search.

- **File size:** 254,097 bytes
- **PDF version:** 1.6
- **Has text layer:** Yes
- **Description:** "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" form — specifically designed for patients requesting their own records (as opposed to third-party release). Includes options for record types (hospital summary, discharge summary, ER records, lab reports, radiology, etc.), delivery format (CD, email, paper copy), and date range selection. Originally from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital but applicable system-wide.

## Difficulties
- No significant difficulties. All forms were publicly available and downloadable without bot blocking or login walls.
- Form-2 (behavioral health) is hosted on a separate domain (erlangerbh.com) rather than the main erlanger.org site.
- Form-2 is an image-only scan with no text layer, making it inaccessible for text extraction.

## Summary
Erlanger Health System provides three distinct ROI-related forms: a general authorization for release (form-1), a behavioral health-specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a patient-specific access request form (form-3). The patient access form (form-3) is notably more patient-centered, offering specific record type checkboxes and delivery format options including email and CD. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.
