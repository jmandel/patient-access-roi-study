# Aurora Medical Center - Grafton: ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Aurora Medical Center - Grafton
- **Location**: Grafton, WI
- **Parent System**: Advocate Health (formerly Advocate Aurora Health / Aurora Health Care)
- **Website**: https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/locations/hospital/aurora-medical-center-grafton

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `Aurora Medical Center Grafton "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no facility-specific form found; Aurora uses system-wide forms.
2. **Web search** for `Aurora Health Care "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` — found the main authorization form PDF URL and the medical records page.
3. **Navigated** to the Aurora Health Care medical records page at https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records — this page clearly lists all available forms with download links.

The medical records page was easy to find (Home > Patients & Visitors > Medical Records) and well-organized. Aurora uses system-level forms for all facilities including Aurora Medical Center - Grafton.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/-/media/Project/Health-System-Enterprise/AuroraHealthCareOrg/aurorahealthcare/documents/patients-visitors/medical-records/authorization-for-release-of-information-wi-il.PDF`
- **Document type**: Authorization to Release Protected Health Information (general ROI form)
- **Description**: 1-page fillable PDF for authorizing release of health information to third parties. Includes checkboxes for record types (medical records, imaging, billing), purpose of release, and delivery method options (mail, encrypted email, CD, patient portal). This version was found via web search and appears to be an older or alternate URL.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/-/media/Project/Health-System-Enterprise/AuroraHealthCareOrg/aurorahealthcare/documents/patients-visitors/medical-records/authorization-to-release-protected-health-information-wi-il-s300503.PDF`
- **Document type**: Authorization to Release Protected Health Information (general ROI form)
- **Description**: Same title and content layout as form-1.pdf, but a different file (different MD5 hash, same file size). This is the version directly linked from the medical records page. May represent a different revision of the same form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: `https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/-/media/Project/Health-System-Enterprise/AuroraHealthCareOrg/aurorahealthcare/documents/patients-visitors/medical-records/patient-request-for-health-information-s88411en.PDF`
- **Document type**: Patient Request for Health Information (patient-specific access form)
- **Description**: 1-page form specifically for patients requesting their own health information. Mentions the patient portal (LiveWell) as an alternative. Includes checkboxes for record types and imaging. This is the patient-access-specific form (distinct from the general third-party authorization form).

## Additional Forms Available (not downloaded - not primary ROI forms)
The medical records page also links to:
- Authorization form in Spanish
- Patient Request form in Spanish
- Instructions for completing each form
- Patient Request for PHI Release Restriction
- Patient Request for Accounting of Disclosure
- Revocation of Authorization to Release PHI
- Third Party Electronic Data Request

## Difficulties
- **None significant**. Aurora Health Care has an excellent, well-organized medical records page with clear form links.
- The organization uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones for Aurora Medical Center - Grafton.
- Two different URLs exist for the authorization form (form-1 and form-2) which appear to be slightly different versions of the same document.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
Forms were found within 2 clicks from the main website and also appeared in web search results. Multiple submission methods are offered (email, fax, mail, in-person).
