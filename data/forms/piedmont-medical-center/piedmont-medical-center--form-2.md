# Piedmont Medical Center — Form 2 Evaluation

**Document:** form-2.pdf (380,157 bytes, 2 pages)
**Source URL:** https://www.piedmontphysiciannetwork.com/docs/pmcphysiciannetworklibraries/default-document-library/auth-disclose-medical-record.pdf
**Organization:** Piedmont Medical Center (Rock Hill, SC) — community hospital, for-profit (Tenet Healthcare), South region

---

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a generic **"Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information"** form from the Piedmont Physician Network (PMC's affiliated physician practice group), hosted on a separate website (piedmontphysiciannetwork.com). It is the more detailed of two forms found for this organization:

- **Form 1** (1 page): The hospital-specific authorization form, hosted on the main piedmontmedicalcenter.com site, branded with "Piedmont Medical Center" and a form number (EZ-7003). Simpler, more compact.
- **Form 2** (2 pages, this document): The physician network version, more comprehensive in its legal language, with dedicated sections for highly confidential information, purpose, term, and detailed rights disclosures.

The two forms serve overlapping but distinct parts of the organization — form 1 for the hospital itself, form 2 for the physician practices. Neither is specifically designed for patient self-access requests; both are general third-party release authorization forms.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, the form was found via web search and is hosted on the Piedmont Physician Network website. It was not linked from the main Piedmont Medical Center "Request Medical Records" page (which links to form 1 and to the Datavant/Swellbox online portal). A patient visiting the hospital's medical records page would find form 1 and the online portal, but would not be directed to this physician network form.

The source URL path (`/docs/pmcphysiciannetworklibraries/default-document-library/auth-disclose-medical-record.pdf`) is reasonably descriptive, though the "default-document-library" segment suggests a content management system default rather than intentional information architecture. The form itself contains no header branding or organization name in the extracted text — a patient who downloads it out of context cannot tell which organization it belongs to.

**Overall findability for a patient**: This form would require a patient to know that the physician network has its own form separate from the hospital. It is discoverable via web search but not prominently linked from the main hospital website's patient resources.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (4,687 characters), not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive fields — it is a flat PDF designed for print-and-fill.
- **File size**: 380 KB for 2 pages. Moderately large for a text-dominant document (2.3× larger than form 1's single page at 167 KB), likely due to the 1 embedded image.
- **Font count**: 4 fonts.
- **Embedded images**: 1 (likely a logo or header graphic, though the form text has no organization branding in the extracted text).
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is clearly designed as a paper form. Fields are indicated by blank lines and underscores (e.g., `____________________________________________________________________`), and checkboxes are represented by whitespace placeholders rather than interactive elements. The date field pre-prints `, 200` — a fixed two-century prefix that could not function in a digital-first design.

The form functions as a print-only artifact. A patient would need to print it, hand-fill it, and return it physically or via fax. There is no indication of electronic submission options.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages. The first page covers patient identification, record types, highly confidential information categories, recipient designation, term, and purpose. The second page contains rights disclosures and signature blocks. The length is proportionate to the content.

**Structure**: The form follows a logical flow — patient info → what to release → special categories → to whom → for how long → for what purpose → rights → signature. Sections are labeled with bold headings like "SPECIFY INFORMATION TO BE DISCLOSED," "MY HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION," "TERM," and "PURPOSE."

**Clarity**: The language is dense legal prose throughout. The highly confidential information section is notably wordy: *"By checking any of the boxes next to a category of highly confidential information listed below, I specifically authorize the use and/or disclosure of the category of highly confidential information indicated next to the box, if any such information will be used or disclosed pursuant to this Authorization."* The rights disclosures on page 2 are written in solid paragraph blocks without bullet points or simplified summaries.

**Record type granularity**: Good — offers 12 specific record type checkboxes (Discharge Summary, Progress/Physician Notes, X-Ray Report, Pathology Report, History & Physical, Nurses Notes, EKG/EMG/EEG Report, Emergency Report, Laboratory Report, Operative Report, Consult Report, Entire Record) plus an "Other" write-in field. Date range filtering is available ("Records for the period (dates) from ___ to ___").

**Layout concerns**: Based on extracted text structure, the form appears to use adequate spacing for sections, though the rights language on page 2 is dense continuous text with no visual breaks between paragraphs.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a generic authorization form for disclosure to any party. It frames the patient as authorizing a "use or disclosure" to a named recipient. There is no pathway, checkbox, or language specifically for a patient requesting their own records. The form asks the patient to specify "Name of Person or Class of Persons who may disclose my health information" and a separate "To release records to" field — a structure that assumes a third-party release scenario.

**Scope options**: Good granularity on record types (12 checkboxes + Other) and date range filtering. The highly confidential information section provides separate opt-in checkboxes for 7 categories of sensitive information (mental health, psychotherapy notes, HIV/AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, sexual assault, child abuse/neglect), which is a thoughtful design element for patient control.

**Format/delivery options**: None mentioned. No checkboxes for delivery method (mail, fax, electronic, pick-up). No mention of electronic delivery or EHI export. The form collects a "telephone number and fax number" for the recipient, implying fax or mail delivery.

**HIPAA Right of Access**: The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524, the Privacy Rule, or patient rights to access their own records. The rights language focuses on re-disclosure, remuneration, revocation, and treatment conditioning — standard authorization disclosures, but not patient access rights.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or TEFCA.

**Social Security Number**: The form requests SSN (`Social Security Number:__________________`). While sometimes used for patient matching, this is a privacy concern and an unnecessary barrier for many patients who may be reluctant to provide it.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Unreasonable barriers**: No notarization requirement. No stated fee. No in-person-only submission requirement (though no electronic submission is offered either). The SSN request is a friction point but not a stated requirement.

**Expiration/auto-revocation**: The TERM section provides multiple options: a specific date, completion of request, a triggering event, or "Other." However, the specific date option reads `, 200` — pre-printed with a year prefix that only accommodates years 2000-2009. This is a clear indicator the form has not been updated since at least 2009. The form does not impose an unreasonably short expiration.

**Revocation rights**: Clearly stated — "I understand that I may refuse to sign or may revoke (at any time) this Authorization for any reason and that such refusal or revocation will not affect the commencement, continuation or quality of my treatment." Written revocation to the "health facility's Privacy Office at the practice address" is specified, though no specific address, email, or phone is provided (unlike form 1, which gives a physical address and email).

**Treatment conditioning**: Appropriately disclaims conditioning treatment on signing, with a standard exception for research-related treatment.

**Remuneration disclosure**: Includes the statement: "I understand that the health facility may, directly or indirectly, receive remuneration from a third party in connection with the use or disclosure of my health information." This is a required HIPAA disclosure.

**Re-disclosure warning**: Present and appropriately worded.

**Consent bundling**: The highly confidential information section requires separate opt-in for each sensitive category, which is good practice and avoids overbroad bundling.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Social Security Number requested**: The form includes a field for SSN (`Social Security Number:__________________`). Collecting SSNs on authorization forms creates unnecessary privacy risk and may deter patients from completing the form. Date of birth and name are generally sufficient for patient identification in this context.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No organization name anywhere in the form text**: The extracted text contains no branding, header, or reference to "Piedmont Medical Center" or "Piedmont Physician Network." Blank fields reference "the health facility" and "the practice" generically. A patient who receives this form out of context (e.g., emailed, shared as a link) has no way to identify which organization it belongs to. This is in contrast to form 1, which is clearly branded "Piedmont Medical Center."
- **"Privacy Office at the practice address"**: The revocation instructions direct patients to "the health facility's Privacy Office at the practice address" without providing an actual address, email, or phone number. A patient would need to independently determine the correct contact information.
- **Ambiguous scope of "health facility"**: The form uses "health facility" and "practice" interchangeably without defining either. It's unclear whether this covers a single physician office, the entire Piedmont Physician Network, or the broader Piedmont Medical Center system.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Year field locked to "200_"**: The TERM section's date field reads `, 200` — a pre-printed year prefix that cannot accommodate any date after 2009. This is a factual error that renders one of the four term options unusable in its current state. It strongly suggests the form has not been updated in at least 16 years.
- **No form revision date**: Unlike form 1 (which shows "R03/2013"), this form has no revision date, version number, or form identifier, making it impossible to track currency.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular highly confidential information opt-in**: The form provides 7 separate checkboxes for categories of sensitive information (mental health, psychotherapy notes, HIV/AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, sexual assault, child abuse/neglect), each requiring explicit patient opt-in. This is stronger than many authorization forms that either bundle all sensitive records together or omit special handling entirely.
- **Multiple term options**: Rather than imposing a fixed expiration, the form offers four flexible options for authorization duration — a specific date, request fulfillment, a triggering event, or custom — giving patients meaningful control over authorization scope.
