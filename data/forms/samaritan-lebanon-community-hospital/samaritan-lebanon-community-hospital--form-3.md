## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3.pdf is a **HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)** for Samaritan Health Services — it is *not* a Release of Information (ROI) or authorization form. The document opens with: "Your information. Your rights. Our responsibilities. THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION."

This NPP applies system-wide to all Samaritan Health Services entities and explicitly lists Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital among the covered facilities ("Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center," "Samaritan Albany General Hospital," "Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital," "Samaritan North Lincoln Hospital," "Samaritan Pacific Communities Hospital," plus affiliated clinics).

In the context of the five forms downloaded for this organization, form-3 is the only NPP. The actual ROI forms are:
- **form-4.pdf** (primary Authorization to Disclose Health Information, English)
- **form-5.pdf** (same, Spanish)
- **form-1.pdf** (specialized Computer Readable EHI Export Request, English)
- **form-2.pdf** (same, Spanish)

As an NPP, this document is a supporting/informational document rather than an actionable authorization form. It informs patients of their rights but does not itself serve as a mechanism for requesting records.

## 2. FINDABILITY

According to the retrieval notes, form-3.pdf was found on the samhealth.org "Forms and Documents" page. It was not the most prominently featured document — the website primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal for records requests. The NPP was relatively straightforward to locate compared to the authorization forms, which were hidden inside collapsed accordion sections. The URL (`/shs-notice-of-privacy-practices?type=pdf`) is clean and descriptive.

However, a patient looking specifically for information about their rights to access medical records would likely land on the "Request Medical Records" page first, where this NPP is not prominently linked. The NPP is a separate document on a different page, meaning patients might not encounter it in the context where it would be most useful (i.e., when they are trying to understand their right to request records before filling out the authorization form).

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present and high quality. The full 9,982-character text extracts cleanly with proper paragraph structure, bullet points, and headings preserved. No OCR artifacts or garbled text.

**Fillable fields**: Zero — but this is appropriate for an NPP, which is an informational document that patients read rather than fill out.

**File size**: 619 KB for a 2-page text-only document with 0 embedded images is somewhat large, suggesting the PDF may contain embedded fonts or other overhead. By comparison, the text content itself is under 10 KB.

**Digital-first design**: The document appears to be natively generated (not scanned), with 9 fonts and clean text rendering. The use of checkbox-style bullets (•) and clear section headers suggests deliberate digital typesetting. However, a minor encoding issue exists: some bullet points render as `\u0001` (control character) in the extracted text, specifically under the "Our uses and disclosures" section where sub-bullets appear (e.g., the explanatory text under "Treat you," "Run our organization," and "Bill for your services"). This suggests a font-mapping issue in the PDF that may affect screen readers or text extraction tools.

**PDF version**: Not explicitly stated in metadata but the document is well-structured.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: Two pages for an NPP is impressively concise. Many NPPs run 6-10+ pages. This document manages to cover all required HIPAA NPP content areas in a compact format.

**Clarity**: The language is notably plain and accessible. Sections are introduced with clear, patient-friendly headings phrased as questions or statements:
- "Who does this Notice apply to?"
- "Your rights"
- "Your choices"
- "Our uses and disclosures"
- "Our responsibilities"

The opening tagline — "Your information. Your rights. Our responsibilities." — is an effective plain-language summary of the document's purpose.

**Organization**: The document follows a logical flow: covered entities → patient rights → patient choices → organizational uses → organizational responsibilities → contact information. Each section uses bullet points to break down complex concepts.

**Examples**: The document provides practical examples to clarify abstract concepts, e.g., "Example: A doctor treating you for an injury asks another doctor about your overall health condition." These make the legal requirements more tangible.

**Readability**: Text appears to be in a readable font size. The use of bold section headers, bullet points, and short paragraphs creates good visual hierarchy. The document avoids dense legalese in favor of conversational phrasing like "Ask us how to do this" and "We will say 'yes' to all reasonable requests."

**Contact information**: Clearly presented at the end with phone number (541-768-5069), email (privacy@samhealth.org), and an additional direct line for the Privacy Officer (541-768-2165), along with business hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday).

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Right of Access language**: The document explicitly addresses the patient's right to obtain their records: "You can ask to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and other health information we have about you." It further states: "We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information, usually within 30 days of your request. We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee."

**Electronic delivery mention**: The document mentions patients can "get an electronic or paper copy" of their records, which is notable — many NPPs omit electronic access options.

**Format options**: Not discussed in detail (this is appropriate — format options belong on the authorization form, not the NPP).

**Proxy/representative access**: Clearly addressed: "If you have given someone medical power of attorney or if someone is your legal guardian, that person can exercise your rights and make choices about your health information."

**Complaint rights**: Well-documented, including both internal complaint options and the external HHS Office for Civil Rights complaint process with specific contact information (address, phone, URL). Includes the important assurance: "We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint."

**Limitation**: The NPP does not cross-reference or link to the actual authorization forms. A patient reading this document and learning about their right to access records would need to navigate separately to find the ROI form. A simple sentence like "To request your records, visit samhealth.org/medical-records or ask for an Authorization to Disclose Health Information form" would bridge this gap.

**No mention of EHI exports**: The NPP does not mention computer-readable exports or electronic health information in bulk format, despite the organization offering a separate EHI Export Request form (form-1.pdf). This is a missed opportunity to inform patients about this option.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Effective date**: "This notice is effective as of January 2020." This is now over 6 years old. While HIPAA does not mandate specific NPP update intervals (only when material changes occur), the age raises a question about whether recent regulatory changes (e.g., information blocking rules under the 21st Century Cures Act) have been incorporated.

**Fee language**: States "We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee" for copies, which aligns with HIPAA's fee provisions (45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4)).

**Timeline**: Commits to providing records "usually within 30 days," which aligns with HIPAA's 30-day timeline requirement.

**Special protections**: The document addresses special protections for HIV-related information, alcohol/drug treatment records, mental health records, and genetic test results, noting that additional state and federal protections apply. This is appropriately thorough.

**Health Information Exchange**: Includes a section about sharing information across Health Information Exchanges, which is transparent but also notable — it states "We can make your health information available across Health Information Exchanges" without clearly explaining patient opt-out rights for HIE participation.

**Self-pay restriction right**: Properly addresses the HITECH-era right: "If you pay for a service or health care item out-of-pocket in full, you can ask us not to share that information for the purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer. We will say 'yes' unless a law requires us to share that information."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Exceptionally concise NPP**: At 2 pages, this is one of the most compact NPPs possible while still covering all HIPAA-required content areas. Most NPPs are 4-10+ pages and far less readable.
- **Plain-language design**: The opening tagline "Your information. Your rights. Our responsibilities." and the use of question-based headings ("Who does this Notice apply to?") make this feel like a document written for patients rather than for lawyers. Practical examples under the "Our uses and disclosures" section further enhance accessibility.
- **Non-retaliation assurance**: Explicitly stating "We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint" is a best practice that many NPPs omit.
- **Dual contact paths**: Providing both the HIM department phone number and a separate Privacy Officer email and phone creates multiple avenues for patients to get help.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Ask us how to do this"**: The rights section tells patients they can request copies of records or corrections but simply says "Ask us how to do this" rather than providing a direct reference to the authorization form or a URL. A patient reading this document alone would not know what practical steps to take next.
- **HIE opt-out unclear**: The Health Information Exchange section states the organization "can" share data across HIEs but does not explain whether patients can opt out of HIE participation or how to do so.
- **Summary vs. copy**: The document says "We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information" — HIPAA requires a copy unless the patient agrees to a summary. The phrasing here could give the impression that the organization may unilaterally choose to provide a summary instead of the full record.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Control character rendering**: Some bullet-point markers in the "Our uses and disclosures" section extract as `\u0001` (Unicode control character) rather than proper bullet symbols, indicating a font-encoding issue in the PDF. This could cause problems for screen readers and assistive technologies.
