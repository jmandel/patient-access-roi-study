# Evaluation: Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital — form-4.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-4.pdf is the **primary Authorization to Disclose Health Information** form (English version) used across all Samaritan Health Services facilities, including Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital. It is a system-level form — not facility-specific — branded "Samaritan Health Services" with form number `000693 (04/23) 7`. Page 1 is the authorization itself; page 2 provides instructions and rights information.

This form sits within a suite of five downloaded documents:
- **form-1.pdf**: Specialized EHI Computer Readable Export request form (English)
- **form-2.pdf**: EHI Computer Readable Export request form (Spanish)
- **form-3.pdf**: Notice of Privacy Practices
- **form-4.pdf** *(this document)*: Standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information (English)
- **form-5.pdf**: Standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information (Spanish)

Form-4 is the general-purpose ROI form that patients would use for most medical records requests. It is the counterpart to form-1, which handles only computer-readable EHI exports.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was **difficult to locate**. Per the retrieval notes, the standard ROI form is not prominently linked on the Request Medical Records page. The page primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal. The downloadable PDF form links are "hidden inside a collapsed/accordion section titled 'Sending a Request by Mail or Fax'" and required browser-based JavaScript inspection to discover. Multiple web searches were needed, and initial results returned forms from similarly-named but unrelated organizations ("Samaritan Medical Center" in Watertown, NY and "samaritanhealth.com").

The source URL (`https://samhealth.org/authorization-to-disclose-health-information?type=pdf`) is reasonably descriptive, but the path to reach it through normal site navigation is obscure. The organization's primary mechanism is an outsourced MRO portal, making the downloadable form a secondary, poorly-surfaced option.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present and high-quality. The full extracted text (8,531 characters) is clean, well-structured, and free of OCR artifacts. This is a digitally-authored document, not a scan.

**Fillable fields**: Zero. Despite being a digital-origin PDF with 9 fonts and clean layout, the form has no interactive form fields. Patients must print it and fill it out by hand. The header even says "PLEASE PRINT" — a clear indicator of print-first design.

**File size**: 647,777 bytes (~633 KB) for a 2-page text-dominant document with only 2 embedded images. This is moderately large, suggesting embedded logos or graphical elements, but not unreasonably so.

**Format**: The form is a flat PDF, not a fillable digital document. It is digitally composed (not scanned), with clean Unicode characters (☐ checkboxes render properly in the text layer). However, the lack of fillable fields means patients cannot complete it electronically without third-party PDF annotation tools.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — page 1 is the authorization form with 9 numbered sections; page 2 is instructions and rights information. The length is appropriate and not excessive.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow: patient info → source facility → purpose → record types → sensitive information consent → format → recipient → rights → signature. Each section is numbered 1-9 with clear headings. Page 2 mirrors these numbers with corresponding instructions.

**Clarity**: The language is a mix of functional plain language and legal boilerplate. Section headings are clear ("WHAT RECORDS DO YOU WANT?", "FORMAT OF RECORDS"). The rights section on page 1 contains denser legal language: "I understand that the information disclosed by this authorization may be subject to redisclosure by the recipient and no longer be protected under federal law." Page 2 instructions are written in more accessible language.

**Layout**: Sections are visually distinct with numbered headers. The checkbox-heavy sections (2, 4, 6, 7) offer structured choices. Section 5 (sensitive information) uses an initialing format. The form is reasonably well-organized but dense — section 7 combines "release to myself" and "release to third party" into one section, which could cause confusion.

**Record type granularity**: Section 4 offers 11 specific record type checkboxes (discharge summaries, ED records, clinic notes, H&P reports, lab/pathology, immunizations, operative reports, imaging reports, images, billing records, plus "Other"), along with date range fields. This is good granularity.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form serves both purposes but does distinguish between them. Section 3 includes a "Personal" checkbox for purpose, and section 7 is split into "released to myself" (with multiple delivery options) vs. "OR release my records to" a third party. This dual-purpose design is functional but could be clearer.

**Delivery format options**: Notably strong. Section 6 offers: SHS MyChart Account, Email, Paper, CD, Fax, or "Other." Section 7's "release to myself" options include MyChart, personal email, phone call to arrange pickup, mail, or "Other." The form explicitly offers electronic delivery (email and MyChart), which is uncommon.

**Fee transparency**: Page 2 provides a clear fee schedule:
- "Continuing Care: No Charge"
- "Initial Patient Request: No Charge"
- "Third-Party Request: Reasonable cost-based fees apply in accordance with HIPAA and Oregon law"

This is patient-friendly — patients requesting their own records are explicitly told there is no charge, while only third-party requests incur fees.

**Right of Access language**: The form references HIPAA implicitly through the fee structure ("in accordance with HIPAA and Oregon law") and the rights section discusses refusal to sign, revocation, and redisclosure risks. It does not explicitly cite 45 CFR § 164.524.

**EHI Export awareness**: This form does not mention EHI export or computer-readable formats — that is handled by the separate form-1.pdf. The existence of a dedicated EHI export form is notable, though it means patients must know which form to use.

**Facility selection**: Section 2 lists all five Samaritan hospitals as checkboxes plus options for Samaritan clinics/providers and non-Samaritan providers. This system-wide approach is efficient but requires the patient to know which facility holds their records.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration**: "This authorization expires 12 months from the date I signed this form unless another date or event is specified." This is a standard expiration period — not unreasonably short.

**Revocation**: Clearly stated — authorization "may be canceled (revoked) at any time" with written notice. Page 2 elaborates on the process.

**No notarization requirement**: The form requires only a signature (or representative signature with documentation).

**Processing time**: "Please allow up to 30 days to process requests" — this is within the HIPAA-permitted 30-day window.

**Sensitive information handling**: Section 5 requires separate initials for drug/alcohol records (citing 42 CFR Part 2), mental health records, HIV test results, and genetic testing. This is legally appropriate.

**Submission methods**: The form can be submitted by mail, fax, or in person at five HIM locations. Email is also listed as a contact method (SHSHIMROI@samhealth.org). No in-person-only restriction.

**Minor consent**: Page 2 addresses Oregon-specific minor consent rules, noting that "minors may be able to request certain levels of confidentiality or consent to various health care matters depending on their age."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Free for patient access**: The fee schedule explicitly states "Initial Patient Request: No Charge" and "Continuing Care: No Charge," with fees only for third-party requests. This is clear, patient-friendly, and HIPAA-compliant.
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: Offering MyChart, email, CD, fax, paper, and an open-ended "Other" option gives patients genuine choice in how they receive records — including two electronic options (MyChart and email).
- **Spanish-language version available**: Form-5.pdf is a complete Spanish translation, and the companion EHI export form (form-2.pdf) also has a Spanish version. This is genuine multilingual support.
- **Dedicated EHI export form**: The existence of a separate computer-readable EHI export request form (form-1.pdf) shows awareness of patients' right to electronic health information in machine-readable format — a rare offering.
- **Email security warning**: The form transparently notes: "if you choose to receive your information via email, there may be certain security risks to your information while in transit" — informing patients without blocking the option.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Section 7 dual-purpose structure**: The "released to myself" options and "OR release my records to" third-party options are combined in one section. A patient skimming the form might fill out both subsections or be confused about which applies to them.
- **MyChart 90-day availability window**: Page 2 states records sent to MyChart "are available there for 90 days" — but it's unclear what happens after 90 days. Are they permanently deleted? Can they be re-requested?

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Inconsistent facility naming**: Section 2 lists "Samaritan Lebanon Hospital" while the organization's official name is "Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital." The notes.md confirms the form uses the shorter name.
