1. **Web search**: Searched for "Massachusetts General Hospital authorization release health information form PDF" and "Massachusetts General Hospital medical records release form PDF download". Both immediately returned direct links to the PDF forms.
2. **Parent system check**: MGH is part of Mass General Brigham (formerly Partners HealthCare). The current form is hosted on the Mass General Brigham website (massgeneralbrigham.org) with MGH-specific branding and contact info. A search on the parent system site confirmed the same forms.

## Difficulties Encountered
