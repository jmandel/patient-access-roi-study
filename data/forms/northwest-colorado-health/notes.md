## Observations

- Northwest Colorado Health uses **two separate ROI forms** — one for behavioral health and one for medical/dental records. Patients needing both would need to complete two forms.
- Both forms note that if a patient saw a provider in the other category for substance abuse, a second release form is required.
- Forms are **not fillable** (no interactive PDF fields) — designed to be printed and filled by hand.
- Both forms reference "Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association" as the legacy name in the revocation section, suggesting the organization was previously known by that name.
- Processing time is stated as up to 48 business hours.
- Authorization expires two years from last date of service.
- Forms were easy to find via web search and are publicly accessible on the patient forms page.

## Difficulties
- No significant difficulties. Forms were publicly available and downloaded without any bot blocking or authentication requirements.
