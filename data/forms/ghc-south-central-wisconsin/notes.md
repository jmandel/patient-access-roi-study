# ROI Form Retrieval Notes: Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately found the direct PDF URL on ghcscw.com.
2. **Web search** for "ghcscw.com medical records release form" — confirmed the same form and identified additional resources.
3. **Navigated the forms page** at https://ghcscw.com/members/forms/ — found a comprehensive list of ROI-related forms and identified a second relevant form ("Patient Request for Health Information Form").

## What Worked

The first web search was highly effective, returning the direct PDF link. The organization's forms page is well-organized with a dedicated "Release of Information Forms" section, making discovery straightforward.

## Difficulties Encountered

None. Forms were publicly accessible, clearly labeled, and downloaded without any bot blocking or login requirements.
