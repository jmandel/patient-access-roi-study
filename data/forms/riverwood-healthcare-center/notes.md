# Riverwood Healthcare Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Riverwood Healthcare Center
- **Location:** Aitkin, MN 56431
- **Website:** https://riverwoodhealthcare.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit, Midwest

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms** — Searched for `"Riverwood Healthcare Center" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`. This immediately surfaced two PDF URLs hosted on the organization's WordPress site.
2. **Site-scoped search** — Searched `site:riverwoodhealthcare.org authorization release medical records`. Found the same PDFs plus references to JotForm online versions and the patient forms page.
3. **Patient Forms page** — Navigated to https://riverwoodhealthcare.org/patient-forms/ which is the canonical listing. Found a third, newer PDF link plus two JotForm online equivalents.

## What Worked
The web search strategy was very effective — the first PDF search returned a direct link. The organization hosts forms on their WordPress site and makes them straightforward to find from the Patient Forms page (1 click from main navigation).
