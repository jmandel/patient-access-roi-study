# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Carle BroMenn Medical Center authorization release health information filetype:pdf"** — Found a behavioral health authorization form hosted on carle.org.
2. **Web search for "Carle BroMenn Medical Center medical records release form filetype:pdf"** — Found several PDF forms including a CBMC-specific general ROI form, a system-level Carle Health ROI form, and behavioral health variants.
3. **Web search for "site:carle.org authorization release medical records"** — Confirmed the Carle medical records page at carle.org/patients-visitors/patient-resources/medical-records, plus the Carle Health patient release form and behavioral health form.

The most productive strategy was the second search, which surfaced multiple form URLs directly. Carle BroMenn Medical Center is part of Carle Health, and both facility-specific and system-level forms are available on carle.org.
