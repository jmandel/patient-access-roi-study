## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **GI (Gastroenterology) department-specific** authorization for release of information. The form is pre-filled with the WWMG GI Department's address ("4225 Hoyt Ave, Ste A, Everett, WA 98203") and phone/fax numbers in the "disclose this health care information to" section, meaning the recipient of records is hard-coded to the GI department.

In the context of WWMG's three discovered forms, this is a **secondary, specialty-specific form**. Form-1 is the primary organization-wide fillable ROI form (1 page, 39 fillable fields, updated August 2024). Form-3 is a generic, unbranded form hosted on PatientPop. This form-2 occupies a middle ground: it has more detailed HIPAA rights language than form-1 but is narrower in scope (limited to GI department use) and technically less functional (no fillable fields, dated January 2023).

The form's filename (`Authorization-for-Release-of-Information-Medical-Records-WWMG-GI.pdf`) explicitly identifies it as GI-specific, though the form title itself ("Authorization for Release of Information") is generic and does not mention the GI department.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was found via a site-specific search (`site:wwmedgroup.com`), which returned direct PDF links. Per the retrieval notes, the search process encountered "none significant" difficulties. WWMG maintains a Medical Records Request page (https://www.wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/) and a Patient Intake and Registration Forms page (https://www.wwmedgroup.com/patient-intake-registration-forms/), both of which appear to link to downloadable forms.

The URL is descriptive and hosted on WWMG's own WordPress site (`/wp-content/uploads/`), which is a reasonable location. However, the existence of a GI-specific form alongside the main organization form could confuse patients who are unsure which form applies to them. A patient seeking to release records from a GI visit would need to know to look for this specialty-specific form rather than using the general form-1.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present and fully extractable (3,657 characters). The text reads cleanly with no OCR artifacts.

**Fillable fields**: Zero. Despite having clear form fields (patient name, date of birth, previous name, dates, signature fields), none are interactive PDF form fields. This means a patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit physically — or use a PDF annotation tool. This is a significant step backward from form-1, which has 39 fillable fields.

**File format & size**: At 122 KB for a 2-page document with 2 embedded images and 4 fonts, the file size is reasonable. The document appears to be a digitally-created PDF (not a scan), as evidenced by the clean text layer and embedded fonts.

**Digital-first design**: While the PDF was digitally created (not scanned), the lack of any fillable fields undermines its utility as a digital document. It functions essentially as a printable template.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages, which is appropriate for the amount of content. Page 1 covers the authorization fields; page 2 covers patient rights and signatures.

**Clarity**: The form uses a mix of plain language and legal phrasing. The authorization section ("I give my permission for the physician/entity listed below to disclose my health care information consistent with this authorization") is reasonably clear. However, the rights section on page 2 includes dense, legalistic passages. For example: "I understand that if the person or organization who receives information pursuant to this authorization is not a health care provider or health care provider or health plan covered by federal or state privacy laws, the information listed above could be re-disclosed by them and will no longer be protected by those regulations." This sentence also contains an apparent error — "health care provider or health care provider" is redundant.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → scope of information → sensitive information opt-in → recipient → purpose → expiration → rights → signature. This ordering is intuitive.

**Layout**: With only 4 fonts and 2 embedded images, the design is simple. The form uses checkboxes for selection fields and blank lines for free-text entries. The footer identifies the document as "Authorization for Release of Info" with the date "01/01/2023" on both pages.

**Sensitive information section**: The form uses an opt-in model for sensitive categories (HIV, psychiatric disorders, STDs, drug/alcohol use), stating: "If none of the above boxes are checked, no information related to the testing, diagnosis or treatment of the categories below will be disclosed." This is clearly communicated and appropriately protective.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This form is structured as a **release/disclosure** authorization — the patient authorizes a provider to send records TO the WWMG GI Department. The "disclose this health care information to" section is pre-filled with the GI department's address. This is not a patient access request form; it's designed for transferring records between providers. A patient requesting their own records would likely need to use form-1 instead, which explicitly includes "Personal (to patient)" as a purpose option.

**Scope options**: The form offers four scope choices:
1. "All health care information in my medical record"
2. Information "relating to the following treatment or condition" (with a write-in line)
3. Information "for the date(s)" (with a write-in field)
4. "Other (e.g., X-rays, bills), specify date(s)"

This is a reasonable set of options.

**Purpose options**: The form lists:
- "At my request"
- "Check only if for marketing purposes"
- "Check only if WWMG will be paid or get something of value for providing health information for marketing purposes"
- "Other (specify)"

The marketing-related checkboxes are unusual on a GI department transfer form and appear to be boilerplate HIPAA language rather than practically relevant options.

**Format options**: No electronic delivery options are mentioned. No email, patient portal, or digital transfer options.

**Right of Access language**: The form includes detailed HIPAA rights language on page 2, including the right to revoke authorization in writing, the right to refuse to sign without affecting treatment eligibility, and a re-disclosure warning. However, it does not cite specific HIPAA sections (e.g., 45 CFR § 164.524).

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: The form states: "This document does not permit disclosure of health information created more than 90 days after the date it is signed." The default expiration is "In 90 days for the date signed," with an option to specify a different date or event, but all are capped: "(No longer than 90 days from date signed)." A 90-day hard cap on authorization validity is restrictive. While HIPAA does not prescribe a specific expiration period, an unreasonably short window could require patients to repeatedly re-authorize ongoing transfers (e.g., for continuing care coordination).

**Fees**: The form includes a note: "***Note: there may be a charge for copying medical records, this service provided by an outside agency***". This discloses potential fees but provides no specifics about amounts, which creates uncertainty for patients.

**Revocation**: The form clearly states that revocation must be done "in writing by sending a letter to the person or organization listed above." This is acceptable under HIPAA.

**Treatment conditioning**: The form includes appropriate language that signing is not required for treatment, payment, or enrollment, with a narrow exception for research-related treatment or services "provided solely for the purpose of providing health information to someone else."

**Submission method**: The form provides no guidance on how to submit it (fax, mail, in-person, email). Unlike form-1, which directs patients to "wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request," this form offers no submission instructions.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **90-day hard cap on authorization**: The form enforces a strict maximum of 90 days regardless of patient preference: "No longer than 90 days from date signed." For ongoing care coordination, this forces patients to repeatedly re-sign authorizations. While not illegal, this is an unusual and burdensome restriction that goes beyond what most ROI forms impose.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Form purpose is unclear for patient self-access**: The form is structured as a third-party release (records TO the GI department), but its title ("Authorization for Release of Information") is generic. A patient arriving at this form looking to obtain their own records might not realize it isn't designed for that purpose.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no guidance on how or where to submit the completed authorization — no fax number for sending, no mailing address for the originating provider, no email option. The pre-filled fax/phone is the GI department's (the recipient), not the releasing provider's.
- **Fee ambiguity**: "There may be a charge for copying medical records, this service provided by an outside agency" — no amount, no fee schedule, no reference to state or federal fee limits.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Redundant/garbled text**: Page 2 contains "the person or organization who receives information pursuant to this authorization is not a health care provider or health care provider or health plan" — the phrase "health care provider" is duplicated, suggesting a copy-paste or drafting error.
- **No fillable fields despite digital creation**: The PDF was clearly created digitally (not scanned) but has zero interactive form fields, which appears to be an oversight rather than a deliberate choice, especially given that form-1 has 39 fillable fields.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Sensitive information opt-in model**: The form defaults to excluding sensitive categories (HIV, psychiatric, STDs, substance abuse) unless explicitly checked. The language is clear: "If none of the above boxes are checked, no information related to the testing, diagnosis or treatment of the categories below will be disclosed." This is a well-designed privacy protection.
- **Detailed patient rights section**: Page 2 provides thorough HIPAA rights language including the right to refuse, the right to revoke, and a re-disclosure warning — more comprehensive than many ROI forms.
