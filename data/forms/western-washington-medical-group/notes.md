# Western Washington Medical Group — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG)
- **Website**: https://www.wwmedgroup.com
- **Location**: Everett, WA
- **Type**: Independent physician practice (for-profit)

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release form PDF**: Searched for `Western Washington Medical Group Everett WA "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`. Did not return direct PDF links but pointed toward the WWMG website.

2. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:wwmedgroup.com "medical records" "release form"`. This was highly effective — returned direct links to two PDF forms on wwmedgroup.com and identified their medical records request page.

3. **Follow-up search for additional forms**: Found a third form hosted on PatientPop (sa1s3.patientpop.com), likely from a prior version of their website or a different practice within the group.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The forms were readily available on the WWMG website. The site-specific search was effective and returned direct PDF links. No bot blocking or login walls encountered.
