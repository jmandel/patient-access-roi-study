## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.adena.org/docs/default-source/billing-and-financial/medical-release-form.pdf?sfvrsn=2caf85b8_0`
- **File size:** 131,031 bytes
- **Description:** "AUTHORIZATION: RELEASE OF INFORMATION FORM" (CLI.1777, Rev. 10/25). This appears to be the current/updated version of the ROI form. It is a text-based PDF with standard authorization fields including patient info, record types, purpose of disclosure, and signature areas. Notably includes an option to request records in electronic format via email.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.adena.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/authorization-for-roi-final---2020-09-02.pdf?sfvrsn=9e3ecc80_3`
- **File size:** 580,303 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization: Release of Information Form" — an older version of the ROI form (dated 2020-09-02 in the filename). Linked from the "Option 3 - By Mail or Fax" section of the medical records request page. Similar content to form-1 but slightly different layout and address (272 Hospital Road vs. 110 Vaughn Lane). Single page.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://www.adena.org/docs/default-source/billing-and-financial/2025-release-of-information-pay-schedule_adena-patient-letter.pdf?sfvrsn=176dbece_1`
- **File size:** 638,906 bytes
- **Description:** 2025 Release of Information fee schedule / patient letter. Image-only scan (no text layer, no embedded fonts). Linked from the top of the medical records request page under "Medical Records Fees."

## Difficulties
- None significant. The forms were straightforward to find via web search and were directly downloadable as PDFs without bot blocking or JavaScript rendering issues.
- The medical records page links two different versions of the authorization form — one from the billing/financial section (form-1, newer revision 10/25) and one from the default document library (form-2, dated 2020). It's unclear which one the organization considers current.
- The fee schedule (form-3) is an image-only scan with no text layer.

## Retrieval Difficulty
Easy — forms were found on the first search and downloadable directly.
