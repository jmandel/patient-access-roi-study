# Huntington Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Huntington Hospital
- **Website**: https://huntington.northwell.edu/
- **Location**: Huntington, NY
- **Parent System**: Northwell Health

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for Huntington Hospital + authorization + release + health information + PDF**: Initial results conflated with Huntington Hospital in California (Huntington Health). Clarified by adding "Northwell" to searches.

2. **Web search for Northwell Health ROI form**: Found direct PDF links on northwell.edu. Northwell publishes system-wide forms used across all their facilities including Huntington Hospital.

3. **Web search for site:huntington.northwell.edu medical records**: Found that Huntington Hospital directs patients to the Northwell Health system-level forms. Also discovered a separate "Request for Access" form specifically for patient self-requests (distinct from the general third-party ROI form).

## What Worked
Searching for the parent system (Northwell Health) forms was the most effective strategy. Huntington Hospital does not publish its own facility-specific forms — it uses Northwell's system-wide forms hosted at northwell.edu.

## Difficulties
- Initial search results confused Huntington Hospital (NY/Northwell) with Huntington Hospital (CA/Huntington Health). Resolved by including "Northwell" in queries.
- No facility-specific forms exist — all forms are system-level Northwell Health documents.

## Key Observations
- Northwell Health maintains two distinct form types: a general "Authorization for Release" (third-party) and a patient-specific "Request for Access" form.
- The patient access form (form-3) explicitly cites HIPAA 45 CFR 164.524, which is a positive compliance signal.
- Both forms offer multiple delivery formats including electronic options (secure/unsecure email, USB, CD, fax).
- Forms appear to be fillable PDFs with checkboxes and text fields.
- Retrieval difficulty: **easy** — forms are directly linked from the Northwell Health medical records page.
