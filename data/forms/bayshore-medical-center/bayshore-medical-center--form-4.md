# Bayshore Medical Center — form-4.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-4.pdf is a **Request for Amendment of Protected Health Information** form — it is *not* a Release of Information (ROI) or authorization form. It is identified as form 10711X (dated 4-29-25) and is a system-wide Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) document, not specific to Bayshore Medical Center alone. However, Bayshore is explicitly listed as one of the selectable "Location of Services" checkboxes.

In context of the six forms retrieved for this organization:
- **form-1.pdf**: HMH Medical Group outpatient ROI form (dated March 2018)
- **form-2.pdf**: Pascack Valley ROI form (image-only scan, sister facility)
- **form-3.pdf**: Spanish-language hospital-level ROI form (CMR-003S)
- **form-4.pdf** (this document): Amendment request form — a distinct HIPAA right (§ 164.526), not a records release
- **form-5.pdf**: Pascack Valley patient request form (sister facility)
- **form-6.pdf**: English hospital-level ROI form (CMR-003) — the primary ROI form

This form exercises a different HIPAA right than the ROI forms. It covers the right to request amendments to one's medical record under 45 CFR § 164.526, rather than the right of access under § 164.524.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found linked from the HMH system-wide Medical Records page under a "Records Amendment" link. This is a **relatively discoverable** pathway — a patient visiting the Medical Records page would see it as a labeled option. The URL (`/files/patients-visitors/request-amendment-of-information.pdf`) is descriptive and located in a logical directory structure.

However, the form is only available via the parent system's website, not from Bayshore's own facility page. A patient starting at the Bayshore Medical Center page would need to navigate to the HMH system-level Medical Records page first. The filename `request-amendment-of-information.pdf` is clear and self-describing.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (6,041 characters across 2 pages). Not an image-only scan.

**Fillable fields**: The form has **54 fillable fields**, which is notably strong. This is the highest fillable field count among all six downloaded forms (form-6, the primary ROI form, has zero fillable fields). This suggests the amendment form was designed as a digital-first document that patients can complete electronically.

**File size**: 93 KB for 2 pages — very compact and efficient. No embedded images.

**Fonts**: 8 fonts are used, which is moderately high but not excessive.

**PDF structure**: The form appears to be a natively digital PDF, not a scan. The combination of text layer, fillable fields, zero embedded images, and compact file size all point to a document designed for digital use.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages, which is appropriate for an amendment request form. Page 1 contains the explanatory text, patient information fields, facility selection checkboxes, and the amendment request narrative fields. Page 2 contains the acknowledgment statements, signature section, and representative/proxy information.

**Clarity**: The opening paragraph is written in relatively plain language: *"As a patient, you have the right to request that protected health information about you that is maintained by Hackensack Meridian Health be amended if you believe it is incorrect or incomplete."* This clearly explains the purpose and sets patient expectations. The form then explains the 60-day response timeline and the patient's right to submit a statement of disagreement if denied.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow:
1. Explanatory text about the right and process
2. Patient identification fields
3. Facility selection (11 named locations plus "Other")
4. Date range for records to be amended
5. Narrative fields: what is incorrect and what the correct information should be
6. Acknowledgment and signature
7. Representative/proxy section with authority types
8. Submission instructions

**Readability**: The form text is clear but dense in places. The acknowledgment on page 2 — *"I understand that Hackensack Meridian Health may or may not approve this request. I also understand that Hackensack Meridian Health is not able to alter the original documentation in a record under any circumstances."* — is important but could be more prominent.

**Submission instructions**: The form provides clear submission channels: email (PatientAmendment@hmhn.org), fax (732-951-7947), and mail (Director of Health Information, 100 Tormee Drive, Second Floor, Office #838, Tinton Falls, NJ 07712). Email submission is mentioned twice — once early in the explanatory text and once at the bottom.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Right exercised**: This form addresses the HIPAA right to request amendment (§ 164.526), which is a less commonly encountered but important patient right. Its mere availability online is a positive signal.

**Explanation of process**: The form does a reasonable job explaining what happens after submission: the provider has 60 days to respond (extendable by 30 days with written notice), and if denied, the patient can submit a statement of disagreement. This helps set expectations.

**Scope**: The form asks patients to specify both *what* information is incorrect and *what it should say*, which are the two key pieces of information needed for an amendment request. Date range fields help narrow the scope.

**Electronic submission**: Email submission is available (PatientAmendment@hmhn.org), which is a positive feature for patient convenience. No patient portal integration is mentioned.

**Representative access**: The form has a detailed proxy/representative section listing 8 categories of authorized representatives (parent, kinship care relative, court-appointed guardian, healthcare agent, medical POA, general POA, surrogate decision maker, personal representative of deceased). Each category includes a parenthetical note about substance abuse record limitations — e.g., *"Parent with Parental rights (not sufficient for substance abuse records)"* — which shows attention to New Jersey and federal law nuances.

**Identity verification**: The form states *"verification of identity is required"* but does not specify what form of verification is needed, which could create confusion or become a barrier if interpreted strictly.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No notarization required**: The form does not require notarization.

**No in-person submission required**: Email, fax, and mail are all accepted — the form does not mandate in-person submission.

**No fees mentioned**: No fees are referenced for the amendment process itself, which is correct (HIPAA does not permit charging for amendment requests).

**Proof of authority**: The form states *"You MUST attach proof of your authority to act on behalf of the patient as checked above (other than parent)."* The "MUST" emphasis and the exemption for parents are reasonable and comply with legal requirements for representative verification.

**Timeframe**: The form accurately reflects HIPAA's 60-day response requirement with a possible 30-day extension, which is correct under § 164.526(b)(2).

**Future date anomaly**: The form ID includes the date "4-29-25" — this appears to be April 29, 2025, which would be a future date relative to the study context. This may indicate a draft or pre-release version, or the date convention used (e.g., effective date rather than creation date).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **54 fillable form fields** — the highest among all six forms retrieved for this organization. This stands in stark contrast to the primary ROI form (form-6, CMR-003) which has zero fillable fields. The amendment form is clearly designed for digital completion.
- **Email submission option** with a dedicated amendment-specific email address (PatientAmendment@hmhn.org) — shows a purpose-built workflow rather than a generic intake process.
- **Clear process explanation** in the opening paragraphs, including the 60-day timeline and the right to submit a statement of disagreement upon denial.
- **Detailed representative categories** with substance abuse record carve-outs showing attention to NJ-specific confidentiality protections.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Verification of identity is required"** — the form states this requirement but provides no guidance on what constitutes acceptable verification. A patient submitting by email or mail would not know whether to include a photo ID copy, notarized statement, or something else.
- **"Hackensack Meridian Health is not able to alter the original documentation in a record under any circumstances"** — while technically accurate (amendments are addended, not deleted), this language could discourage patients who don't understand that an amendment means adding a correction, not changing the original entry.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Form date "4-29-25"** appears to be a future date (April 29, 2025), suggesting this may be a pre-release or incorrectly dated version. This is unusual for a publicly available form.
- **Internal Use section repeated** on both pages with an identical "Date Received" field — while intentional for multi-page processing, it consumes space on the patient-facing form that could be better utilized.
