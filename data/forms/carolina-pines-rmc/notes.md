## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF**: Searched `"Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — did not return a direct hit initially.
2. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:cprmc.com medical records release authorization` — returned direct links to both the English and Spanish PDF forms hosted on cprmc.com.
3. **Medical records page**: Visited https://www.cprmc.com/medical-records — confirmed the forms and provided submission instructions (in-person, fax, email).

**What worked:** The site-specific web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URLs. The organization's medical records page is straightforward and links directly to the forms.
