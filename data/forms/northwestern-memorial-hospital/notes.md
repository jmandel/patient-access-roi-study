### form-1.pdf

- **File size**: 364,835 bytes
- **Description**: "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" — the primary ROI form (English). A 2-page form covering patient information, hospital/physician group selection (all NMHC entities), purpose of release, types of medical records requested, dates of service, and method of delivery. Includes options for MyNM portal, fax, email, US mail (CD or paper). Form number 8094, revised 2/2026.
- **Initial impression**: This is the main patient-facing ROI form. It appears to be a fillable PDF with checkboxes and text fields. It's a system-wide form covering all Northwestern Memorial HealthCare hospitals and physician groups.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.nm.org/-/media/northwestern/resources/patients-and-visitors/northwestern-medicine-authorization-to-obtain-information.pdf

- **Initial impression**: This is the reverse direction — it's for obtaining records FROM other providers, not for releasing Northwestern's records. Still relevant to the study as it shows the organization's complete medical records request ecosystem.
