## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records" form branded under **UAB St. Vincent's**, dated February 2026. It serves as the current ROI authorization form for UAB St. Vincent's hospital system, which includes the facility formerly known as Ascension St. Vincent's East.

This form exists alongside an older **form-1.pdf** — the legacy Ascension St. Vincent's "Authorization To Disclose Protected Health Information" (revised February 2022, ~2.8 MB). The two forms reflect a branding/organizational transition: Ascension St. Vincent's has partnered with or been rebranded under UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Form-2 is the current, active version; form-1 appears to be the superseded predecessor. Notably, form-2 explicitly lists "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department" as one of six selectable locations, confirming it is the applicable form for this facility.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The retrieval notes indicate this form was **not** found through the most obvious searches. Initial searches for "Ascension St. Vincent's East" authorization forms yielded Ascension system-wide forms from other states (Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas, Wisconsin, Michigan) but not Alabama-specific ones. An Alabama-specific search found the older Ascension-branded form-1. Only a separate search for "UAB St. Vincent's" forms found this current version on the `uabstvincents.org` domain.

The URL is long but descriptive: the filename contains the document title and date. The form directs patients to submit completed forms via `https://uabstvincents.org/billing/medical-records-request/`, suggesting there is a dedicated Medical Records Request page on the UAB St. Vincent's website.

The branding transition between Ascension and UAB creates a significant findability challenge. A patient who knows the facility as "Ascension St. Vincent's East" would likely search under that name and find only the outdated 2022 form. The current form lives on a different domain (`uabstvincents.org` vs. `healthcare.ascension.org`) under a different organizational name.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (5,525 characters).
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. Despite being a digital-origin document, there are no interactive form fields. All blanks are represented by underscores.
- **File size**: 143 KB for 2 pages — reasonable and appropriate.
- **Font count**: 9 fonts — typical for a designed PDF.
- **Embedded images**: 64 images in a 2-page document is surprisingly high, suggesting extensive use of decorative elements, logos, or checkboxes rendered as images rather than native form elements.
- **Scan vs. digital**: This is a digital-first document — not a scan. The text is clean and well-structured. Compared to form-1 (2.8 MB, 38 fonts, likely containing scanned elements), this is a significant improvement.
- **Format**: The form must be printed, filled by hand, and returned. The submission instructions point to a website for the mailing address, but there is no mention of electronic submission of the form itself.

The form is technically adequate as a digital artifact (clean text, small file) but misses the opportunity to be a fillable PDF. The 64 embedded images for a 2-page form is unusual and may indicate that checkboxes and other interactive elements are rendered as images, which would impair screen reader accessibility.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — proportionate for the content covered.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow:
1. Opening authorization statement and sensitive-information disclosure notice
2. Patient demographics
3. Recipient designation (self or third party)
4. Location selection
5. Psychiatric/substance use records opt-in
6. Date range
7. Record type selection
8. Delivery method selection
9. Acknowledgment initials (revocation rights, non-conditioning)
10. Expiration date and signature

**Clarity**: The opening paragraph is dense: "I hereby authorize the use or disclosure of my protected health information ("PHI") as described below. This request includes any information relating to drug, alcohol use/treatment, communications with psychiatrists or psychologists, and records pertaining to sexually transmitted diseases, if they are a part of my medical record." This front-loads complex legal concepts before the patient even fills in their name. The sentence about re-disclosure ("Once this information has been disclosed, it may be subject to re-disclosure and no longer be protected by federal regulations") is standard but adds to the legal density.

The record type section is well-structured, offering a sensible hierarchy: "Key Clinical Notes" (a pre-defined bundle), "Entire Medical Record," or specific individual report types. The parenthetical "(excluding billing records, Fetal Monitoring, and Radiology images)" under "Entire Medical Record" is a helpful clarification.

**Layout**: The form uses horizontal rules to separate major sections. Checkbox-style selectors are used throughout. The delivery section on page 2 is laid out in a two-column format (options on the left, electronic records notice on the right), which is a reasonable use of space.

**Font size**: Based on the clean text extraction and the amount of content fitting on 2 pages, text appears to be at a readable size (likely 10pt or above).

**Initialing requirements**: The form requires patients to initial two separate statements about revocation rights and non-conditioning of treatment. These statements are lengthy — the non-conditioning statement includes three bullet-pointed exceptions. While legally thorough, requiring a patient to initial these dense paragraphs creates friction and may not improve comprehension.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form explicitly includes a checkbox for "me for my personal use" alongside "the party indicated below." This is a meaningful improvement over many ROI forms that are exclusively third-party-oriented. The legacy form-1 lists "Patient / Personal Representative" as one of several purpose checkboxes but frames the entire form as a disclosure authorization *to* a receiving facility.

**Scope options**: Patients can specify:
- Specific UAB St. Vincent's locations (6 options including East)
- Date range (from/to or specific date), with a default of "past 12 months" if unspecified
- Whether to include psychiatric/substance use records (Yes/No checkbox)
- Record type with three tiers: curated key clinical notes, entire medical record, or specific report types (10 options)

**Format/delivery options**: The form offers five delivery methods:
- Paper mailed to address on form
- Paper pickup by a named person
- Fax
- CD (mailed only)
- Email

The email/CD option includes a clear notice about encryption: "I understand that the records will be encrypted to help protect my privacy and the security of my health records and that I will be furnished with the information on how to access those encrypted records." This is both transparent and patient-friendly.

**Right of Access language**: The form does **not** reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. This is a notable omission — the older form-1 explicitly states "I may inspect or obtain a copy of the information to be used or disclosed, as provided in CFR 164.524." The newer form drops this reference.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or TEFCA.

**Fees**: No fee information is disclosed on the form. Patients are not told what, if anything, records will cost.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: "This Authorization will expire on: _____. If I fail to specify an expiration date or event, this Authorization will expire six months from the date on which it was signed." A 6-month default expiration is standard and not unreasonably short for a single-use records request.

**Revocation**: The form addresses revocation rights clearly, requiring the patient to initial acknowledgment. Revocation must be provided "in writing" to "the entity privacy coordinator" — this is standard.

**Non-conditioning**: The form requires the patient to initial a statement that treatment will not be conditioned on signing, with appropriate exceptions for research, health plan enrollment, and third-party-requested treatment. This is compliant with HIPAA requirements.

**No notarization requirement**: Unlike form-1, which includes a "For External Use Only" section listing identity verification methods including "Notarized signature," form-2 has no notarization requirement or identity verification section visible on the form.

**No witness requirement**: Form-2 requires only the patient's signature. Form-1 required both patient signature and a witness signature.

**Sensitive records opt-in**: The form asks patients to affirmatively choose whether to include psychiatric/substance use records, with a Yes/No checkbox. This is compliant with 42 CFR Part 2 for substance use records and state-level psychiatric record protections.

**Broad initial authorization language**: The opening paragraph states that the request "includes any information relating to drug, alcohol use/treatment, communications with psychiatrists or psychologists, and records pertaining to sexually transmitted diseases, if they are a part of my medical record." This broadly sweeping statement at the top of the form appears to conflict with the later Yes/No checkbox for psychiatric/substance use records — the opening seems to include them by default while the checkbox offers a choice.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No fee disclosure**: The form provides no information about costs for records. HIPAA limits fees for patient access requests, and patients should know what to expect before submitting a request. The absence of any fee information — even a reference to a fee schedule — leaves patients unable to anticipate costs.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Contradictory sensitive-records language**: The opening paragraph states the request "includes any information relating to drug, alcohol use/treatment, communications with psychiatrists or psychologists, and records pertaining to sexually transmitted diseases." But the form later asks: "Are you requesting psychiatric or substance use records to be included in the release? Yes / No." If the opening paragraph already includes them, what does checking "No" accomplish? This creates confusion about whether sensitive records are included by default or only upon affirmative request.

- **Submission instructions are indirect**: The form states "Return Completed Form: Visit our website for the mailing address: https://uabstvincents.org/billing/medical-records-request/" — rather than printing the mailing address directly on the form. A patient who prints the form and fills it out by hand must then go online to find where to send it.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Dropped HIPAA Right of Access reference**: The older Ascension form-1 cited "CFR 164.524" — the patient's right to inspect or obtain a copy of their health information. The newer UAB form-2 eliminates this reference entirely. While not technically an error, removing a patient-rights citation during a form revision is a regression.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Explicit "personal use" checkbox**: The form clearly distinguishes between "me for my personal use" and third-party disclosure. Many ROI forms are oriented entirely toward third-party release, making the patient's own access request feel like a secondary use case. This form treats patient access as a first-class option.

- **Tiered record selection**: The "Key Clinical Notes" option — defined as "discharge summary, operative reports, labs and radiology reports, Emergency Department provider documentation" — provides a sensible default for patients who want their important records without needing to understand every report type. This is a genuine usability improvement over forms that only offer individual report types or "entire record."

- **Encryption notice for electronic delivery**: The statement about encrypted electronic records is clear, honest about the limits of responsibility after receipt, and promises the patient will receive instructions for accessing encrypted records. This is transparent and practical.

- **Facility location selector**: Listing specific UAB St. Vincent's facilities allows patients to target their request to the correct location, reducing processing delays and misdirected requests.
