# Ascension St. Vincent's East — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for facility-specific form**: Searched for `Ascension St. Vincent's East Birmingham Alabama "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`. Did not yield a direct link to the facility-specific form but revealed that Ascension uses regional forms.

2. **Web search for Ascension system-wide forms**: Searched for `Ascension "medical records" "release form" "authorization" PDF download`. Found several regional Ascension forms (Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas, Wisconsin, Michigan) but not Alabama-specific.

3. **Web search for Alabama-specific form**: Searched for `Ascension St. Vincent's Alabama medical records request form PDF authorization release`. This found the direct PDF link to the Alabama authorization form on healthcare.ascension.org.

4. **Web search for UAB St. Vincent's forms**: Ascension St. Vincent's has recently been rebranded/merged with UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Searched `uabstvincents.org medical records request form authorization PDF download` and found a newer January 2026 form on the UAB St. Vincent's website.

- **Document type**: Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information
- **Description**: Ascension St. Vincent's branded ROI form (revised February 2022). 2-page form with fields for TO/FROM facility, patient demographics, record type checkboxes (facesheet, discharge summary, H&P, ED record, consultation, operative report, etc.), purpose of disclosure, and signature blocks. Includes options for pickup, US mail, or electronic delivery via email. References CFR 164.524 (right to inspect/copy). Has external-use section for identity verification (driver's license, SSN, notarized signature, etc.). This appears to be the legacy Ascension-era form, now likely superseded by the UAB version.

- **Description**: UAB St. Vincent's branded ROI form (February 2026). 2-page form. Includes checkbox for patient's personal use vs. third-party release. Lists specific UAB St. Vincent's locations including "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department". Offers multiple record type options (key clinical notes, entire medical record, specific reports). Delivery options include paper (mailed or pickup), fax, CD, or email with encryption notice. Includes initialing requirements for revocation rights and non-conditioning of treatment. 6-month default expiration. This is the current, most relevant form for this facility.

## Difficulties

- The facility is part of the Ascension system, which recently partnered with/was rebranded to UAB St. Vincent's. This means there are two different forms from two different eras.
- The older Ascension form (form-1.pdf) is much larger (~2.8 MB vs ~140 KB), likely because it contains embedded images/scanned elements.
- The newer UAB form (form-2.pdf) is cleaner, smaller, and appears to be a digital-first document.
- No difficulty with download — both PDFs were directly accessible via curl without bot blocking.
