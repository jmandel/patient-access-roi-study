# Mankato Clinic — form-1.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information," a 2-page PDF (form ID MC032, revision 02/23). Page 1 is the authorization form itself; page 2 is a full page of "Authorization Instructions" that walks the patient through each section of page 1. The form is a **general-purpose ROI authorization** — it covers both patient-to-patient requests and third-party releases, with no distinct pathway for a patient simply requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access.

A second form (form-2.pdf, MC032 dated 07/20) is an older version of the same document. The two share identical structure and legal boilerplate, with minor label updates in form-1 (e.g., "Clinic/Hospital notes" replaces "Clinic/Hospital records," "Radiology reports" replaces "X-ray reports," and "mental health/substance abuse" replaces "mental health notes"). Form-1 also drops the "Witnessed by" signature line present in form-2. Both are hosted simultaneously on the Mankato Clinic website.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was easy to locate. Per the retrieval notes, the very first web search for `Mankato Clinic "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` surfaced direct PDF links. Mankato Clinic maintains a dedicated Release of Information page at `https://www.mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/` that links to the form. The PDF URL is descriptive (`Release-of-Information-Authorization-MC032.pdf`). The ROI page also provides phone, fax, and email contact information and notes that an online medical record request tool is separately available. No login wall, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking was encountered. Finding the form required essentially a single web search — a strong result.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (6,103 characters), and the text reads cleanly with no OCR artifacts.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. Despite being a digitally authored PDF (not a scan), there are no interactive form fields. Every field must be printed and handwritten, or completed in a separate editor and overlaid. This is a significant missed opportunity for a PDF version 1.7 document with 9 fonts and 2 embedded images.
- **File size**: 227,631 bytes (~222 KB) for 2 pages — reasonable, though slightly large given the lack of fillable fields; the 2 embedded images (likely a logo) account for much of the size.
- **Digital-first design**: Partially. The document was clearly created digitally (not scanned), but it is designed as a print-and-fill form. The instructions page states "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized," which pushes patients toward paper even if they could otherwise fill the PDF digitally. The organization does separately offer a DocuSign and online request option, but these are not part of the form itself.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — appropriate. Page 1 is the authorization; page 2 is detailed instructions. The instruction page is a genuine value-add, not filler.

**Clarity**: The form uses reasonably plain language. Section headers like "Release my medical records from" and "Share my medical records with" are patient-friendly and more intuitive than the older form-2's "Health Care Facility / Provider" and "Requestor" labels. The legal boilerplate at the bottom of page 1 is clear and well-structured, covering authorization duration, treatment-conditioning exceptions, and re-disclosure risk in three readable sentences.

**Organization**: Logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → source of records → destination → information type → reason → signature. Each section is labeled with a sidebar descriptor and a bolded question ("WHO HAS INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE RELEASED?"), which helps orientation.

**Layout**: The form is moderately dense. Patient demographic fields (Name, DOB, Address, Phone, City, State, Zip, Previous Name, MR#) take up the top section. The checkboxes for record types are tightly packed but readable. Contact information for three ROI locations (Main, Wick/CHC, North) is listed at the top with phone and fax numbers.

**Record type checkboxes** (11 options): Past 2 years of records, Clinic/Hospital notes, Radiology reports, Radiology films/CD/other, Lab/Pathology Reports, Immunizations, HIV/AIDS records, Financial/Billing, Mental health/substance abuse, Last colonoscopy/mammogram/Pap/eye exam, Communication (Verbal/Written). There is also a free-text field for "Records concerning: ___ Specific Diagnosis or Treatment and Specific Dates of Service."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting records. A patient requesting their own records must still fill out both the "Release my medical records from" (identifying Mankato Clinic) and "Share my medical records with" (identifying themselves) sections. This is unnecessarily confusing for self-requests. There is no mention of HIPAA § 164.524, the Right of Access, or patient rights generally — it is framed entirely as a release/disclosure authorization.

**Scope options**: Good. Patients can select specific record types via checkboxes, specify a diagnosis or treatment, and indicate date ranges. The "Past 2 years of records" checkbox provides a convenient default. The "Last colonoscopy, mammogram, Pap, eye exam" option is a thoughtful inclusion for preventive care continuity.

**Format/delivery options**: The form offers "COPIES: GIVEN / MAILED / FAXED ON: ___ / CALL WHEN READY / PICK UP" — all physical delivery methods. No electronic delivery option (email, patient portal, secure link) is mentioned on the form itself. The instructions page reinforces this by stating nothing about electronic delivery (the older form-2 instructions explicitly stated "Medical records are not able to be emailed"). The separately available online request tool is not referenced on the form.

**Turnaround**: The instructions note "Please expect at least 7-10 business days from receipt of your request for processing; exceptions are made for emergent circumstances." HIPAA requires a 30-day response window, so this is reasonable.

**Fees**: The authorization text states "I understand there may be a charge associated with the Release of Information services rendered" but does not disclose the fee schedule. Patients are not told what charges to expect.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Authorization expiration**: 12 months from signature date, with written revocation possible at any time. This is standard and reasonable.
- **Treatment conditioning**: The form correctly states that Mankato Clinic "will not condition my treatment on whether I sign this authorization form" with two HIPAA-recognized exceptions (research and fitness-for-work exams). This is compliant language.
- **Re-disclosure warning**: Present ("Mankato Clinic cannot prevent the re-disclosure of the information to another third party").
- **Photocopies accepted**: "A photocopy of this authorization will be treated in the same manner as original" — removes a potential barrier.
- **Typed signature restriction**: The instructions state "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized." This effectively requires wet-ink signatures for the paper form pathway.
- **Photo ID for pickup**: "Please bring a photo ID with you in order to pick up medical records" — reasonable identity verification.
- **No re-release policy**: "Mankato Clinic does not re-release medical records from other facilities" — this is stated clearly in the instructions.
- **No mention of patient's right to receive records**: The form does not inform patients that they have a right under HIPAA to obtain a copy of their records, or that the provider is obligated to fulfill the request within 30 days.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No fillable fields on a digitally authored PDF**: Despite being created natively in a PDF editor (not scanned), form-1 has zero interactive form fields. Combined with the policy that "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized," patients are effectively forced into a print → hand-fill → scan/fax/mail workflow. This creates an unnecessary friction barrier.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: The statement "I understand there may be a charge associated with the Release of Information services rendered" provides no specifics. Under HIPAA, fees for patient access copies are limited to reasonable, cost-based fees, and patients should be informed of charges before incurring them.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Patient self-request workflow is unclear**: The form's two-party structure ("Release my medical records from" / "Share my medical records with") implies a third-party release scenario. A patient requesting their own records would need to list Mankato Clinic as the source and themselves as the destination, but this isn't explained anywhere — not even on the instruction page. The instructions say "Where would you like your records sent? Who would you like to have access to your records?" which doesn't clearly address "I want my own records."
- **Two versions of the same form hosted simultaneously**: Both form-1 (02/23) and form-2 (07/20) are live on the website. While the notes indicate form-1 appears to be the current version, a patient could encounter either. The differences are minor but could cause confusion if staff expect one version over the other.
- **"No records needed at this time; keep on file" checkbox**: This option is present under "Reason for the Release" but its purpose is ambiguous — it appears to allow a pre-signed authorization with no immediate records request, which could raise questions about how long such a blanket authorization remains meaningful within the 12-month window.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated instruction page**: Page 2 provides section-by-section guidance for completing the form, which is uncommon and genuinely helpful. It explains what each field means and provides practical tips like "We prioritize requests by appointment date."
- **Multiple ROI contact points**: The form lists three separate ROI departments (Main, Wick/CHC, North) with dedicated phone and fax numbers, plus an email address (ROI@mankato-clinic.com). This gives patients several channels to reach the right team.
- **Accepts any HIPAA-compliant form**: The instructions state "Any HIPAA compliant authorization form can be used," explicitly accepting alternatives including the Minnesota Standard Consent Form. This reduces barriers for patients who may already have a completed form from another source.
- **Modernized patient-friendly labels**: The update from form-2's clinical language ("Health Care Facility / Provider" / "Requestor") to form-1's plain-language labels ("Release my medical records from" / "Share my medical records with") shows intentional effort to improve readability.
