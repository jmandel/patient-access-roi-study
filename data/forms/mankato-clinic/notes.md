# Mankato Clinic — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies
- **Web search** for `Mankato Clinic "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links and the ROI information page.
- **Web search** for `Mankato Clinic "medical records" "release form" PDF` — confirmed the same URLs plus an older version of the form.
- **Site-specific search** for `site:mankatoclinic.com authorization release medical records` — found the dedicated Release of Information page with instructions.

The first web search was sufficient to locate the form. Mankato Clinic makes their ROI form readily available on their website at https://www.mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/.
