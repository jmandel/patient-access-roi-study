## Downloaded PDFs

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.neshobageneral.com/documents/Employer-Authorization-Form_Fillable.pdf
- **What it is**: Employer Authorization Form for occupational health services (DOT physicals, pre-employment physicals, return to work physicals). This is NOT an ROI/medical records release form — it is a form employers use to authorize employee visits for workplace-related medical services.
- **Why downloaded**: It was the closest thing to an "authorization form" found on the site. Downloaded for completeness.

## Conclusion

**No ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form was found online for Neshoba General Hospital.** The hospital does not publish any patient-facing medical records release form on their website. The website has no dedicated "Medical Records" or "Health Information Management" page. The only way to obtain an ROI form appears to be by contacting the hospital directly by phone at (601) 663-1200 or visiting in person.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The hospital's website is minimal, built by Scorpion Healthcare Marketing, and lacks many standard patient resources sections
- No "Medical Records" or "HIM" department page exists
- No HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices PDF is published on the website (only a generic website privacy policy)
- The hospital is independent (not part of a larger system) so there's no parent system website to check
- The patient portal (Cerner/HealtheLife) is behind login and doesn't provide downloadable forms publicly
