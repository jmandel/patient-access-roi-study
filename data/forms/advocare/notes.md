# Advocare, LLC — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Advocare, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.advocaredoctors.com
- **Location:** Marlton, NJ
- **Type:** Independent physician practice, for-profit, Northeast

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF with authorization/release keywords** — General search results didn't return direct PDF links, but the `site:advocaredoctors.com` search yielded excellent results including a direct link to the medical records page and a CDN-hosted PDF from an individual Advocare practice site.

2. **Navigating the official website** — The medical records page (https://www.advocaredoctors.com/medical-records) is well-organized and clearly links to:
   - Online request via ShareCare platform
   - Downloadable authorization forms (English and Spanish)
   - Third-party requester portal

3. **What worked best:** The `site:advocaredoctors.com authorization release medical records` search immediately surfaced the medical records page, which had direct download links.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://irp.cdn-website.com/b4ec96c9/files/uploaded/ADVOCARE-Authorization-for-Use-and-Disclosure-of-Protected-Health-Information%28v2_4-21%29.pdf`
- **File size:** 189,083 bytes
- **Pages:** 1
- **Description:** Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information. This appears to be an older version (v2, dated 4-21) hosted on a different CDN subdirectory (b4ec96c9), likely from an individual Advocare practice's website. Single-page form with checkboxes for record types (complete health records, discharge summary, H&P, consult reports, mental health, progress notes, labs, x-rays, photos, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS). Includes expiration date field (defaults to 6 months), revocation rights, and release from liability language. Specifically branded as "Advocare, LLC."

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://irp.cdn-website.com/ddaae316/files/uploaded/Advocare+Authorization+for+Use+Disclosure+of+Protected+Health+Information.pdf`
- **File size:** 122,505 bytes
- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information (English). This is the current version linked from the official Advocare medical records page. Two-page form with more detailed fields including sending provider and recipient fields. This appears to be the primary/current ROI form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** `https://irp.cdn-website.com/ddaae316/files/uploaded/AUTHORIZATION+FOR+USE+and+DISCLOSURE_January+2024_Spanish-3ad42c14.pdf`

- **Pages:** 2
- **Description:** Spanish-language version of the authorization form (AUTORIZACIÓN PARA EL USO O DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN DE SALUD PROTEGIDA). Dated January 2024. Same content as form-2 but in Spanish. Linked from the official medical records page.

## Difficulties
- **None significant.** Advocare makes their forms easily accessible. The medical records page is straightforward to find and the PDFs download without any bot blocking or authentication requirements.
- The only minor note is that searching found an older version of the form (form-1.pdf) hosted on what appears to be an individual practice's CDN path, which differs slightly from the current official version (form-2.pdf).

## Summary
Advocare provides good online access to their ROI forms. The medical records page offers both online submission (via ShareCare) and downloadable PDF forms in English and Spanish. The retrieval difficulty was **easy** — the forms were findable via web search and clearly linked from the website.
