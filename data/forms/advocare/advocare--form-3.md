# Evaluation: Advocare, LLC — form-3.pdf (Spanish-Language Authorization)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Spanish-language** version of the Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information ("AUTORIZACIÓN PARA EL USO O DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN DE SALUD PROTEGIDA"). It is a 2-page PDF (255,453 bytes), dated January 2024 ("01.2024" footer on page 2).

It is the direct Spanish translation of form-2.pdf, which is the current English-language authorization form. Both are linked from Advocare's official medical records page. A third form (form-1.pdf) is an older, single-page English version (v2, April 2021) found on a different CDN path — likely an individual practice sub-site — with slightly different content (e.g., a 6-month default expiration vs. 90 days in the current forms, fewer record-type options, and no sending-provider fields). Form-3 and form-2 share the same CDN prefix (`ddaae316`), confirming they are both current, officially published documents.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was linked directly from the Advocare medical records page (https://www.advocaredoctors.com/medical-records), which also offers an online request option via ShareCare and an English-language PDF. Per the retrieval notes, the page was easy to locate: a `site:advocaredoctors.com` search immediately surfaced it, and no bot-blocking or authentication was required. The URL is descriptive (`AUTHORIZATION+FOR+USE+and+DISCLOSURE_January+2024_Spanish-3ad42c14.pdf`), clearly indicating the language and date. Having a dedicated, labeled Spanish link on the medical records page is a meaningful accessibility measure.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — the full text is extractable (5,666 characters). This is not a scanned image.
- **Fillable fields:** 44 interactive form fields are detected. This is a fully fillable digital PDF, slightly more fields than the English counterpart (41 fields in form-2), possibly due to layout differences in the translated version.
- **Font count:** 8 fonts embedded.
- **Embedded images:** 12, which likely correspond to checkbox graphics or decorative elements.
- **File size:** 255 KB for a 2-page form — reasonable, though notably larger than the English version (122 KB). The difference is likely attributable to the 12 embedded images vs. 0 in the English form.
- **Digital-first design:** This is a born-digital, fillable PDF — not a scan. It was designed for electronic completion.

The form scores well on technical accessibility. The combination of a text layer and fillable fields means it can be completed digitally, searched, and processed by assistive technology.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages, matching the English version. Page 1 covers patient identification, sender/recipient fields, purpose, date range, and record-type checkboxes. Page 2 covers authorization terms, signature, and a reference guide for sensitive information categories. The length is proportionate.

**Record-type options:** The form offers 13 specific record categories including:
- "Resumen de la historia clínica (último año de citas médicas y procedimientos, resultados de laboratorio y resultados de diagnóstico)"
- "Historia clínica completa"
- "Registro de vacunación"
- "Informes de operaciones/procedimientos," "Gráficos de crecimiento," "Informes de consulta," "Citas médicas," "Informe cardiológico o electrocardiograma," "Informes de laboratorio," "Extractos de facturación desglosados," "Informes de diagnóstico por imagen," photographs/video, and "Otros"

**Purpose field:** Offers checkboxes for "Atención continua," "Derivación de atención," "Solicitud del paciente," and "Otra (especifique)."

**Sensitive information:** A separate section with its own reference guide addresses mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and reproductive services — each with an explanatory paragraph in the "Guía de referencia" at the bottom of page 2. The reproductive services entry cites New Jersey law ("Ley de Reproducción P.L.2022, c.51").

**Language quality:** The Spanish is generally clear and reads naturally. The introductory paragraph directly mirrors the English version: "Comprendo que esta autorización es voluntaria." The form uses straightforward field labels ("Nombre del paciente," "Fecha de nacimiento," "Domicilio"). One minor oddity: the address field includes English sub-labels in parentheses — "(Street Address)," "(City)," "(State)," "(ZIP)" — alongside the Spanish. This is a mixed-language element, though it may be intentionally bilingual for administrative processing.

**Layout:** Sender and recipient fields are presented in parallel columns, mirroring the English version's layout. The reference guide is clearly set apart at the bottom of page 2 with category-by-definition pairings.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** Like its English counterpart, this is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form. It is not specifically designed for patient self-access under the Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). The form's structure — with separate "sending provider" and "recipient" fields — is oriented toward third-party disclosure scenarios. However, it does include "Solicitud del paciente" (patient request) as a purpose option, acknowledging patient-initiated requests.

**Scope options:** Patients can specify date ranges ("De:______ A:______"), select from 13 record categories, and opt in/out of sensitive information categories. This gives meaningful control over what is disclosed.

**Format/delivery options:** The form does not mention electronic delivery, email, or portal-based access. Neither mail nor fax delivery options appear. The form is silent on how records will be delivered, which is a gap. (Note: the English version form-2 does include "Send via mail or Email" checkboxes that are absent from this Spanish translation.)

**Rights language:** The form states "Comprendo y acepto que, por ley, disponen de 30 días para atender mi solicitud" (item 4), acknowledging the 30-day legal timeline. It mentions revocation rights (item 2) and that authorization cannot be a condition of treatment (item 3). However, there is no explicit citation of HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access, nor any mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** Default expiration is 90 days from signature if no date is specified: "Si no se designa una fecha de caducidad, esta autorización vencerá en 90 días a partir de la fecha de la firma." This is a relatively short default but not unreasonable for an authorization form. It differs from the older form-1.pdf which defaulted to 6 months.

**Liability release:** The form includes a standard liability release: "Advocare, LLC, sus proveedores, empleados, miembros y representantes quedarán eximidos por la presente de toda responsabilidad legal por la divulgación de la información anterior."

**Legal representative requirements:** Guardians (other than parents) and power of attorney holders must attach supporting legal documentation — a standard and reasonable requirement.

**30-day response time:** Item 4 states: "Comprendo y acepto que, por ley, disponen de 30 días para atender mi solicitud." This aligns with HIPAA's 30-day requirement (with possible 30-day extension), though the phrasing "acepto" (I accept) subtly frames a patient right as something the patient must agree to, rather than a guarantee.

**No unreasonable barriers observed:** No notarization requirement, no in-person-only submission mandate, no upfront fee disclosure, no overly broad consent bundling.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Spanish-language availability:** Providing a professionally translated, fully fillable Spanish-language form is a meaningful accessibility measure that many healthcare organizations omit entirely. It is linked prominently from the medical records page alongside the English version.
- **Reference guide for sensitive categories:** The "Guía de referencia" at the bottom of page 2 explains each sensitive information category (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, reproductive services) in plain Spanish with a clear definition, helping patients make informed decisions about what they authorize. The citation to NJ reproductive law (P.L.2022, c.51) is a notable compliance detail.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Missing delivery options:** Unlike the English form-2 which includes "Send via mail or Email" checkboxes, this Spanish translation omits any delivery method options. A Spanish-speaking patient completing this form has no way to indicate how they want to receive their records — a functional gap compared to the English experience.
- **Mixed-language labels:** The address field includes English sub-labels in parentheses — "(Street Address)," "(City)," "(State)," "(ZIP)" — which could confuse a monolingual Spanish speaker.
- **"I accept" framing of 30-day timeline:** "Comprendo y acepto que, por ley, disponen de 30 días para atender mi solicitud" frames the legally mandated response period as something the patient "accepts," rather than a right the provider is obligated to meet.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Delivery options discrepancy:** The English form-2.pdf includes "Send via mail or Email" checkboxes and a recipient email field. These are entirely absent from this Spanish translation. This is not merely an ambiguity — it is a functional omission that creates an unequal experience for Spanish-speaking patients.
- **Double colon typo:** The text reads "Finalidad de la solicitud de expedientes::" (two colons), a minor formatting error.
