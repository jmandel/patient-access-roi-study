## Search Strategies

### Web searches
1. `"Troy Regional Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — No direct PDF results
2. `"Troy Regional Medical Center" Troy AL "medical records" "release form"` — Found reference to old FastHealth site (trmc.fasthealth.com) with ROI page
3. `site:troymedicalcenter.com medical records release authorization` — No form found on current site
4. `Troy Regional Medical Center Troy Alabama release of information form PDF download` — Confirmed form exists on old FastHealth site, not on current site

### Website navigation
- Current site (troymedicalcenter.com) has a "Patients & Visitors" section but it lacks a medical records or HIM page
- The Patient Info page returned a 502 Bad Gateway error
- The sitemap confirmed no medical records or ROI-related pages exist on the current WordPress site
- Privacy Policy page exists but contains only the HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (no downloadable form)
- Patient Portal links to external site (thrivepatientportal.com)

### Old website
- Found the ROI form on the legacy FastHealth site: http://trmc.fasthealth.com/getpage.php?name=releaseofinfo
- This page links to a downloadable PDF: http://trmc.fasthealth.com/docs/Release_of_Information_-_Feb._2015.pdf

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** http://trmc.fasthealth.com/docs/Release_of_Information_-_Feb._2015.pdf
- **Document type:** Release of Information form (image-only scan)
- **File size:** 367,105 bytes (358 KB)
- **Pages:** 1
- **Text layer:** No — image-only scan (grayscale JPEG image at 200 DPI)
- **Fillable fields:** None
- **Notes:** This is a scanned paper form dated February 2015. The PDF contains a single full-page grayscale image with no extractable text. It was found only on the old FastHealth-hosted website, not on the current troymedicalcenter.com site. The filename on the server suggests it's from February 2015.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) does not appear to have any medical records release form or HIM page
- The Patient Information page on the current site returned a 502 Bad Gateway error
- The form was only available on the legacy FastHealth-hosted site (trmc.fasthealth.com), suggesting the hospital migrated to a new website but didn't carry over all patient-facing resources
- The form itself is an image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields

## Summary
Only one ROI form was found, hosted on the hospital's old website (trmc.fasthealth.com). The current website (troymedicalcenter.com) has no medical records page or downloadable authorization form. The form is a low-quality image-only scan from 2015 with no text layer or fillable fields.
