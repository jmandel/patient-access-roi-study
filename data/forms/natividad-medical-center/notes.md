# Natividad Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Natividad Medical Center
- **Location**: Salinas, CA
- **Website**: https://www.natividad.com
- **Type**: Community hospital, independent, government-owned

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF forms**: Searched for `"Natividad Medical Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — initial search was not productive.
2. **Web search for medical records release form**: Searched for `"Natividad Medical Center" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — found both PDF forms directly.
3. **Site-specific search**: Searched `site:natividad.com authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records page at https://www.natividad.com/medical-records/ and both PDF links.

**What worked**: The second web search immediately surfaced both PDF download URLs from the Natividad website.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.natividad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Auth-to-Release-Health-Info_English.pdf
- **File size**: 53,245 bytes
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Authorization to Release Health Information (English). This is an image-only scan (grayscale CCITT-compressed, 1704×2200 pixels at 200 DPI). Created with Calibre in 2019. No text layer — pdftotext produces no output. No fillable fields. Appears to be a newer version of the ROI form but stored as a scanned image.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.natividad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Auth_ROI_e.pdf
- **File size**: 26,523 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Description**: "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" — Natividad Medical Center. This is a text-based PDF (created from Microsoft Word via Acrobat Distiller in 2007). Has full text layer but no fillable form fields. Covers standard ROI elements: patient info, recipient info, scope of records, special categories (mental health, HIV, substance abuse), purpose, expiration, patient rights, and revocation. The form is encrypted (copy-protected but printable).

## Difficulties
- Form-1 is an image-only scan with no text layer, making it less accessible.
- Form-2 is copy-protected (encrypted with RC4, copy disabled).
- Neither form has fillable fields — both must be printed and filled by hand.
- The forms appear to be two different versions/generations of the same authorization form, both still hosted on the website.
- No Spanish version was found as a direct PDF link, though the Spanish medical records page exists.
