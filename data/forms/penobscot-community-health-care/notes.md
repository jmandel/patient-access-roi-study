# Penobscot Community Health Care — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC)
- **Website**: https://pchc.com
- **Location**: Bangor, ME
- **Type**: FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF**: `"Penobscot Community Health Care" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — Successfully found the direct PDF URL on the first try.
2. **Web search site-scoped**: `site:pchc.com authorization release medical records` — Confirmed the same form and also found a Privacy Practices Booklet.
3. **Website navigation**: Visited https://pchc.com/healthinformation/ (Health Information Management page). This page does **not** directly link to the ROI form PDF. Instead, it directs patients to use Datavant (a third-party records management service) for web-based medical record requests. The page links to a Privacy Practices Booklet and a Specialty Referrals Worksheet, but not the authorization form itself.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://pchc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Release-of-Information-2023.pdf
- **File size**: 150,278 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: ROI / Authorization to Disclose Health Information form
- **Fillable fields**: None (flat PDF, Form: none)
- **PDF version**: 1.6
- **Created**: Sep 25, 2023; Modified: Mar 27, 2024
- **Notes**: This is PCHC's "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" form (Rev. 06/01/2023, MRC001). It covers both disclosure TO and obtaining FROM third parties. Includes sections for sensitive health information (mental health, substance use disorder under 42 CFR Part 2, HIV/AIDS). Offers delivery by mail (on CD), fax, email (via secure portal), or verbal communication. Authorization expires 30 months from signature. Not a fillable PDF — designed for print-and-sign.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://pchc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/release-of-information-2023.pdf
- **File size**: 150,296 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Same ROI form as form-1.pdf (identical text content)
- **Notes**: This is the same form hosted at a different URL path. The text content is identical to form-1.pdf, but the files have different MD5 checksums and different modification dates (this one was last modified Sep 25, 2023 vs. Mar 27, 2024 for form-1.pdf). Likely the original upload location before being re-uploaded to a newer path.

## Difficulties
- The ROI form is **not directly linked** from the Health Information Management page (https://pchc.com/healthinformation/). Patients visiting that page are directed to use Datavant's web portal for records requests instead. The PDF form exists on the server but finding it requires knowing the URL or using a search engine.
- No fillable form fields — patients must print, fill by hand, and submit.

## Additional Observations
- PCHC uses **Datavant** (https://www.swellbox.com/pchc-wizard.html) as their third-party information management service for processing medical records requests.
- The HIM page also links to a Privacy Practices Booklet (2025 version) at https://pchc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Privacy_Practices_Booklet_01_01_2025.pdf
- The form is well-structured with clear sections for patient info, recipient info, delivery method, record types, sensitive information, purpose, and duration.
