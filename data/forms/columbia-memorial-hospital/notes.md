## Organization
- **Name:** Columbia Memorial Hospital
- **Location:** Astoria, OR
- **Website:** https://www.columbiamemorial.org
- **Type:** Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Columbia Memorial Hospital" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return a direct PDF link but pointed to the hospital website.
2. **Web search** for `"Columbia Memorial Hospital" Astoria OR "medical records" "release form"` — returned references to the Medical Records page at columbiamemorial.org.
3. **Website navigation** — fetched the Medical Records page at `https://www.columbiamemorial.org/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/`, which contained direct download links to the ROI form in both English and Spanish.

The **website navigation** strategy was the most effective. The form was clearly linked from the Medical Records page under "Requesting copies of your medical record."
