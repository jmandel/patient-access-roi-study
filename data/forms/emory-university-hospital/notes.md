# Emory University Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Emory University Hospital
- **Website**: https://www.emoryhealthcare.org
- **Location**: Atlanta, GA
- **Type**: Teaching hospital, major system, nonprofit
- **Parent System**: Emory Healthcare

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Emory University Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not directly surface the form, but pointed to the medical records page.
2. **Web search** for `Emory Healthcare medical records release form authorization PDF` — found direct PDF URLs including the current fillable English form and an older ROI form.
3. **Web search** for `site:emoryhealthcare.org medical records release authorization` — confirmed the medical records page URL and found additional details about the process.
4. **Direct navigation** to https://www.emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records — found the official medical records page with links to English and Spanish authorization forms, Patient Fee Sheets, e-delivery instructions, and an amendment form.

## What Worked
The web search for "Emory Healthcare medical records release form authorization PDF" was most effective, directly surfacing the PDF URLs. The medical records page at emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records is well-organized and clearly links to all relevant forms.

## Difficulties
- Minor: The current English ROI form (revised 11-2025) references "Emory Hospital Warner Robins – Clinic" and "Emory Hospital Perry – Clinic" prominently in the text extraction, suggesting it's a unified form covering all Emory Healthcare facilities including recently acquired ones.
- The form-1.pdf text extraction via pdftotext shows somewhat limited content because much of the form is in fillable fields; the actual form has more structure than the plain text extraction reveals.
