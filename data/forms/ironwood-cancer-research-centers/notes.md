## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Ironwood Cancer Research Centers" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — initial search did not return direct links.
2. **Web search** for `"Ironwood Cancer Research Centers" "medical records" "release form" PDF` — found direct link to fillable medical records request form on ironwoodcrc.com.
3. **Web search** for `site:ironwoodcrc.com authorization release medical records` — found both the fillable request form and an older authorization to release form (2019).
4. **Web search** for `site:ironwoodcrc.com filetype:pdf medical records` — confirmed the two forms above and also found a new patient forms packet on ironwoodwomenscenters.com (related site).
5. **Browsed** https://www.ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/ — page exists but had no direct PDF links visible in the fetched content.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ironwoodcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Medical-Records-RequestForm-to-request-from-other-facilities_FILLABLE.pdf
- **File size:** 435,431 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information TO Ironwood" — This is a fillable PDF form for patients to authorize OTHER facilities to send records TO Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers (i.e., incoming records for continuing care). Lists all Ironwood physicians. It's an incoming records request form rather than a patient-access ROI form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ironwoodcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Authorization-to-release-protected-health-information.pdf
- **File size:** 156,959 bytes
- **Description:** "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — This is the main ROI form authorizing Ironwood Physicians, PC to release a patient's protected health information. Includes fields for patient info, recipient info, requested information types (physician's notes, lab reports, radiology reports, biopsy reports, prescriptions, radiology imaging), date range, purpose (personal use, continued care, legal, insurance, disability), and method of delivery (fax, secure email, mail, pick up, patient portal). Has text layer.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://www.ironwoodwomenscenters.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/New-Patient-Forms.pdf
- **File size:** 2,375,931 bytes
- **Description:** New patient forms packet (multi-page). Includes patient demographics, patient history, medication/allergy list, "Consent to Release Protected Health Information Contact List" (HIPAA contact list — authorizes Ironwood to share info with specific named individuals involved in care), financial policy/assignment of benefits, and other onboarding forms. The consent form within is a HIPAA contact list, not a traditional ROI form.

## Difficulties
- The patient forms page (https://www.ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/) did not have visible links to downloadable forms when fetched — may require JavaScript rendering or the forms were removed.
- The new patient forms packet was hosted on ironwoodwomenscenters.com (a related/sister site) rather than the main ironwoodcrc.com domain.
- No difficulties with downloading — all URLs returned valid PDFs without bot blocking.

## Summary
Found the primary ROI form (form-2.pdf) which is a straightforward authorization to release protected health information with multiple delivery method options including patient portal and secure email. Form-1 is the reverse direction (requesting records from other facilities into Ironwood). Form-3 is a new patient packet containing a HIPAA contact list consent form.
