# Prevea Health — form-1.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a single-page **Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information** form (form number PRV_839, rev. 0118). It is a general-purpose ROI form covering both patient self-requests and third-party disclosures. It is the only English-language authorization form found for Prevea Health; translations in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish were also available but are substantively the same document. No separate patient-access-specific form was identified.

The form references "HSHS" (Hospital Sisters Health System) in the email disclaimer section, indicating an affiliation or shared form template with that health system, despite Prevea Health being categorized as an independent physician practice.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Excellent.** The form was located immediately via a site-scoped web search (`site:prevea.com`) and is also directly linked from the website's Patient Forms and Documents > Medical Records page (https://www.prevea.com/patients-and-caregivers/patient-forms-and-documents/medical-records). No login, bot blocking, or CAPTCHA was encountered. The URL is descriptive (`Medical-Release-Form-English.pdf`). The retrieval notes describe the process as having "no difficulties."

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (5,341 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero interactive form fields (`fillable_field_count: 0`). The form must be printed and hand-filled or annotated in a PDF viewer — it is not a true fillable PDF.
- **File size:** 334 KB for a single page, somewhat large relative to content (likely due to 2 embedded images, presumably a logo and/or graphic).
- **Fonts:** 10 fonts embedded — more than typical for a single page, suggesting a moderately complex layout.
- **Digital-first design:** No. This is a digitally-created PDF (not a scan), but the lack of fillable fields means it is designed for print-and-fill workflow. There is no mention of online submission options.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure:** The form is logically organized into 9 numbered sections:
1. Patient Information (name, address, DOB, phone, previous names)
2. Authorizes (source provider)
3. To Disclose To (recipient, with delivery options)
4. Date range of information
5. Information to be disclosed (checkboxes for record types)
6. Expiration
7. Purpose
8. Patient rights
9. Signature

**Length:** Single page, which is efficient for the amount of content covered. However, fitting this much content onto one page results in dense text, particularly in section 8.

**Clarity:** Mixed. Sections 1-7 use relatively clear, structured formatting with checkboxes and labeled fields. Section 8 ("YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AUTHORIZATION") is a single dense paragraph of legalese running approximately 200 words with complex nested clauses such as: *"I may revoke this Authorization at any time by notifying the authorizing provider's health information department, as listed above, in writing and will not be effective as to uses and/or disclosures already made in reliance upon this Authorization, needed for an insurer to contest a claim/policy as authorized by law if signing the Authorization was a condition to obtaining insurance coverage, or to submit a claim to third party payers as provided in this Authorization after having provided treatment in reliance upon this Authorization."* This sentence is effectively unparseable for a typical patient.

**Checkbox content in Section 5** is reasonably granular, offering: Abstract of record/Pertinent records, History & physical, Emergency Department report, Consultation reports, Radiology/Imaging reports, Laboratory/Pathology, Radiology/Imaging films/CD, Progress notes, Discharge summary, Operative reports, EKG, and Billing records — plus a free-text field for specific records.

**Restriction options:** Section 5 also includes opt-out checkboxes: *"I DO NOT WANT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DISCLOSED: Alcohol/Drug Abuse, HIV Test Results, Mental Health/Developmental Disabilities"* — allowing patients to restrict sensitive categories, which reflects Wisconsin and federal 42 CFR Part 2 requirements.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Self-request support:** Section 3 explicitly includes a "Self" checkbox under "TO DISCLOSE TO," which is a positive signal that the form is intended for patient access, not only third-party releases. It is not, however, a *dedicated* patient-access form.

**Delivery options:** Notably robust. The form offers five delivery methods: Pick up, Mail to address above, View on-site, Electronic Format, and E-mail. The email option further distinguishes between encrypted and unencrypted email, with a risk acknowledgment for unencrypted delivery. This is above-average for ROI forms.

**Date range defaults:** Section 4 states *"If left blank, only information from the past two (2) years will be disclosed."* This is a restrictive default — patients who want a complete record must affirmatively specify a date range. The form also states *"Future dates will not be honored,"* which is appropriate but limits ongoing authorization.

**Purpose options (Section 7):** Includes "Patient Request" as a checkbox option alongside Continuing Care, Legal Investigation/Action, Insurance Eligibility/Benefits, and Other. The note "copy fees may apply" is included parenthetically.

**Rights disclosure (Section 8):** The form does reference patient rights — right to inspect/receive a copy, right to revoke, no obligation to sign, non-conditioning of treatment on signing. However, it does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 by name, and there is no mention of electronic health information (EHI) export or bulk data access under the 21st Century Cures Act.

**Expiration:** Section 6 states the authorization is *"good until the following date/event"* and defaults to 1 year if left blank. One year is a standard and reasonable default.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee mention:** The form notes *"copy fees may apply"* under Purpose but does not disclose specific fee amounts. This is neutral — not a barrier, but not fully transparent.

**No notarization required.** The form requires only patient signature (or legal representative signature) and, for AODA/Mental Health disclosures, a witness signature — consistent with legal requirements.

**Submission method:** The form does not specify how to submit (mail, fax, in-person). No in-person-only restriction is stated, but no fax number or mailing address for submission is provided on the form itself — only the authorizing provider's fax is requested in Section 2.

**Photo ID requirement:** The form states for pickup: *"to pick up my records. (Photo ID required.)"* This is reasonable for in-person pickup.

**Legal representative provisions:** The form includes provisions for minors, legally incompetent/incapacitated persons, and deceased patients, with appropriate legal authority checkboxes (parent, legal guardian, activated POA for Health Care, next of kin/executor). The parental declaration *"I hereby declare that I have not been denied physical placement of this child"* reflects Wisconsin-specific custody law.

**42 CFR Part 2 / AODA:** The form includes a specific statement about federal regulation: *"Federal Regulation (42 CRF, Part 2)/AODA prohibits any further disclosure without specific written consent of the person to whom it pertains."* Note the typo: "CRF" should be "CFR."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Restrictive date range default:** The form defaults to only the past 2 years if the date range is left blank (*"If left blank, only information from the past two (2) years will be disclosed"*). Patients requesting their complete medical record must know to fill in a date range spanning their entire care history — an unintuitive requirement that effectively limits access for patients who don't read the fine print.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **HSHS references in a Prevea Health form:** The email disclaimer refers to "HSHS" three times (*"HSHS will automatically send e-mail through encrypted/secured means..."*, *"HSHS is not responsible for unauthorized access..."*) without explaining that Prevea Health is affiliated with Hospital Sisters Health System. A patient filling out a Prevea Health form may be confused by references to an apparently unrelated entity.
- **Submission instructions absent:** The form does not indicate where or how to submit the completed authorization — no mailing address, no fax number for returns, no email address for the HIM department. A patient downloading this form has no guidance on the next step after filling it out.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **CFR typo:** Section 8 cites *"42 CRF, Part 2"* — should be "42 CFR, Part 2" (Code of Federal Regulations).
- **Email typo:** Section 3 contains *"e-email"* (doubled prefix) in the sentence *"If the e-email address is shared with another person..."*

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Multilingual availability:** The same authorization form is available in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — reflecting the linguistic demographics of Green Bay, WI and representing a meaningful investment in accessibility that is rare among physician practices.
- **Comprehensive delivery options:** Offering five delivery methods including electronic format and email (with encrypted/unencrypted distinction) is well above average and demonstrates genuine consideration for patient convenience.
- **Explicit self-request pathway:** Including "Self" as a named option in the disclosure recipient section, with associated delivery options, makes it clear that patients can use this form for their own records — unlike many forms that frame everything as third-party disclosure.
