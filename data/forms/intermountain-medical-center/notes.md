# Intermountain Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: Intermountain Medical Center
- **Location**: Murray, UT
- **Parent System**: Intermountain Health (formerly Intermountain Healthcare)
- **Website**: https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/intermountain-medical-center

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "Intermountain Medical Center authorization release health information filetype:pdf"** — Found references to Intermountain Health's authorization forms and their Notice of Privacy Practices.
2. **Web search for "Intermountain Healthcare medical records release form authorization PDF"** — Found direct download links to two forms on intermountainhealthcare.org.
3. **Web search for "site:intermountainhealthcare.org authorization release medical records"** — Found the medical records request pages for Utah/Idaho and other states, plus links to three distinct forms.

All forms were found through the parent system (Intermountain Health) website. Intermountain Medical Center does not have its own separate ROI form — it uses system-wide forms. The forms were directly downloadable as PDFs without any login or portal requirement.

## Difficulties Encountered
- **None significant**. Forms were easy to find via web search and directly downloadable. No bot blocking, no login walls, no JavaScript-rendered pages.
- The organization uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones, which is typical for large health systems.
- There are two distinct domains: `intermountainhealthcare.org` (legacy) and `prod.intermountainhealth.org` (current), both hosting forms.

## Summary
Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) uses Intermountain Health's system-wide ROI forms. Three forms were found and downloaded: one legacy general authorization form, one newer third-party disclosure form, and one patient self-request form. All are real PDFs with text layers and appear to have fillable fields (forms 2 and 3 are clearly fillable with Print/Clear buttons). Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.
