# WellSpan York Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for "WellSpan York Hospital authorization release health information form PDF"** — Immediately returned a direct link to the main WellSpan ROI form hosted on wellspan.org.
2. **Web search for "WellSpan medical records release form PDF"** — Confirmed the same form and also surfaced a second form used by WellSpan's neighborhood hospitals.
3. **Web search for "site:wellspan.org authorization release medical records"** — Confirmed both forms and provided context about the Medical Records and Patient Forms pages.

WellSpan York Hospital is part of the WellSpan Health system, so forms are published at the system level on wellspan.org rather than on a hospital-specific site.
