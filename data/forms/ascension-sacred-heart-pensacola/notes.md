# Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for specific facility + ROI keywords**: Searched `Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form PDF`. This immediately returned the facility-specific authorization form PDF hosted on healthcare.ascension.org.

2. **Web search for parent system (Ascension) ROI forms**: Searched `Ascension health system "release of information" "authorization form" medical records request PDF`. Found that Ascension uses market/state-specific ROI forms — each region has its own version. The Florida/Pensacola form was already found in strategy 1.

3. **Navigated the facility's medical records page**: Visited the Ascension Sacred Heart patient portal and medical records page (`healthcare.ascension.org/locations/florida/flpen/sfch/patient-and-family-resources/patient-portal-and-medical-records`). The page directs patients to a Swellbox-powered online records request wizard but also references downloadable forms. It also mentions patients can use the patient portal to access most records directly.

- **Document type**: Medical Records Release Form — Department of Radiation Oncology specific
- **Initial impression**: Single-page records release form specific to the Sacred Heart Cancer Center / Department of Radiation Oncology. This form is for requesting records *from* another provider *to* Sacred Heart (records flow inbound to their Radiation Oncology department at 1545 Airport Blvd, Suite 1000, Pensacola FL 32504). Includes similar fields to form-1 but is department-specific and oriented toward incoming records rather than patient self-request.

## Difficulties Encountered

- **None significant**. The main ROI form was easily discoverable via web search and directly downloadable as a PDF without any bot blocking or JavaScript rendering requirements.
- The facility's medical records page primarily directs patients to a Swellbox online wizard for records requests, but the traditional PDF form is also available via direct URL on the Ascension content delivery system.
- Ascension is a large national system with market-specific forms. The Florida/Pensacola form (form-1.pdf) is the correct one for this facility.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy

The form was found on the first web search and downloaded without issues.
