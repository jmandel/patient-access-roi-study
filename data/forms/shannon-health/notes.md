# Shannon Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Shannon Health
- **Location:** San Angelo, TX
- **Website:** https://www.shannonhealth.com
- **Type:** Community hospital, regional system, nonprofit

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for `Shannon Health San Angelo TX "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — returned results pointing to the medical records page and suggested PDF URLs.
2. The initially suggested PDF URLs (`/documents/medical-record-authorization.pdf`) returned **404 errors** — the filenames had been updated for 2025.
3. **Navigated the website** via Chrome DevTools to `https://www.shannonhealth.com/patients-visitors/request-medical-records/` — found the correct, current download links.
4. The page clearly links to both English and Spanish versions of the ROI form, labeled "Medical Record Authorization Form."

## Difficulties
- The PDF URLs returned by the web search were outdated (returned 404). The filenames had been updated from `medical-record-authorization.pdf` to `ROI-Form-2025-English.pdf` / `ROI-Form-2025-Spanish.pdf`. Navigating the actual website page resolved this.

## Findability Assessment
- The form is easy to find: **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** (2 clicks from homepage). The page clearly explains the process and links directly to downloadable PDFs. Both English and Spanish versions are provided. Submission options include email and mail.
