# Shannon Health — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Spanish-language Authorization for Release of Information** form, titled "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA LA DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN." It is the direct Spanish translation of form-1.pdf (the English-language ROI form). Both forms share identical structure, field layout, and revision date ("Fecha de revisión: 06/2024"). The file was downloaded from `https://www.shannonhealth.com/documents/ROI-Form-2025-Spanish.pdf`. The two documents together constitute Shannon Health's complete ROI form offering — one English, one Spanish — rather than two functionally different forms.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form is **easy to locate**. Per the retrieval notes, the path is **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** (2 clicks from the homepage). The medical records page links directly to both the English and Spanish PDF downloads, clearly labeled. The URL path (`/documents/ROI-Form-2025-Spanish.pdf`) is descriptive and includes the language and year.

One complication: earlier web search results returned outdated URLs (`/documents/medical-record-authorization.pdf`) that produced 404 errors. The filenames were updated for 2025. This means anyone following a cached or bookmarked link would encounter a broken URL, though the website itself currently links to the correct files.

The page also explains submission options (email and mail), which adds context around the form download.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The full extracted text is 5,479 characters across 2 pages — this is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero** (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being a digitally-produced PDF (not a scan), the form has no interactive form fields. Patients must print and hand-write all entries.
- **Fonts**: 2 fonts embedded.
- **Images**: 2 embedded images (likely the Shannon Health logo or similar branding).
- **File size**: 115,960 bytes (~113 KB) for 2 pages — reasonable.
- **PDF design**: This is a digitally-authored document (not a scan), but it was designed as a **print-first** artifact. Blank lines like `_____________________________________________________________` for patient name and `________________` for date of birth confirm it is intended for handwritten completion. No checkboxes are interactive — they appear as text-rendered labels ("Papel", "CD", "My Chart", etc.) without form field widgets.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages, which is appropriate for a general ROI authorization.

**Structure and organization**: The form follows a logical flow:
1. Patient identification (name, DOB, phone, email, address)
2. Recipient identification (person/organization, address, contact, relationship)
3. Purpose of release (8 checkbox options: "Atención médica continua," "Fines legales," "Uso militar," "Uso personal," "Discapacidad del Seguro Social," "Escuela," "Seguro," "Próxima cita")
4. Scope: date range, facility type (Hospital/Clínica), substance use disorder records handling
5. Specific record types (~15 checkboxes including "Visitas al consultorio médico," "Resultados de laboratorio," "Imágenes de radiología," "Registro completo," etc.)
6. Format selection (Paper, CD, My Chart, Pick Up, Mail, encrypted email)
7. Legal disclosures (expiration, revocation, re-disclosure, fees)
8. Signature block
9. Submission instructions

**Clarity**: The language is formal but largely comprehensible Spanish. However, it is a **direct translation** of legal/medical English, which results in some awkward or dense phrasing. For example: "Autorizo la divulgación de la siguiente información, incluidos todos los antecedentes que incluyan cualquier trastorno por consumo de sustancias y/o antecedentes de tratamiento de trastornos por consumo de sustancias" — this is a long, nested sentence that would challenge many readers.

**Layout**: Without interactive fields, the visual hierarchy relies on bold text, underlines, and whitespace. The section for record types appears as a flat list of checkbox labels without strong visual grouping. The legal disclosures on page 2 are dense paragraph text.

**Translation quality**: Some labels are translated inconsistently. The "FORMAT REQUESTED" section lists "My Chart" (untranslated English), "Recolección" (for "Pick Up"), and "Correo" (for "Mail"), while also using the English-derived "ShareFile" in the email option. The contact email address `ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org` is given in English (the abbreviation "ROI" is not explained in Spanish). Some field labels show minor issues — e.g., "vacunas" (vaccines/shot record) and "Registros de" and "Informes de" appear to be truncated or incomplete in the extracted text, possibly reflecting layout issues where text wraps across columns in the PDF.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form serves both purposes. The first recipient option is "Usted" (Self), which allows patients to request their own records. However, the form is primarily structured as a third-party release authorization — the "Usted" option is just one checkbox among the recipient fields. There is no separate, simplified pathway for patients requesting their own records.

**Scope options**: Good. Patients can specify:
- Date ranges ("Fechas de tratamiento (rango de fechas) desde: ___ hasta ___")
- Facility type (Hospital or Clínica)
- ~15 specific record types, or "Registro completo" (Entire Record)
- Substance use disorder records inclusion/exclusion (with explicit opt-in/opt-out)

**Format options**: The form offers 6 format options: Paper, CD, My Chart, Pick Up ("Recolección"), Mail ("Correo"), and encrypted email via ShareFile. The encrypted email option is notable and patient-friendly.

**Right of Access language**: The form states "Puedo ver o recibir una copia de la información médica protegida que se utilizará o divulgará" and includes a statement that Shannon "no puede condicionar el tratamiento, el pago, la inscripción ni la elegibilidad para los beneficios (incluida la asistencia financiera) al hecho de que yo firme esta autorización." This language references HIPAA non-conditioning requirements (§ 164.508(b)(4)) but does not explicitly cite HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or use the term "Right of Access."

**EHI Export awareness**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or USCDI.

**Language accessibility**: The existence of this Spanish-language form is itself a significant patient-centeredness feature. San Angelo, TX has a substantial Spanish-speaking population, and providing a fully translated ROI form reduces barriers for LEP (Limited English Proficiency) patients.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fees**: The form states "Entiendo que puede cobrarse una tarifa por la copia de la información solicitada. Se me notificado de esta política y acepto pagar según corresponda." This acknowledges potential fees without specifying amounts. The phrasing "acepto pagar según corresponda" (I agree to pay accordingly) is a blanket fee acceptance — patients sign without knowing the cost.

**Expiration**: "Esta autorización vencerá un año después de la fecha de la firma" — one year from signature. This is a standard, reasonable expiration period.

**Revocation**: Clearly described — patients can revoke "en cualquier momento enviando notificación por escrito" (at any time by written notice). The limitation that revocation doesn't apply retroactively is properly stated.

**Re-disclosure warning**: Present and appropriate.

**Non-conditioning statement**: Included — Shannon cannot condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on signing the authorization.

**Submission methods**: Three options provided — email (ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org, listed as "Método preferido"), mailing address (120 E. Harris Avenue), and physical address (3555 Knickerbocker Road). No in-person-only requirement.

**Sensitive information**: The form explicitly addresses substance use disorder records (with separate opt-in/opt-out) and warns that disclosed information "puede incluir, entre otros, antecedentes, diagnósticos y/o tratamientos de abuso de drogas o alcohol, enfermedades mentales o enfermedades transmisibles, incluido el virus de inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH) y el síndrome de inmunodeficiencia adquirida (SIDA)."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish-language form available**: Shannon Health is one of few community hospitals to offer a fully translated Spanish ROI form, linked directly alongside the English version on the medical records page. This serves the significant Spanish-speaking population in the San Angelo, TX area.
- **Email submission as preferred method**: The form explicitly labels email (`ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org`) as the "Método preferido" (Preferred Method), reducing barriers for remote submission. Many organizations require mail or in-person delivery only.
- **Encrypted email delivery option**: Offering "Correo electrónico (cifrado mediante de ShareFile)" as a delivery format shows awareness of secure electronic delivery, which is uncommon for community hospitals.
- **Substance use disorder records handling**: The form provides explicit opt-in/opt-out for substance use disorder records, giving patients granular control over this sensitive category — a 42 CFR Part 2 best practice.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Fee disclosure is vague**: The form says fees "may" be charged and the patient agrees to "pay accordingly," but no fee schedule or estimate is provided. A patient signing this form has no idea whether copying costs will be $5 or $500. Under HIPAA, fees for patient access requests are limited to reasonable, cost-based amounts, but the form does not distinguish between patient-access and third-party fees.
- **Truncated record type labels**: Several record type labels in the extracted text appear incomplete — "Registro de" and "Informes de" seem to be cut off, suggesting either a PDF layout issue where column-wrapped text doesn't extract cleanly, or actual label truncation in the form design. This could confuse patients trying to select specific record types.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Minor grammatical error**: "Se me notificado de esta política" should read "Se me **ha** notificado de esta política" (missing auxiliary verb). This is a translation defect in the fee disclosure paragraph.
- **No fillable fields**: Despite being a digitally-authored PDF with a clear layout, zero interactive form fields were implemented. This is a missed opportunity — the digital-first design could easily support fillable checkboxes and text fields, which would make the form far more accessible and reduce processing errors from illegible handwriting.
- **Outdated cached URLs**: The retrieval notes document that earlier PDF URLs returned 404 errors after a filename change. While the current website links correctly, stale search engine results or bookmarks will lead patients to dead links.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Blanket fee acceptance before cost disclosure**: Requiring patients to agree to "pagar según corresponda" (pay accordingly) as part of the authorization signature — without disclosing what fees will be charged — could discourage patients from requesting their records. For patient access requests under HIPAA § 164.524, fees are capped at reasonable cost-based amounts, but the form's language does not acknowledge this limit or differentiate between patient access and third-party release fee structures.
