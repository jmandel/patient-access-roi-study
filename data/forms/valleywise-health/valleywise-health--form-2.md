## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **dedicated patient access form** (Form #45643, Rev. 02/2023) — specifically designed for patients requesting their own protected health information under HIPAA's Right of Access. It is a 2-page bilingual PDF: page 1 is English, page 2 is an identical Spanish translation.

Valleywise Health maintains a two-form system:
- **Form 43439** (form-1.pdf): General "Authorization to Use or Disclose PHI" — a third-party release form with numbered sections (1.0–8.0), purpose/reason fields, patient rights language, and an expiration clause.
- **Form 45643** (form-2.pdf, this document): Patient-specific access request — simpler, with no purpose/reason field, no expiration clause, and no patient rights section beyond the processing timeline.

The existence of a separate patient access form is notable — it signals that Valleywise Health distinguishes between patient access (§ 164.524) and third-party disclosure (§ 164.508), which many organizations fail to do.

The form cross-references Form 43439 for sensitive information categories: "for information related to AIDS/HIV, Communicable Diseases, Behavioral Health, Alcohol/Drug Abuse or Genetic Testing a separate Authorization is required, see Valleywise Health form 43439." Notably, the Spanish version references "document 43780" instead of 43439, which appears to be an error (see Notable Observations).

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found through a web search for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`, which returned direct PDF URLs. A site-scoped search also located the patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` which links to the forms.

The URL is descriptive and human-readable: `Form-45643-Patient-Request-For-Access-To-Protected-Health-Information_ENG_SPA.pdf`. The filename clearly identifies the form number, purpose, and that it includes both English and Spanish versions.

The forms were publicly accessible without authentication, bot-blocking, or CAPTCHA. No significant difficulties were encountered during retrieval.

**Assessment**: Good findability. The form is publicly hosted, the URL is descriptive, and it is discoverable both via web search and through the organization's website navigation. The `_ENG_SPA` filename suffix is a useful indicator of bilingual content.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (7,172 characters across 2 pages). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero** interactive form fields (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being a digitally-authored document (not a scan), it has no interactive PDF form fields. Patients must print and fill by hand or use a PDF annotation tool.
- **File size**: 155,916 bytes (~152 KB) for 2 pages — reasonable.
- **Font count**: 8 fonts used.
- **Embedded images**: 4 (likely logos/headers for both language versions).
- **Digital-first design**: The form was clearly created digitally (clean text layer, structured layout), but it was designed as a print-first document. The lack of any fillable fields is a significant missed opportunity — this is a form that could easily support interactive completion.

**Assessment**: The document has good text extraction quality but falls short on interactivity. A form with zero fillable fields in 2024/2025 is a barrier to digital completion. The contact information (email: ROI@valleywisehealth.org, phone, fax) is prominently displayed, but there is no indication of electronic submission capability — the form appears to require printing, signing, and mailing/faxing.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — one English, one Spanish. The length is appropriate; each language version fits on a single page.

**Structure and organization**: The form follows a logical flow:
1. Header with HIM department contact details
2. Patient identification fields (name, DOB, phone, SSN, MRN, address)
3. Record type selection (checkbox grid)
4. Date range specification
5. Delivery format selection
6. Recipient/mailing information
7. Email encryption notice
8. Processing information (fees, timeline)
9. Signature and date

**Clarity**: The language is mostly plain and direct. Instructions are clear: "Please check (✔) the appropriate box(es) (❑) and fill in the blank(s) as needed." The processing section uses accessible language: "We appreciate your patience while we process your request."

**Record type granularity**: The form offers a detailed selection of record types across three columns:
- Column 1: All Records, Abstract of record, Discharge Summary, Face Sheet
- Column 2: History & Physical, Images, Laboratory Reports, Medication Records, Nursing Assessments/Notes, Pathology Reports, Progress Notes (specify)
- Column 3: Operative Report, Operative Notes, Other Procedure Report, Radiology Reports, Itemized Billing Statement, Other (specify)

This is a notably comprehensive list with 16+ specific record types plus an "Other" catch-all.

**Layout**: The form uses checkboxes and blank lines effectively. The three-column layout for record types is space-efficient. However, with zero fillable fields, the visual design assumes print completion.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access focus**: This form is explicitly designed for patient access — the title is "Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information," not a general disclosure authorization. This is a significant patient-centered design choice.

**Scope options**: Excellent. Patients can select from 16+ specific record types or request "All Records." Date ranges can be specified as either specific dates or "All Date(s) of Treatment."

**Format/delivery options**: Multiple formats offered:
- Valleywise Health Patient Portal (MyChart)
- Paper Copy
- Electronic Copy: CD, USB, E-Mail
- Fax

The MyChart portal option is a modern touch. The email option includes a thoughtful encryption notice: "Email is not a secure means of communication. We will encrypt email communications containing your records unless you tell us you prefer Valleywise Health to use unencrypted email." Patients can initial to opt for unencrypted email, with a caveat about file size limitations.

**Sensitive information handling**: The form notes that AIDS/HIV, communicable diseases, behavioral health, substance abuse, and genetic testing records require a separate authorization (Form 43439). This is appropriate given state and federal restrictions on these categories, though it does create additional burden for patients seeking complete records.

**Missing elements**:
- No explicit reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access by citation.
- No mention of electronic health information (EHI) export or bulk data options.
- No explanation of patient rights (unlike the companion form 43439, which has a detailed Section 8.0 on patient rights).
- The form requests SSN, which is unusual and potentially concerning for a patient access request.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fees**: The form states: "Valleywise Health may charge a fee for the copying of requested health information plus postage for mailing the copies to you. If you would like a copy of your record to be provided on portable media such as a CD or USB drive, we may charge you the actual cost of the portable media." The use of "may charge" is hedging language; no specific fee schedule is provided. The language about "actual cost of the portable media" aligns with HIPAA's cost-based fee limit for patient access requests.

**Timeline**: "Valleywise Health will respond to your request for health information within 30 days of our receipt of your request" with a possible 30-day extension if records are not readily accessible or are off-site. This aligns with HIPAA's 30-day response requirement with one 30-day extension (§ 164.524(b)(2)).

**No notarization or in-person requirement**: The form does not require notarization, witnesses, or in-person submission — a positive compliance signal.

**No expiration clause**: Unlike Form 43439 (which expires 1 year after signature if no date is specified), this patient access request form has no expiration provision. This is appropriate since it is a one-time access request, not an ongoing authorization.

**SSN collection**: The form includes a field for Social Security Number. While this may be used for patient identification, collecting SSN on a form that could be faxed or emailed raises security concerns and is not a HIPAA requirement for patient access requests.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated patient access form**: Valleywise Health maintains a separate form specifically for patient access requests, distinct from the third-party release authorization. This is a best practice that many organizations fail to implement.
- **Full bilingual (English/Spanish) design**: The entire form is duplicated in Spanish on page 2 — not just a translation notice, but a complete parallel form. Given the Phoenix, AZ demographics, this is highly appropriate and well-executed.
- **Granular record type selection**: 16+ specific record types allow patients to request exactly what they need rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice.
- **Email encryption transparency**: The form proactively addresses email security, defaults to encryption, and gives patients an informed choice to opt out — a thoughtful approach to balancing security and convenience.
- **MyChart portal option**: Including the patient portal as a delivery method offers a modern, secure digital pathway.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **SSN field on a patient access form**: The form requests the patient's Social Security Number. SSN is not required for HIPAA Right of Access requests and collecting it on a form that may be transmitted via fax or email creates unnecessary identity theft risk. Medical Record Number and Date of Birth should be sufficient for patient identification.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Fee language is vague**: "Valleywise Health may charge a fee" without any specific amounts, fee schedule reference, or URL. Patients cannot anticipate costs before submitting. The companion form (43439) similarly references "our website" for fee information but this form does not.
- **"Release or Mail To" section on a patient access form**: The form includes fields for "Individual/Legal Guardian/Personal Representative" and "Phone Number of Individual Receiving Records if not Patient." This suggests the form may also be used to send records to someone other than the patient, blurring the line between patient access and third-party release. If this form is truly for patient access only, these fields create confusion about its scope.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Spanish version references wrong form number**: The English version directs patients to "Valleywise Health form 43439" for sensitive information categories, but the Spanish version references "documento 43780 de Valleywise Health" — an apparent typographical error that could send Spanish-speaking patients searching for a nonexistent form.
- **Zero fillable fields**: Despite being a digitally-authored PDF (not a scan), the form has no interactive form fields. This is a technical deficiency rather than a content error, but it means the form cannot be completed digitally without third-party annotation tools.
