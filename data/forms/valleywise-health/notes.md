# Valleywise Health Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `Valleywise Health "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — initial search did not surface direct links.
2. **Web search with "medical records" terms**: Searched for `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — successfully found direct PDF URLs for both the general authorization form and the patient-specific access form.
3. **Site-scoped search**: Searched `site:valleywisehealth.org authorization release medical records` — found the patient records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/` which links to the forms.

**What worked best**: The second web search with "medical records" and "release form" terms returned direct PDF URLs from the Valleywise Health website.

## Difficulties Encountered

- No significant difficulties. Both forms were publicly accessible PDFs hosted on the Valleywise Health WordPress site, downloadable without any bot blocking or authentication.
- The organization maintains two separate forms: one for general third-party disclosure (form-1) and one specifically for patient access (form-2), which is a good practice.
