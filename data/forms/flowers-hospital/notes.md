# Flowers Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Flowers Hospital
- **Location:** Dothan, AL
- **Website:** https://www.flowershospital.com
- **Parent System:** Triad of Alabama LLC (for-profit; part of the CHS/Community Health Systems network based on website template)
- **Type:** Community hospital, 235 beds

## Search Strategy
1. **Web search** for "Flowers Hospital Dothan AL authorization release health information form PDF" — found the hospital's medical records request page and a related Wiregrass Surgical Associates PDF.
2. **Web search** for parent system affiliation — confirmed Triad of Alabama LLC ownership.
3. **Navigated** https://www.flowershospital.com/request-medical-records — found the official medical records request page with links to downloadable English and Spanish authorization forms (HIM-1406).

## What Worked
Direct navigation to the hospital's "Request Medical Records" page (linked from Patients & Visitors section) was the most effective. The page provides both an online request portal (via Swellbox) and downloadable PDF forms.
