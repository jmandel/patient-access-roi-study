# Flowers Hospital — form-1.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**Document:** Wiregrass Surgical Associates Medical Records Release Form
**Source URL:** https://wiregrasssurgical.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-Medical-Records-Release.pdf
**Organization on form:** Wiregrass Surgical Associates, P.C. — not Flowers Hospital itself

This is **not** Flowers Hospital's own ROI form. It is a release form from Wiregrass Surgical Associates, an affiliated surgical practice physically located at "Flowers Hospital Doctor's Center, 4300 West Main Street, Suite 24, Dothan, AL 36305." The form was surfaced during web searches for Flowers Hospital authorization forms due to the geographic and organizational affiliation.

In context, Flowers Hospital has three downloaded documents:
- **form-1.pdf** (this document): Wiregrass Surgical Associates release form — affiliated practice
- **form-2.pdf**: Flowers Hospital's official "Patient Request for Health Information" (HIM-1406, English) — the primary ROI form
- **form-3.pdf**: Same official form in Spanish (HIM-1406S)

Form-1 is a secondary, incidental find. A patient seeking Flowers Hospital records would use form-2 (or form-3); this form applies only to records held by the affiliated surgical group.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was found via a general web search for Flowers Hospital authorization forms. It is hosted on the Wiregrass Surgical Associates website (`wiregrasssurgical.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/`), not on Flowers Hospital's website. The URL path suggests it was uploaded in May 2017 and has not been relocated since.

A patient specifically looking for Flowers Hospital's form would not naturally land here. Conversely, a Wiregrass Surgical patient might find it by navigating that practice's website, though the WordPress uploads path suggests it may not be prominently linked from a patient-facing page. There is no evidence from the retrieval notes that this form appears on the Flowers Hospital medical records page, which instead links to the official HIM-1406 forms.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Format:** 1-page PDF, 109,582 bytes (107 KB)
- **Text layer:** Yes — full text is extractable via pdftotext
- **Fillable fields:** None (0 interactive fields). The form uses underscores and blank lines for handwritten entry (e.g., `"I, _______________________________, DOB _________________"`)
- **Fonts:** 5 embedded fonts
- **Images:** 0 embedded images
- **Scan status:** Not an image-only scan — it is a digitally-created document

The document is a flat, non-interactive PDF. While it has a proper text layer (allowing search and copy), it lacks any fillable form fields. A patient must print, handwrite, and fax or deliver the completed form. The file size is reasonable for a 1-page text document. No PDF version information is available in the metadata, but the document appears to be a straightforward digital creation, not a scanned paper form.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 1 page — appropriate for the scope of the form.

**Structure and layout:** The form is a single block of continuous prose followed by a few fields. It opens with the practice's letterhead (address, phone, fax, URL), then launches directly into a dense paragraph of legal authorization language. There is no visual hierarchy — no section headers, no numbered steps, no clear separation between informational text and data-entry fields. The "Purpose of Release" checkboxes (Medical Care, Legal, Insurance, Other) and the signature/date lines appear at the bottom, but they flow directly from the legal text without visual breaks.

**Clarity:** The language is legalistic and dense. The opening sentence is a 49-word run-on: *"I, _______________________________, DOB _________________, hereby authorize the disclosure of my individually Protected Health Information (PHI) as described herein."* Subsequent sentences cover revocation rights, re-disclosure risks, authorization duration, fee schedule, and liability release — all in a continuous block without paragraph breaks or plain-language summaries.

**Readability concerns:**
- The entire authorization text is presented as a wall of legal prose with no headings or bullets
- Key information (fee schedule, expiration period, revocation rights) is buried within paragraphs rather than called out
- The form misspells HIPAA as "HIPPA": *"This form authorizes release of information in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)."*

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a general release form, not specifically designed for patient access to their own records. The form uses the language *"authorize the disclosure of my individually Protected Health Information"* and asks the patient to specify "Release To" — suggesting a third-party disclosure model. However, the form does state: *"I understand that I have a right to inspect and obtain a copy of any information disclosed."*

**Scope options:** Limited. There is a single free-text line: *"Specific Items or Time of Service Needed: _________________________________________"*. No checkboxes for specific record types (progress notes, lab reports, imaging, etc.), unlike Flowers Hospital's official HIM-1406 form which offers 12+ specific record type checkboxes.

**Delivery options:** Not specified. The form lists fax numbers at the bottom (three numbers: 334-793-6840, 334-673-0794, 334-944-4238), but there is no checkbox or field for how the patient wants to receive their records (paper, electronic, mail, pick-up). The "Fax to Number" notation appears to be for submitting the form itself, not for record delivery.

**Format options:** None offered. No mention of electronic delivery, email, removable media, or patient portal access.

**Right of Access language:** The form states *"I understand that I have a right to inspect and obtain a copy of any information disclosed"* but does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's specific right of access. The HIPAA reference is limited to the misspelled citation noted above.

**Fee disclosure:** The form discloses Alabama state law fees: *"$1.00 for each page up to 25 pages, $0.50 for each page in excess of 25 pages and a search fee of $5.00. Also, reasonable costs shall include the actual mailing costs of mailing the medical records."* This fee schedule applies to third-party requests under Alabama law; HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a "reasonable, cost-based fee" which may differ.

**Sensitive information:** No special handling for sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, genetic testing). The form broadly authorizes release of *"medical records, financial transactions and other patient-related information including examination, diagnosis, treatment, results, operative notes and/or other reports"* without giving the patient granular control over sensitive categories.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration:** *"This authorization will remain in effect for one (1) year or until I revoke it in writing."* A one-year expiration is standard and reasonable.

**Revocation rights:** Clearly stated: *"I may cancel this consent at any time in writing to Wiregrass Surgical Associates, P.C."* with an acknowledgment that prior disclosures remain valid.

**Liability waiver:** The form includes: *"I hereby release Wiregrass Surgical Associates, P.C. and its employees from any and all liability that may arise from the release of information as I have directed."* This is a broad liability release bundled into the authorization, which could discourage patients from filing complaints about improper disclosure.

**Fee structure:** The disclosed per-page fees ($1.00/page for first 25, $0.50/page thereafter, plus $5.00 search fee) follow Alabama Code § 12-21-6.1 for third-party requests. However, if a patient is requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access, the fee must be limited to a reasonable, cost-based fee — which may be lower than this statutory schedule. The form does not distinguish between patient-access requests and third-party requests for fee purposes.

**Treatment conditionality:** The form correctly states: *"I further understand that my ability to obtain treatment will not depend in any way on whether or not I sign this authorization."*

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Broad liability waiver bundled with authorization:** The form requires patients to *"release Wiregrass Surgical Associates, P.C. and its employees from any and all liability that may arise from the release of information"* as part of the same authorization. This broad indemnification is bundled into the consent — patients cannot authorize release without also waiving liability.

- **Fee schedule may exceed HIPAA patient-access limits:** The form quotes Alabama per-page fees ($1.00/page + $0.50/page + $5.00 search fee) without distinguishing between patient-access and third-party requests. For a patient requesting their own records, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts, and a per-page fee model has been explicitly questioned by HHS guidance.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Form's relationship to Flowers Hospital is unclear:** The form is from Wiregrass Surgical Associates, P.C., but the footer references "Flowers Hospital Doctor's Center." A patient could be confused about whether this form can be used to request records from Flowers Hospital itself or only from the surgical practice.

- **"Purpose of Release" categories are vague:** The four options (Medical Care, Legal, Insurance, Other) don't clarify whether the patient is requesting records for themselves vs. authorizing release to a third party.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **HIPAA misspelled as "HIPPA":** The form states *"in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)"* — a factual error in the acronym for the governing federal law. This undermines credibility and suggests the form has not been carefully reviewed.

- **Form appears dated (2017):** The URL path includes `2017/05/`, and there is no visible revision date on the form itself. This is now nearly 9 years old, predating significant HHS guidance on patient access rights (2019 Right of Access Initiative, 2020 information blocking rules).

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Re-disclosure warning included:** The form clearly warns patients that *"Disclosure of this information carries with it the potential for unauthorized re-disclosure and once information is disclosed, it may no longer be protected by federal privacy regulations."* This is a useful and transparent disclosure.

- **Treatment non-conditionality stated:** The form explicitly states treatment will not be conditioned on signing the authorization, as required by HIPAA.
