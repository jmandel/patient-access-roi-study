## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for authorization/release form PDF** — Searched for `Sea Mar Community Health Centers "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`. This immediately returned a direct link to the PDF on seamar.org.
2. **Web search for medical records release form** — Confirmed the same URL.
3. **Site-scoped search** — Searched `site:seamar.org medical records release authorization form` to check for additional forms. Only one ROI form was found.

- **None** — The form was easy to find. The first web search returned the direct PDF URL. The form is publicly accessible with no bot blocking or login walls.

## Additional Notes

- Sea Mar also offers a patient portal (MyChart) at https://www.seamar.org/ohr/index.php for electronic record access.
- The form appears to be a general-purpose ROI form (third-party release), not specifically a patient-access form. It covers both sending records to other providers and patient requests.
- The form references Title 42 for sensitive substance use disorder information.
