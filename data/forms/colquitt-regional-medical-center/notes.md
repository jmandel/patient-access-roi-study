## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Colquitt Regional Medical Center "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — did not return a direct PDF link but pointed to the Health Records page on their website.
2. **Web search** for `site:colquittregional.com medical records release authorization` — successfully identified the page https://colquittregional.com/patients-visitors/health-records-patient-portal/ as the location for the form.
3. **Website navigation** — navigated to the Health Records & Patient Portal page using the browser to find the direct PDF download link, which was embedded as a "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button.

**What worked**: The site-scoped web search quickly identified the correct page. The form link was clearly labeled on the Health Records & Patient Portal page under "Request for Medical Records."

## Difficulties
- The form is an **image-only scan** with essentially no extractable text layer, making it inaccessible to screen readers and not fillable digitally.
- The form was created on April 23, 2021, and appears to be a scan of a paper form rather than a digitally-designed document.
- Finding the form was straightforward — it was 2 clicks deep (Patients & Visitors → Health Records & Patient Portal → Download link).

## Retrieval Difficulty
**Easy** — The form was clearly linked from the Health Records page with a descriptive download button label.
