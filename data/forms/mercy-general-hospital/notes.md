## Search Strategies

1. **Web search**: `Mercy General Hospital Sacramento "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — found direct PDF links for the general authorization form and a medical group patient access form.
2. **Web search**: `Dignity Health "medical records" "release form" authorization PDF` — confirmed the above and found additional forms including a hospital-specific patient access form.
3. **Web search**: `site:dignityhealth.org sacramento "medical record requests" "patient access" form` — found a third form (hospital-level patient access request) at a different URL.

The Dignity Health Sacramento medical records page (https://www.dignityhealth.org/sacramento/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/medical-record-requests) is the main landing page for requesting records from Mercy General Hospital and sibling facilities.

## Failed Downloads

- **URL**: https://www.dignityhealth.org/sacramento/-/media/cm/media/documents/patients-and-visitors/patient-access-request-form.ashx — returned 404 Not Found.

## Difficulties
- The organization has two separate tracks for records: hospital records (Mercy General Hospital) and medical group records (Mercy Medical Group). Each has its own patient access form.
- One URL from search results returned a 404, suggesting some forms have been moved or consolidated.
- Forms are reasonably easy to find — linked from the Dignity Health Sacramento medical records page.
