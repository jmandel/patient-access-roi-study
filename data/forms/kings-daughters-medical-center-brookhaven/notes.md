# King's Daughters Medical Center (Brookhaven, MS) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name**: King's Daughters Medical Center
- **Website**: https://www.kdmc.org
- **Location**: Brookhaven, MS 39601
- **Type**: Independent nonprofit community hospital

## Search Strategies

### 1. Web searches (multiple queries)
- `"King's Daughters Medical Center" Brookhaven MS authorization release health information form PDF`
- `site:kdmc.org authorization release medical records form`
- `"kdmc.org" medical records release form download Brookhaven Mississippi`
- `"King's Daughters Medical Center" Brookhaven "release of information" OR "authorization for release" filetype:pdf`
- `site:kdmc.org filetype:pdf`

**Result**: No ROI/authorization form PDF found. Multiple search engines consistently confirmed that no downloadable release of information form is publicly available on kdmc.org.

### 2. Website navigation
- Navigated to Patients & Visitors section
- Checked "Online Medical Record Request" page → redirects to Datavant/Swellbox online wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/kings-daughters-mc-wizard.html)
- Checked "My Patient Access" page → patient portal login only (myportal.kdmc.org)
- Checked "Notice of Privacy Practices" page → links to the NPP PDF
- Checked Admissions, Billing, Patient Rights pages
- Reviewed full site map at kdmc.org/site-map/
- Scanned all pages for PDF links

**Result**: The website does not link to any downloadable ROI form. Medical records requests are handled entirely through the Datavant/Swellbox online wizard.

### 3. PDF inventory on kdmc.org
Exhaustive search found these PDFs hosted on the domain:
- `KDMC-Joint-Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf` — Notice of Privacy Practices
- `KDMC-Occ-Health-Authorization-Form-Revised.pdf` — Employer/Occupational Health Authorization
- `KDMC-Financial-Assistance-Policy-Plain-Language-Summary.pdf` — Financial assistance
- `KDMC-Financial-Assistance-Policy.pdf` — Full financial assistance policy
- `Kings-Daughters-Medical-Center-2021-CHNA-Report.pdf` — Community Health Needs Assessment
- `KDMC-Prayer-Walk-Book-2025.pdf` — Prayer walk book

None of these are patient-facing ROI/authorization for release of health information forms.

### 4. Disambiguation note
Search results frequently confused this facility with **King's Daughters Health System** in Ashland, KY (kingsdaughtershealth.com), which is an entirely different organization. That Kentucky system does have a downloadable authorization form, but it is not related to this Brookhaven, MS facility.

## Medical Records Request Process
KDMC Brookhaven uses **Datavant (formerly Swellbox)** for medical records requests via an online wizard at:
- https://www.swellbox.com/kings-daughters-mc-wizard.html
- Cost: $6.50 flat fee + $0.12 per page
- Records fulfilled by Datavant; patient receives invoice from Datavant
- Requires photo ID for pickup
- Phone contact: 601-835-9276 (Datavant customer service) or 601-835-9282 (Health Information Records dept)

There is no downloadable PDF form — the process is entirely online through the Datavant wizard.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.kdmc.org/documents/KDMC-Joint-Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf
- **Document type**: Joint Notice of Privacy Practices (NOT an ROI form)
- **Description**: Standard HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices covering patient rights, organizational uses/disclosures, and complaint procedures. 1 page.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.kdmc.org/documents/KDMC-Occ-Health-Authorization-Form-Revised.pdf
- **Document type**: Employer/Occupational Health Authorization Form (NOT an ROI form)
- **Description**: Form for employers to authorize occupational health services (DOT physicals, pre-employment physicals, drug/alcohol testing, etc.) for their employees. Not a patient-facing medical records release form.

## Difficulties Encountered
1. **No ROI form available online**: KDMC Brookhaven does not publish a downloadable authorization for release of health information form. They have fully outsourced the records request process to Datavant's online wizard.
2. **Name confusion**: The name "King's Daughters Medical Center" / "KDMC" is shared with an entirely separate health system in Kentucky, which caused search engines to return irrelevant results from kingsdaughtershealth.com.
3. **Limited PDF resources**: The website has very few downloadable patient forms of any kind.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Hard
No ROI form exists as a downloadable PDF on the organization's website. The records request process is exclusively handled through a third-party online platform (Datavant/Swellbox).
