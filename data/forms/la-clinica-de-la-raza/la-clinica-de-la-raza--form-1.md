# Evaluation: La Clínica de La Raza — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page "Authorization to Release/Disclose Information" form dated 2015 Revision, sourced from `https://laclinicahealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Authorization-to-Release-Information-english.pdf`. **Critically, this form does not belong to the target organization.** It belongs to La Clinica del Valle, located at "3617 S. Pacific Hwy., Medford, OR 97501" — an entirely different organization (La Clinica Health Centers in Oregon) that shares a similar name with La Clínica de La Raza (Oakland, CA). The form's revocation clause explicitly directs written revocations to "La Clinica del Valle at 3617 S. Pacific Hwy., Medford, OR 97501."

Three documents were collected for this organization directory:
- **form-1.pdf** (this document): Wrong organization — La Clinica del Valle, Oregon
- **form-2.pdf**: Also wrong organization — La Clinica Health Centers, Oregon (August 2022 revision, marked "OR PCD")
- **form-3.pdf**: Correct organization — La Clínica de La Raza's Notice of Privacy Practices (FORM 8092, 10/12 revision), but this is not an ROI form

No actual ROI form from La Clínica de La Raza was found online.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was found via web search rather than through La Clínica de La Raza's own website. The retrieval notes describe extensive search efforts — multiple Google queries with filetype:pdf, direct website navigation on laclinica.org, URL guessing against common upload patterns, and Wayback Machine checks. All searches for La Clínica de La Raza ROI forms either returned nothing or surfaced forms from the similarly-named Oregon organization (laclinicahealth.org).

La Clínica de La Raza's website (laclinica.org) has no "Medical Records," "Forms," or "Release of Information" section. The only patient-facing privacy document published is the Notice of Privacy Practices, which instructs patients to write to "La Clínica de La Raza, Inc., Attention: Privacy Officer, P.O. Box 22210, Oakland, CA 94623." The retrieval difficulty is rated **Hard / No form found online**.

Since this form belongs to a different organization, it has zero findability from La Clínica de La Raza's perspective. A patient searching for La Clínica de La Raza's ROI form could easily be misled into using this Oregon-based form, which would be invalid.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Format**: PDF, 220,695 bytes (221 KB), 2 pages
- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (5,355 characters)
- **Fillable fields**: 0 — none of the form's many checkboxes, text fields, or signature lines are interactive. The form must be printed and filled by hand.
- **Fonts**: 8 embedded fonts
- **Images**: 1 embedded image (likely the organization logo)
- **Scan status**: Not an image-only scan; it has a proper text layer

The form is a static, print-oriented PDF. Despite having a text layer (so it can be read by screen readers and searched), the complete absence of fillable fields means patients must print, hand-write, and physically deliver or mail the form. There is no evidence of digital-first design — no electronic signature capability, no form field validation, no submit button.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure**: The form is organized across two pages:
- Page 1: Patient identifiers, source/destination of records, purpose checkboxes, family member disclosure authorization, record type selection with 24 checkbox options, and date range
- Page 2: Sensitive information release (requiring individual initials for each category), legal disclosures ("I UNDERSTAND THAT" section), signature block, and staff-use section

**Checkbox richness**: The form offers 24 specific record-type checkboxes organized in three columns: "Complete Record – Past Two Years," "Complete Record," "Consultations," "Dental Exams," "Discharge Summary," "ER Report(s)," "History & Physical," "Medical Exam(s)," "Health Screenings," "Safety Concerns/Suspected Abuse," "Immunizations," "Inpatient Information," "Laboratory Reports," "Medication Records," "Counseling/Mental Health Support," "Probation & Parole Information," "Educational Information," "Special Education Records," "Office/Progress Notes," "Operative Report," "Outpatient Information," "Imaging Report(s)," "Itemized Billing Records," plus "Other." This is an unusually detailed and granular set of options.

**Purpose options**: Four checkboxes — "Continuity of Care," "Copies for Own Use," "Insurance," "Legal," and an "Other" write-in.

**Language**: The legal section on page 2 is moderately dense but includes appropriate CFR citations (45 CFR§164.508 (c)(2)(iii) and (c)(2)(ii)). The helper text in parentheses (e.g., "Who has the information you want released? Please list the specific Hospital or Clinic.") is a positive patient-facing feature. The sensitive information section uses clear category labels.

**Sensitive information**: Nine categories requiring separate initials — Drug Abuse, Alcoholism, STD, Mental Health, Sickle Cell Anemia, Genetic Testing, Psychological Evaluation, Mental Health Assessment Summary, and HIV/AIDS. This properly implements the additional-consent requirements for 42 CFR Part 2 and state-level protections.

**Layout concerns**: Three columns of 24 checkboxes on page 1 makes the record-type section dense. The dual "Place Site Location Stamp Here" blocks suggest the form was designed for internal clinic use where staff stamp locations, which may confuse patients filling out the form independently.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is a general-purpose authorization for release of information. It includes "Copies for Own Use" as a purpose option, but the form's design is oriented toward third-party disclosure — it asks for both "from" and "to" entities, framed as transferring records between providers or to third parties. A patient requesting their own records must fill in themselves as the "to" recipient, which, while functional, is not intuitive.

**Family member disclosure section**: The form includes a dedicated section for authorizing ongoing family member access to medical or billing information, with fields for two individuals' names and relationships. This is a useful feature but conflates two distinct functions — point-in-time record release and standing verbal/records authorization — on a single form.

**Delivery format**: The staff-use section at the bottom lists "Patient Pick-Up," "Faxed," "Mailed," or "Other" — but these are for staff to mark after processing. The patient has no way to specify their preferred delivery format on the form itself.

**No electronic delivery option**: There is no mention of email, patient portal, or electronic format options. This is a 2015-era form that predates common expectations for digital delivery.

**No mention of patient rights**: Beyond the required HIPAA authorization disclosures, the form does not explain the patient's right of access under 45 CFR § 164.524, response timeframes, or fee limitations.

**School-based health center language**: The form includes language about "school-based health centers" and "Student Full Name" in the header, and "Educational Information" and "Special Education Records" among the record types. This reflects La Clinica Health Centers' (Oregon) program scope and would be confusing for patients at La Clínica de La Raza.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: "This authorization shall expire one (1) year after the date signed unless a different expiration date or event is entered here." A one-year default expiration is standard and reasonable.

**Right to refuse**: The form correctly states: "I am not required to sign this authorization. Refusal to sign the authorization will not adversely affect my ability to receive health care services or reimbursement for services." This is the required HIPAA statement.

**Revocation**: Patients may revoke "in writing at any time by sending a written statement to: La Clinica del Valle at 3617 S. Pacific Hwy., Medford, OR 97501." This is the Oregon address — clearly wrong for any Oakland patient.

**Witness signature**: The form includes a "Witness Signature" and "Printed Name of Witness" field. While not explicitly required, the presence of a witness line could be interpreted by patients as a mandatory requirement, potentially creating a barrier.

**No fees disclosed**: The form does not mention any fees for copying records.

**Re-disclosure warning**: Appropriately included with CFR citation.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Wrong organization entirely**: This form belongs to La Clinica del Valle (Medford, Oregon), not La Clínica de La Raza (Oakland, CA). An Oakland patient who finds and submits this form would be sending their authorization to the wrong entity at the wrong address. The revocation address ("La Clinica del Valle at 3617 S. Pacific Hwy., Medford, OR 97501") confirms this is a different organization's form.
- **No ROI form available online**: La Clínica de La Raza does not publish any authorization/ROI form on their website. Patients must apparently contact the clinic by phone or visit in person to obtain the form — a significant access barrier for a federally qualified health center serving a predominantly underserved population.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Witness signature field**: The form includes witness signature and printed name fields without indicating whether a witness is required or optional. Patients may assume they need a witness, delaying or preventing form submission.
- **Conflation of release types**: The form bundles one-time record release, standing family-member authorization, and verbal discussion authorization into a single form, which may confuse patients about what they're actually authorizing.
- **"Place Site Location Stamp Here" boxes**: Two stamp-box areas on page 1 suggest the form is designed for in-clinic staff use, not for patient self-service. A patient filling this out at home would not know what to put in these areas.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Misattribution**: This form was retrieved as if it belonged to La Clínica de La Raza but is actually from La Clinica del Valle / La Clinica Health Centers (Oregon). This is due to search engine conflation of similarly-named organizations, not an error in the form itself — but it means this document is irrelevant to the target organization.
- **Outdated form (2015)**: The form is labeled "2015 Revision" while the same Oregon organization has an updated 2022 version (form-2.pdf). If a patient were to use this form for the Oregon organization, they'd be using an obsolete version.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular record-type selection**: The 24-checkbox grid for specifying exactly which record types to release is unusually detailed, giving patients fine-grained control over what information is shared.
- **Parenthetical helper text**: Instructions like "(Who has the information you want released? Please list the specific Hospital or Clinic.)" and "(Where do you want the information sent or who may have the information?)" use plain, patient-friendly language to clarify legal concepts.
- **Proper sensitive-information segmentation**: The nine-category initial-required section for sensitive information (substance abuse, STDs, HIV/AIDS, mental health, genetic testing, sickle cell anemia) correctly implements additional consent requirements and gives patients category-level control.
