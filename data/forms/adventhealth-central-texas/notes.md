# AdventHealth Central Texas — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for "AdventHealth Central Texas authorization release health information medical records form PDF" — immediately surfaced two direct PDF links from adventhealth.com.
2. **Web search** for AdventHealth system-wide ROI forms — confirmed the same URLs and identified the parent system's medical records page at adventhealth.com/medical-records.
3. **Site-specific search** for adventhealth.com medical records — confirmed records request process and contact information.

The first web search was sufficient; both forms were directly linked from AdventHealth's CDN.

## Difficulties

- None. Both forms were easily discoverable via web search and downloaded without issues (no bot blocking, no login walls).
- The system-wide form (form-1) references Illinois law despite being served in a Texas context, which is a notable finding for the evaluation stage.
