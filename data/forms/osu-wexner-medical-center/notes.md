## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/-/media/files/wexnermedical/patient-care/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records/authorization-to-release-medical-information-112619.pdf
- **File size**: 231,492 bytes
- **Pages**: 1
- **Description**: Authorization to Release Medical Information form. This is an **image-only scan** (no text layer). Created with "Global Graphics Harlequin RIP" — appears to be a scanned paper form. The filename suggests it was last updated 11/26/2019.
- **Initial impression**: This is the standalone ROI authorization form, but as an image-only scan it has no extractable text and no fillable fields.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/-/media/files/wexnermedical/patient-care/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records/roi-form-and-instructions.pdf
- **File size**: 206,282 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Description**: Combined ROI form with instructions. Page 1 contains detailed instructions for completing the form. Page 2 appears to contain the authorization form itself. Created with Adobe Acrobat Pro — has a full text layer.
- **Initial impression**: This is the more complete/useful version — it includes both instructions and the authorization form, with extractable text. The form includes checkboxes for specific record types (Emergency Dept Records, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, etc.), purpose of disclosure options, and facility selection. Requires wet ink signature or eSignature with date/time stamp.

## Difficulties
- **None significant**. The forms were easy to find via web search and directly linked from the organization's medical records page.
- form-1.pdf is an image-only scan with no text layer, which limits accessibility.
- The organization provides two versions: a standalone scanned form and a combined instructions+form document created in Adobe Acrobat Pro.

## Retrieval Difficulty: Easy
Forms were found on the first web search attempt with direct download links. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues.
