# Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `Philadelphia FIGHT "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — did not return direct PDF links but indicated forms exist on the website.
2. **Web search** for `site:fight.org authorization release medical records` — surfaced the **Forms and Consents** page at `https://fight.org/about/forms-and-consents/`.
3. **Navigated directly** to the Forms and Consents page, which lists all patient forms in both English and Spanish.

The Forms and Consents page was easy to find (About → Forms and Consents) and clearly organized with direct PDF download links.
