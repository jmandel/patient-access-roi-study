## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a dedicated **patient access request form** — specifically for patients (or their legally authorized representatives) requesting access to their own protected health information under HIPAA's Right of Access. The form title is "PATIENT REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION," and the opening paragraph explicitly states: "A FIGHT Patient or legally authorized representative has a right to access the Patient's protected health information ('PHI'), which includes a right to inspect or copy the Patient's PHI, or both."

Philadelphia FIGHT maintains a separate companion form (form-2.pdf, "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Information," dated 8.2024) for third-party release/disclosure. This two-form approach correctly distinguishes between a patient exercising their right of access and a patient authorizing disclosure to a third party — a meaningful structural distinction that many organizations fail to make.

Both forms were found on the same "Forms and Consents" page (https://fight.org/about/forms-and-consents/), where form-1 was listed as "Request for Access to Information Form."

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was easy to locate. Per the retrieval notes, navigating to the Forms and Consents page required going to About → Forms and Consents, which is a clear, logical path. The page provides direct PDF download links with descriptive link text ("Request for Access to Information Form"). A web search for `site:fight.org authorization release medical records` surfaced the page.

The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PRFATI.pdf`) is a WordPress media upload path. The filename "PRFATI" is an internal abbreviation (likely "Patient Request For Access To Information") that would not be meaningful to a patient encountering the raw URL, but since the link text on the website is descriptive, this is a minor issue. The retrieval difficulty was rated "easy" with no obstacles encountered.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present — the full text (3,722 characters) is extractable, confirming this is a natively digital document, not a scan.

**Fillable fields:** Zero (0). Despite being a digital-origin PDF, the form has no interactive form fields. All blanks are represented as underscores (`_______________`) requiring the patient to either print and hand-fill, or use PDF annotation tools. This is a significant missed opportunity given the document was clearly created digitally (7 fonts, 1 embedded image, clean text layer).

**Page count:** 1 page. Compact and efficient.

**File size:** 172,292 bytes (~168 KB) for a single page — reasonable, though slightly large given the minimal content. The embedded image (likely an organizational logo) accounts for much of this.

**Digital-first design:** Mixed. The document was created digitally (not a scan), but the lack of fillable fields means it does not function as an interactive digital form. A patient filling this out digitally would need to use workaround methods rather than native PDF form controls.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality:** At one page, the form is appropriately concise. It covers the necessary elements without unnecessary bulk.

**Structure:** The form follows a logical flow:
1. Introductory paragraph explaining rights and process
2. Patient identification (name, DOB)
3. Scope of request (entire medical record, entire billing record, or specific records)
4. Access method (copy vs. inspection appointment)
5. Format preference (paper vs. electronic)
6. Delivery method (pick up vs. mail)
7. Requester identification (self, guardian, or representative)
8. Signature and date
9. Internal-use section (approved/denied)
10. Submission instructions

**Language:** The introductory paragraph is moderately dense, front-loading legal/procedural information about timelines, costs, and denial rights. The sentence beginning "FIGHT will charge the Patient for the following costs..." runs to 65+ words with four enumerated cost categories embedded inline. While accurate, this could be more readable if broken into bullet points. The overall reading level is moderately complex but not egregiously legalistic.

**Layout:** The form uses checkbox-based options (☐ YES ☐ NO, ☐ Paper Copies, ☐ Electronic Format) which are clear and structured. Visual hierarchy is achieved through the bold title and sectional flow, though the form does not use explicit section headers or dividing lines beyond the "FOR INTERNAL FIGHT USE ONLY" divider at the bottom.

**Minor layout issue:** The "Instructions regarding copies" section has a checkbox "I will pick the copies" (missing the word "up") — this reads as a minor grammatical error or truncation.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access focus:** This form is explicitly and exclusively designed for patient access requests, not third-party release. This is evident from the title, the opening rights statement, and the absence of any "release to" third-party fields. This is a best practice.

**Scope options:** The form offers three levels of granularity:
- Entire medical record (yes/no checkbox)
- Entire billing record (yes/no checkbox)
- Specific information with free-text description ("including dates, specific tests, or any other indications")

This gives patients flexibility to request exactly what they need.

**Format options:** The form explicitly offers both "Paper Copies" and "Electronic Format" with a "Specify: ___" field for the electronic format. This is good — it acknowledges the patient's right to receive records in electronic form and allows them to name a preferred format.

**Delivery options:** Pick up or mail. No mention of email, portal, or other digital delivery mechanisms. The mail option includes fields for recipient name and address.

**Right of Access language:** The opening paragraph explicitly references the right to access PHI and the right to inspect or copy. It does not cite a specific HIPAA section number (e.g., § 164.524), but the substance is correct.

**EHI/bulk data:** No mention of electronic health information export, patient portal access, or bulk data download options.

**Representative access:** The form handles multiple requester categories well: self (adult or adolescent 13+), legal guardian/parent (with sub-options for pediatric 0-12 and adolescent 13-17), and legally authorized representative (with fields for name, DOB, and description of legal authority). The adolescent age differentiation (13+ can self-request) reflects Pennsylvania-specific consent laws.

**Submission methods:** Listed at the bottom: "in person at any Philadelphia FIGHT Health Center, via email to privacy@fight.org, via fax 215-732-1145 Attention: Privacy Officer, or via mail." This provides four submission channels including email and fax, which is good.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fees/costs:** The introductory paragraph states FIGHT will charge for: "(1) labor for copying the requested PHI, whether on paper or electronic form, consistent with then current Pennsylvania law; (2) supplies for creating the paper copy or electronic media; (3) postage, when the Patient requests that FIGHT mail the information; and (4) preparation of an explanation or summary of the PHI, if agreed to by the Individual." The phrase "consistent with then current Pennsylvania law" is a reasonable framework, though no specific dollar amounts are provided. Notably, under HIPAA's Right of Access rule, fees for patient access requests are limited to reasonable cost-based fees, and the form's fee language could be read as going beyond what HIPAA permits for patient access (e.g., "labor for copying" is permissible under state law frameworks but must be constrained to "reasonable" under federal rules).

**Denial rights:** The form states: "Under some circumstances, such as increased risk of harm or injury, FIGHT may deny the Patient's request for access to PHI." This is a legitimate carve-out under HIPAA (§ 164.524(a)(2)-(3)), though the form does not mention the patient's right to request a review of the denial, which HIPAA requires for certain types of denials.

**Timelines:** The form correctly states 30 days to respond, with possible 60-day extension.

**No notarization requirement.** No ID verification requirements mentioned beyond the signature. No unreasonable barriers to submission.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Separate patient access form:** Philadelphia FIGHT correctly maintains distinct forms for patient access (form-1) vs. third-party release (form-2). Many organizations force patients through a generic authorization form even for self-access requests. This is a best practice worth emulating.
- **Multiple submission channels:** Four options (in person, email, fax, mail) including email to privacy@fight.org — a low-barrier digital option that many organizations do not offer.
- **Electronic format option:** The form explicitly offers electronic format with an open "Specify" field, letting patients name their preferred electronic format.
- **Adolescent self-access at 13+:** The form respects Pennsylvania minor consent law by allowing adolescents 13 and older to make their own access requests, with appropriate guardian/parent pathways for younger patients.
- **Bilingual availability:** Per the retrieval notes, the Forms and Consents page offers forms in both English and Spanish.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Fee language is vague on amounts:** The form describes four categories of chargeable costs but provides no fee schedule, rate estimates, or cap. A patient reading this would not know whether to expect a $5 charge or a $500 charge. The reference to "consistent with then current Pennsylvania law" does not help most patients understand what to expect.
- **"Costs will be submitted to the Patient after FIGHT fulfills the request"** — this means the patient does not learn the cost before committing to the request. There is no mechanism described for a cost estimate or for the patient to limit spending.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **"I will pick the copies"** — missing the word "up" ("I will pick up the copies"). Minor grammatical error.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No mention of right to appeal a denial:** The form states FIGHT may deny access but does not inform the patient of their right to request a review of the denial, which is required under HIPAA § 164.524(d)(4) for reviewable denials. The internal-use section routes denials to the Privacy Officer but does not communicate next steps to the patient.
