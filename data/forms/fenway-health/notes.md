# Fenway Health — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Fenway Health
- **Location:** Boston, MA
- **Type:** FQHC, independent, nonprofit
- **Website:** https://fenwayhealth.org

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDF directly** — `"Fenway Health" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return direct results.
2. **Web search for medical records form** — `"Fenway Health" Boston "medical records" "release form" OR "authorization form"` — **successful**. Found the direct PDF URL and the medical records page at https://fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/.
3. **Site-scoped search** — `site:fenwayhealth.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the form URL and also surfaced a FAQ sheet PDF.
4. **Spanish version search** — found a separate Spanish-language version of the ROI form.

## What Worked
The second web search was the most effective, immediately returning the direct PDF URL for the English ROI form, the FAQ sheet, and the medical records landing page. Fenway Health makes their forms readily accessible on a dedicated medical records page.

## Downloaded Files

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FHROIForm10202025.pdf
- **File size:** 205,305 bytes
- **Description:** Fenway Health Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (English). This is the primary ROI form. It includes sections for patient information, sender/recipient details, reason for release, type of information to disclose, sensitive information categories (requiring initials), and legal notice/signature. The form has a text layer and appears to be a digitally-created PDF (not a scan). It includes specific protections for reproductive health care and gender-affirming care, reflecting Massachusetts law.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ReleaseofInformationFAQSheet.pdf
- **File size:** 87,588 bytes
- **Description:** ROI Form FAQ Sheet — a companion guide that explains each section of the ROI form in detail. It provides instructions for patients on how to correctly fill out each field, explains the different options for reason for release, type of information, and sensitive information categories. Not an ROI form itself, but a helpful patient-facing document that accompanies the form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ReleaseofInformationMedicalRecordsFormSpanish10312025.pdf
- **File size:** 226,856 bytes
- **Description:** Spanish-language version of the ROI form (Autorización de Fenway Health Para Divulgar Información De Salud Protegida). Same structure as form-1.pdf but fully translated into Spanish.

## Difficulties Encountered
- None. Forms were easy to find and download without any bot-blocking or access barriers.

## Additional Observations
- Fenway Health has a dedicated medical records page (https://fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/) with clear instructions for submitting the form via fax, email, or mail.
- The form can also be submitted through the MyChart patient portal.
- Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (per the FAQ sheet).
- The form includes robust protections for sensitive health information categories, requiring explicit patient initials for each category (behavioral health, HIV/AIDS, substance use, genetic testing, abortion care, etc.).
- The form explicitly addresses gender-affirming care protections under Massachusetts law.
