# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `"Lakeland Regional Health" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — this immediately returned two direct PDF URLs on mylrh.org.
2. **Site-scoped search**: Searched `site:mylrh.org authorization release medical records` — confirmed the medical records page at https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/.
3. **Medical Records page review**: Fetched the medical records page directly, which links to a 2022 version of the authorization form (different URL than the 2018 version found via search), plus a digital intake option via Swellbox.

## URLs and Downloads

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mylrh.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Authorization-to-Use-or-Disclose-PHI-1.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information (ROI form)
- **Notes**: Older version (dated LRH 04/16). 1 page, ~463 KB. Full text layer. Offers Paper or Electronic delivery options. Includes checkboxes for specific record types (abstracts, lab reports, operative reports, radiology, billing, etc.). References Florida Statute 395.3025 for fees. Authorization valid for 6 months. Includes redaction option for mental health/substance abuse/HIV.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mylrh.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Release-Authorization-Form.pdf
- **Document type**: LRH Physicians Group Release/Authorization Form
- **Notes**: This is primarily an insurance assignment and general authorization form for the physician group practice, not a patient-initiated ROI form. It covers authorization to release information to insurance carriers, Medicare/Medicaid assignment, financial responsibility, and consent to treatment. Not the same as a patient records request form.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.mylrh.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Authorization-to-Use-or-Disclose-PHI.pdf
- **Document type**: Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information (ROI form — current version)
- **Notes**: Updated version (dated LRH 01/22, ~87 KB). This is the version currently linked from the Medical Records page. Nearly identical to form-1 but adds "MyChart Patient Portal" as a delivery option alongside Paper and Electronic. This appears to be the current/active version of the ROI form.

## Difficulties

- No significant difficulties. Forms were easily discoverable via web search and directly linked from the medical records page.
- The organization also offers an electronic intake system via Swellbox (http://www.swellbox.com/lakeland-wizard.html) as an alternative to the PDF form.
- Two versions of the hospital ROI form exist at different URLs (2018 upload vs 2022 upload); the 2022 version is the one currently linked from the medical records page.

## Summary

Lakeland Regional Health makes their ROI form readily available. The current form (form-3.pdf) is a single-page, text-based PDF with delivery options including Paper, Electronic (email), and MyChart Patient Portal. The physician group has a separate form (form-2.pdf) that is more of an insurance/billing authorization than a patient records release form.
