# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is **not** a patient-initiated Release of Information (ROI) form. The document is titled "LRH PHYSICIANS GROUP RELEASE/AUTHORIZATION FORM" (document code CONS00306 (05), dated LRH 03/20) and serves as a multi-purpose intake/consent form for the physician group practice. It covers nine distinct topics across 2 pages:

1. Authorization to disclose information **to insurance carriers** for payment processing
2. Irrevocable assignment of insurance benefits and appointment as authorized representative
3. Medicaid authorization
4. Lifetime Medicare assignment authorization
5. Statement of financial responsibility
6. Authorization for medical/surgical treatment
7. Notice about physician assistants, APRNs, and CNMs
8. Release of responsibility for personal articles
9. Electronic health care records / Patient Portal acknowledgment

In context of the three forms found for Lakeland Regional Health: form-1.pdf and form-3.pdf are actual patient-facing "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" forms (the true ROI forms, with form-3 being the current version). Form-2 is a fundamentally different document — it is a provider-initiated, multi-purpose intake consent bundle primarily designed to secure insurance assignment and financial responsibility, not to facilitate a patient's request for their own records.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found via a general web search for `"Lakeland Regional Health" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` and is hosted at `https://www.mylrh.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Release-Authorization-Form.pdf`. Despite the filename "Release-Authorization-Form.pdf," this is not the form a patient would need to request their own medical records. The actual ROI form (form-3.pdf) is linked from the Medical Records page at `https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/`. This form's discoverability is somewhat misleading — its title and URL could easily confuse a patient searching for a records release form into downloading the wrong document.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present and fully extractable (11,570 characters across 2 pages).
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive PDF form fields despite having a structured header area with labeled fields (NAME, ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP, DOB, INSURANCE COMPANY NAME, GROUP #, POLICY #, PHYSICIAN, etc.). All of these are static text labels with no fillable counterpart.
- **File size**: 109,376 bytes (~107 KB) for 2 pages with no embedded images — reasonable.
- **Font count**: 4 fonts.
- **Design origin**: This appears to be a digitally-created document (not a scan), but it is a flat PDF designed to be printed and filled by hand. The dense, wall-of-text layout on pages 1–2 with minimal whitespace reinforces this as a print-era artifact.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages, approximately 11,570 characters of text. The form packs nine distinct legal sections into this space, making it extremely dense.

**Clarity**: The language is overwhelmingly legalistic. Nearly every sentence is a compound-complex construction with multiple embedded clauses. For example, Section 1 contains a single sentence of approximately 100 words: *"The undersigned hereby authorizes Lakeland Regional Health Systems, Inc. d/b/a Lakeland Regional Health Physicians Group (LRHPG) to release and obtain information from insurance carriers listed in the patient's record or any insurance carrier represented as contractually responsible for payment in whole or in part of the patient's health care bill and such diagnostic and therapeutic information and records (including any treatment or testing for mental illness, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or HIV/AIDS) as may be necessary to determine benefits entitlement and to process payment claims for health care provided to the above-named patient."* This is well beyond a typical patient reading level.

**Organization**: Sections are numbered 1–9, which provides some structure, but there is no visual hierarchy — each section runs directly into the next with identical formatting. The header area with patient/insurance fields is visually distinct from the legal text body, but the nine legal paragraphs are an undifferentiated wall of text.

**Signature area**: The form requires signatures from the patient, a guarantor, a co-guarantor, and two witnesses — six signature lines total. This is an unusually heavy signature burden for an intake form.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This document is fundamentally not patient-centered for the purpose of records access:

- **Not a patient access form**: This form does not enable a patient to request their own health records. It is a provider-initiated consent form that authorizes the organization to disclose information to insurers, share records with other providers, contact the patient by phone/text, and assign insurance benefits.
- **No scope options for patient**: The patient has no ability to select what information is shared or with whom — the authorization is blanket and covers "diagnostic and therapeutic information and records (including any treatment or testing for mental illness, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or HIV/AIDS)."
- **No delivery format options**: No choice of paper, electronic, or portal delivery for the patient.
- **No HIPAA Right of Access reference**: The form does not reference 45 CFR § 164.524 or the patient's right to access their own records.
- **No EHI export mention**: No reference to electronic health information export or bulk data access.
- **Section 9 mentions Patient Portal**: The only patient-facing access element is Section 9, which acknowledges the existence of a "free, secure, web-based method for patients to access portions of their medical records (Patient Portal)." However, this is informational only — it does not constitute a mechanism for requesting records.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

Several compliance-relevant observations:

- **Irrevocable assignment**: Section 2 is titled "IRREVOCABLE ASSIGNMENT FOR INSURANCE BENEFITS." The irrevocable nature of the insurance benefit assignment, combined with an instruction that "I agree to forward to LRHPG all insurance, benefits, and other third-party payments that I receive for services rendered to me immediately upon receipt," creates a strong financial obligation.
- **Broad consent bundling**: This single form bundles at least six distinct authorizations: (1) information release to insurers, (2) irrevocable insurance assignment, (3) Medicaid/Medicare authorization, (4) financial responsibility, (5) medical treatment consent, and (6) electronic communications consent. Patients sign once at the bottom to agree to all nine sections simultaneously.
- **Lifetime Medicare authorization**: Section 4 explicitly states "I understand that this is a lifetime authorization" for Medicare assignment — an unusually long duration.
- **Collection costs and attorney's fees**: Section 5 states the patient "agrees to pay all collection expenses, including LRHPG's reasonable attorney's fees."
- **18-month insurance disclosure authorization**: Section 1's authorization for insurance information release "shall cease to be valid 18 months from this date."
- **Automated calls and texts**: Section 1 authorizes contact "by telephone (including wireless or cellular phone)... through the use of automated dialing technology and/or pre-recorded messages" and Section 1's final paragraph authorizes text messages.
- **Witness requirement**: Two witness signatures are required, which adds procedural burden.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Massive consent bundling**: Nine distinct legal authorizations — ranging from treatment consent to insurance assignment to robocall consent to personal property liability waivers — are bundled into a single form with a single signature block. A patient cannot agree to treatment but decline the irrevocable insurance assignment, or consent to records sharing but opt out of automated phone calls. This level of bundling is coercive by design.
- **Irrevocable insurance assignment**: Section 2's "IRREVOCABLE ASSIGNMENT FOR INSURANCE BENEFITS" language, combined with "LRHPG may transfer this assignment at its discretion" and "Any waiver of this assignment, or appointment, must be in writing from an authorized LRHPG representative," creates an unusually one-sided financial arrangement that patients may not understand they are agreeing to.
- **Lifetime Medicare authorization**: "I understand that this is a lifetime authorization" in Section 4 is an extraordinary duration with no expiration or periodic re-consent mechanism.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Misleading title**: The form is called "RELEASE/AUTHORIZATION FORM," which could easily be confused with a patient-initiated ROI/release form. The filename "Release-Authorization-Form.pdf" compounds this confusion. A patient searching for a way to request their records could download this form by mistake.
- **Foundation data sharing unclear**: Section 1 authorizes release of records "to Lakeland Regional Medical Center Foundation, Inc. to be used only for its educational, scientific, and charitable purposes." The scope of "charitable purposes" is undefined and could encompass fundraising outreach, which patients may not anticipate.
- **Sensitive information opt-out absent**: Unlike the actual ROI forms (form-1 and form-3) which offer a redaction option for mental health/substance abuse/HIV, this form explicitly includes "any treatment or testing for mental illness, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or HIV/AIDS" with no opt-out mechanism.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Garbled text artifact**: The extracted text includes `*4cnt*` at the bottom of page 1, which appears to be a barcode or form tracking code that rendered as garbled text — a minor formatting defect.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Patient Portal acknowledgment**: Section 9 proactively informs patients about the existence of a free Patient Portal and health information exchange participation. While this section is buried in a dense legal form, it at least surfaces the concept of electronic patient access.
- **PA/APRN/CNM disclosure**: Section 7 provides an unusually detailed and transparent disclosure about the use of physician extenders, including an explicit right to decline being seen by a PA, APRN, or CNM on the initial visit — with a dedicated signature line for that declination.
