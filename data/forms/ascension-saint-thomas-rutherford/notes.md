# Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization
- **Name:** Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital
- **Location:** Murfreesboro, TN
- **Website:** https://healthcare.ascension.org/locations/tennessee/tnnas/murfreesboro-ascension-saint-thomas-rutherford-hospital
- **Parent System:** Ascension (major nonprofit health system)

## Search Strategies

### What I tried
1. **Web search for PDFs**: Searched for `"Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — did not return a direct hit.
2. **Web search for medical records release form**: Searched for `"Ascension Saint Thomas Rutherford" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — **found direct link** to the Authorization for Disclosure of PHI PDF on Ascension's website.
3. **Site-scoped search**: Searched `site:healthcare.ascension.org authorization release medical records` — returned general Ascension results with links to forms from various markets (Illinois, Texas, Florida, etc.).
4. **Patient portal page**: Navigated to https://healthcare.ascension.org/patient-portal/tennessee-ascension-saint-thomas — found the "Medical records request" section which links to an online Swellbox-based records request wizard (https://www.swellbox.com/ascension-stthomas-wizard.html) rather than a downloadable form.
5. **Searched for patient-specific access form**: Searched for Ascension Saint Thomas "request my records" or "patient access" form PDF — no separate patient access form found; the Authorization for Disclosure of PHI is the single form used.

### What worked
The second web search directly returned a citation to the PDF URL on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure.

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL:** https://healthcare.ascension.org/-/media/project/ascension/healthcare/legacy/markets/tennessee/st-thomas/documents/sths409-authorization-for-disclosure-of-phi-1.pdf
- **File size:** 744,156 bytes (744 KB)
- **Pages:** 1
- **Document type:** Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)
- **Description:** A single-page authorization form covering all Ascension Saint Thomas facilities (DeKalb, Hickman, River Park, Rutherford, Medical Partners, Highlands, Stones River, Midtown, West). The form includes checkboxes for selecting the facility, fields for patient name/SSN/DOB/phone, recipient information, purpose of disclosure, type and date range of records, and signature. It explicitly lists Saint Thomas Rutherford with its HIM department phone number (615-396-4130). The form has a text layer (not a scan) and mentions options for mail or email delivery. Form number STHS490, revised 02/04/20.
- **Initial impression:** This is a general ROI/authorization form — it handles both patient access and third-party release in one form. It's not specifically a "patient access" form but rather a general authorization for disclosure.

## Additional Notes
- The Ascension Saint Thomas patient portal page offers an online medical records request through Swellbox (a third-party vendor), which is a web-based wizard rather than a downloadable PDF form.
- No separate patient-specific "right of access" form was found — the single Authorization for Disclosure of PHI form serves all purposes.
- The form is hosted on Ascension's legacy content infrastructure (`-/media/project/ascension/healthcare/legacy/markets/tennessee/`), suggesting it predates Ascension's current website architecture.
- The form is relatively large (744 KB) for a single-page document, likely due to embedded images/logos.

## Difficulties
- No significant difficulties. The form was found via a direct web search on the second query. The PDF downloaded without issues (no bot blocking or JavaScript requirements).
