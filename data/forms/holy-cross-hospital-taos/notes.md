# Holy Cross Hospital (Taos, NM) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Info
- **Name**: Holy Cross Hospital (Holy Cross Medical Center)
- **Website**: https://holycrossmedicalcenter.org
- **Location**: Taos, NM 87571 (1397 Weimer Rd)
- **Type**: Critical access hospital, independent, nonprofit
- **Also known as**: Taos Health Systems, Inc. (legal name); staff emails use @taoshospital.org

## Result: No ROI form found online

Holy Cross Medical Center does not publish a Release of Information / Authorization for Medical Records form on their website.

## Search Strategies Tried

### 1. Web searches (multiple queries)
- `"Holy Cross Hospital" Taos NM "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no results
- `"Holy Cross Medical Center" Taos NM medical records request release authorization form download` — no direct form found
- `site:holycrossmedicalcenter.org authorization release medical records` — no form found on the site; results confused with Holy Cross Health (Maryland), a completely different organization
- `"taoshospital.org" OR "holycrossmedicalcenter.org" "release of information" form` — no results
- `holycrossmedicalcenter.org wp-content uploads authorization release form PDF` — no form found
- `"Holy Cross Hospital" Taos "release" form pdf` — no results specific to Taos location

### 2. Website navigation (via browser)
- **Forms page** (https://holycrossmedicalcenter.org/forms/): Page exists but is completely empty — only has the heading "FORMS" with no content or links
- **Patients & Visitors** (https://holycrossmedicalcenter.org/patient-visitor-information/): No link to medical records or ROI section. Subpages cover policies, billing, advocacy but nothing about records release
- **Privacy Practices** page: Contains full Notice of Privacy Practices text (mentions right to access records) but no link to an ROI form
- **Patient Portal** page: Describes MyCareCorner portal for accessing visit info; no ROI form link
- **Site search** for "medical records release": Returns "Nothing Found"

### 3. Wayback Machine
- Checked archived version of /forms/ page (October 2024 capture) — page was also empty at that time, confirming the forms page has never had content

### 4. Third-party sources
- medicalrecords.com listing confirms the hospital exists (25-bed acute care, NPI 1902338049) but offers its own paid service rather than linking to the hospital's form
- No form found through any third-party medical records request service

## Difficulties Encountered
- **Empty forms page**: The website has a dedicated /forms/ page that contains no actual forms — this appears to be a placeholder that was never populated (created June 2022, never updated)
- **Name confusion**: Multiple unrelated "Holy Cross" healthcare organizations exist (Holy Cross Health in Maryland/Florida, Providence Holy Cross in California), which polluted search results
- **No medical records section**: Unlike most hospital websites, Holy Cross Medical Center Taos has no dedicated "Medical Records" or "Health Information Management" page in its navigation
- **Form only available by phone/in-person**: Based on search results, patients must contact the hospital directly at (575) 758-8883 to obtain the authorization form

## Downloaded PDFs
None — no ROI form or related documents were found to download.
