## Organization
- **Name:** The Valley Hospital
- **Website:** https://www.valleyhealth.com
- **Location:** Paramus, NJ
- **Type:** Community hospital, independent, nonprofit, Northeast

## Search Strategies

1. **Web search** for `"Valley Hospital" Paramus NJ authorization release health information form PDF` — immediately found direct PDF links on valleyhealth.com and mrocorp.com.
2. **Web search** for `"Valley Hospital" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf` — confirmed the same forms and found the Home Care variant.
3. **Site-specific search** `site:valleyhealth.com medical records authorization release form` — confirmed no additional forms beyond those already found.
4. **Website navigation** — visited https://www.valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records. The page now directs patients to an online records request tool (identity verification via driver's license photo) rather than linking to downloadable PDF forms. However, the PDF files remain accessible at their direct URLs.

## Difficulties
- **No direct links on the medical records page:** The main medical records page (https://www.valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records) no longer links to downloadable authorization forms. Instead, it directs patients to an online records request tool. The PDFs are still hosted on the site but are not prominently linked.
- **Multiple entities:** Valley Health System encompasses The Valley Hospital, Valley Medical Group (VMG), and Valley Home Care, each with their own authorization form. The VMG form appears to be the most current and comprehensive.
- **MRO Corp form may be outdated:** form-3.pdf is hosted on mrocorp.com (a third-party records management company) and appears to be an older version of The Valley Hospital's form, possibly superseded by the VMG forms.
