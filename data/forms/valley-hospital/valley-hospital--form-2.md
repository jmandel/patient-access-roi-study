## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a general-purpose authorization for release of patient records and information, branded to Valley Medical Group (VMG), which is the physician group arm of Valley Health System. The footer clarifies: "*Valley Medical Group is the 'trading as' name for Valley Physician Services, PC., and Valley Physician Services, NY, PC*."

Form-2 is the **earlier version** of form-1 (dated May 4, 2023 vs. July 31, 2023). It is structurally and textually very similar to form-1 but with some differences:
- Form-1 (July 2023) adds explicit "Behavioral Health Specialist" and "Substance Use Specialist" checkboxes and significantly expands the sensitive information instructions (Section A, item 9) with sub-points a, b, and c detailing how specialist records interact with "Entire Medical Record" requests.
- Form-2 (May 2023) has a simpler sensitive information acknowledgment paragraph with no specialist-specific checkboxes and a shorter instruction #9 about psychotherapy process notes only.

Four forms were found for this organization: two VMG forms (form-1 and form-2, different revisions), one hospital-specific form hosted on MRO Corp's site (form-3), and one Valley Home Care form (form-4). Form-2 appears to be superseded by form-1 but remains accessible at its original URL.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Retrieval difficulty: moderate to hard.** The medical records page at `https://www.valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records` no longer links to downloadable PDF forms. Instead, it directs patients to an online records request tool with identity verification. The PDF remains hosted on the site at its original URL but is not discoverable through normal website navigation.

The form was found via web search queries including `"Valley Hospital" Paramus NJ authorization release health information form PDF`. The URL path (`/sites/default/files/Patient%20%26%20Visitors/Medical%20Records/...`) suggests it was once linked from the patient resources section but has been orphaned. A patient navigating the website without a search engine would not find this form.

The filename `Authorization_VMG (FINAL MAY 4 2023 with Instructions Update).pdf` contains internal revision metadata but is not patient-friendly or descriptive.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present. Full text is extractable (7,338 characters across 2 pages).
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. The form has no interactive PDF form fields despite having clearly delineated entry areas (patient name, date of birth, addresses, etc.). All fields must be completed by hand after printing.
- **File size:** 199,154 bytes (~195 KB) for 2 pages with 1 embedded image — reasonable.
- **Fonts:** 9 fonts embedded, indicating a digitally composed document (not a scan).
- **Digital-first design:** No. Despite being digitally authored (not a scan), the form is designed as a print-and-fill document. There are no fillable fields, no digital signature support, and no electronic submission instructions. The "Section B: Signatures" section requires a wet ink signature.

The form is a flat PDF intended for printing. It is not a scan, so text is accessible to screen readers and search, but the lack of any fillable fields means it cannot be completed digitally.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages — page 1 is the authorization form itself, page 2 is a detailed instruction sheet titled "Directions for Completing the Authorization to Release Information." This is a reasonable length.

**Structure:** The form uses a clear two-section structure:
- **Section A** covers patient/recipient information, delivery method, expiration, purpose, and record type selection.
- **Section B** covers signatures.
The instruction page mirrors this structure with numbered steps for each section.

**Record type selection:** The form provides approximately 18 checkbox options for record types, organized in three columns with date fields for each column: Consultation Reports, Entire medical record, Physical (H&P), Immunization Records, Laboratory Test Results, Clinical test/radiology result, Medication sheets, Medication List, Operative Report, Progress Notes, X-Ray and Imaging Reports, Psychotherapy Process Notes, Behavioral Health Encounter, Consultation Report, Pathology Report/Slides, EKG, and two "Other" fields.

**Language clarity:** Mixed. The main form is reasonably clear, but the sensitive information acknowledgment paragraph is dense:

> "I acknowledge that if any of the above checked health information contains alcohol/drug use/abuse and related treatment, genetic information, mental/behavioral health, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted disease, HIV testing, HIV/AIDS results and related information, and/or any communication or information regarding reproductive health services information, such information will be disclosed to the recipient identified above, and I consent to disclosure of such information."

This is a single 55-word sentence that bundles many sensitive categories. The instructions page (item 9) adds further detail about psychotherapy process notes requiring a separate form, but the explanation is clearer than the acknowledgment paragraph.

**Delivery method options:** The form offers five delivery methods: Fax, Paper Copy, Electronic Media (e.g., CD), Unencrypted Email, and Encrypted Email. This is a strong set of options. The default is paper: "If left blank, a paper copy will be provided."

**Expiration:** "If Date or Event not filled out, Authorization will expire 1 year after date of signing." This is clearly stated and reasonable.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a **general-purpose release form**, not specific to patient access. The instructions state: "The recipient of the health information may be someone other than the patient. It may be the patient's spouse, parent, power of attorney, another healthcare provider, etc. If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF.'" A patient requesting their own records must fill out the same form used for third-party disclosures, writing "SELF" in the recipient field.

**Scope options:** Good. Patients can specify particular record types via checkboxes, date ranges, and a named physician. The form accommodates granular requests.

**Format/delivery options:** Good. Five delivery methods are offered including both encrypted and unencrypted email and electronic media. The inclusion of encrypted email is a positive signal for patient privacy.

**Right of Access language:** The form references HIPAA generally — "I understand the terms of this Authorization are governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996" — but does not cite § 164.524 (Right of Access) or explain patient rights to access their own records. Item 5 states: "I understand that I may see and obtain a copy of the information described on this form, for a reasonable copy fee, if I ask for it," which is an indirect acknowledgment of access rights.

**EHI Export / bulk data:** No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or any modern digital access mechanisms.

**Fee disclosure:** Item 10 in the instructions states: "There may be a fee for the release of the health information you requested. If a fee applies, an invoice will be sent prior to release of the health information. Fees may be based on the number of pages that would be produced for your request." No fee schedule is provided on the form itself; patients learn about fees only after submitting. Requests are routed to "MRO Disclosure Management Solutions" (888-252-4146).

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization elements:** The form includes all required HIPAA authorization elements: description of information, persons authorized to disclose/receive, purpose, expiration, right to revoke, voluntary nature, and signature.

**Revocation:** Clearly explained with a specific mailing address: "Valley Medical Group, 15 Essex Road, Suite 506, Paramus, NJ 07652, Attn: Julia Nidetz Karcher, SVP, VHS/VMG." Must be in writing.

**Re-disclosure warning:** Present (item 4).

**No notarization required.** The form requires only a signature.

**ID requirement:** The instructions (Section B, item 3) state: "Please provide a copy of the patient's ID or the legal paperwork mentioned above, along with this request." This is presented as a request rather than an absolute requirement, but could be interpreted as mandatory.

**Fee structure:** Fees are described vaguely — "may be a fee" and "fees may be based on the number of pages." For patient access requests under HIPAA § 164.524, fees are limited to a reasonable, cost-based fee. The form does not distinguish between patient access fees and third-party release fees, nor does it cap fees or reference HIPAA's fee limitations.

**Sensitive information bundling:** The single acknowledgment paragraph bundles consent for all sensitive categories (HIV, substance use, mental health, genetic information, reproductive health, STDs, tuberculosis) into one blanket consent. There is no option to consent to some categories but not others.

**Third-party processing:** Records requests are routed through MRO Disclosure Management Solutions, a commercial records release vendor. This is disclosed but may add delay and cost that patients don't expect.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Sensitive information all-or-nothing consent:** The form bundles consent for HIV, substance use, mental health, genetic, reproductive health, STD, and tuberculosis information into a single acknowledgment with no opt-out for individual categories. A patient who wants lab results but not HIV status disclosed cannot make that distinction on this form.
- **Fee opacity for patient access requests:** The form does not differentiate between patient access requests (HIPAA-limited fees) and third-party disclosures (which may carry higher charges under state law). The vague "fees may be based on the number of pages" language, combined with routing through a commercial vendor (MRO Corp), creates risk of patients being charged more than HIPAA permits for their own records.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Superseded but still accessible:** This form (May 2023) has been superseded by form-1 (July 2023), but both remain available at their original URLs with no indication on either form that a newer version exists. A patient who finds this version via search would not know it is outdated.
- **Conflicting revision dates:** The form footer reads `Rev_May 4_2023` but the instructions page footer shows `Rev. 6/5/23` — the instructions were apparently updated a month after the main form, creating ambiguity about the authoritative revision date.
- **"Electronic Media, if available (e.g., CD)"** — the qualifier "if available" is vague about when electronic media would or would not be available.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Orphaned PDF:** The form is no longer linked from the medical records page but remains hosted at its original URL. Patients cannot find it through normal website navigation. The website now directs to an online request tool, but this PDF persists as a findable-via-search-engine artifact with no deprecation notice.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Five delivery method options including encrypted email:** Offering fax, paper, CD, unencrypted email, and encrypted email gives patients meaningful choice. The encrypted email option is uncommon and shows awareness of privacy in electronic delivery.
- **Detailed instruction page:** The full second page of step-by-step instructions for completing the form is genuinely helpful, with specific examples ("If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF'") and clear guidance on psychotherapy notes requiring a separate form.
- **Unencrypted email risk disclosure:** Item 5 in the instructions clearly explains the risks of unencrypted email delivery, giving patients informed choice rather than simply prohibiting electronic delivery.
