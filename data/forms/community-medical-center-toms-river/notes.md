# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Community Medical Center
- **Location**: Toms River, NJ
- **Website**: https://www.rwjbh.org/community-medical-center/
- **Parent System**: RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH)

## Search Strategy

1. **Web search** for "Community Medical Center Toms River NJ authorization release health information form PDF" — immediately returned the CMC medical records page on rwjbh.org.
2. **Web search** for "RWJBarnabas Health medical records release form authorization PDF" — found the system-wide Universal Release of Information form.
3. **Web search** for "site:rwjbh.org authorization release medical records form" — confirmed the Universal ROI form URL.
4. **Navigated** to the CMC medical records page at https://www.rwjbh.org/community-medical-center/patients-visitors/medical-records/ — found two CMC-specific form links and reference to a third-party online request option (Ciox/Swellbox).

## What Worked
Direct web search was highly effective. The CMC medical records page clearly links to downloadable forms and also offers an online request option through Ciox (Swellbox).

## Downloaded Forms

### form-1.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.rwjbh.org/documents/community-medical-center-/CMC-Authority-to-Disclose-Health-Information.pdf
- **Description**: "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility"
- **Pages**: 1
- **File size**: 165,175 bytes
- **Text layer**: No (image-only scan, created in Adobe Photoshop CS2, dated 2017)
- **Fillable fields**: None
- **Initial impression**: CMC-specific ROI form for releasing records FROM CMC to the patient or another recipient. This is the primary outbound release authorization form.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.rwjbh.org/documents/community-medical-center-/med-records-cmc-to.pdf
- **Description**: "Request for Release of Health Information to CMC"
- **Pages**: 1
- **File size**: 413,261 bytes
- **Text layer**: No (image-only, created via PScript5/Acrobat Distiller, originally 2015, modified 2021)
- **Fillable fields**: None
- **Initial impression**: Form for requesting release of records TO CMC (inbound records from another provider). This is the reverse direction — not a patient access ROI form but a request for outside records to be sent to CMC.

### form-3.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.rwjbh.org/documents/medical-group/Revised-Universal-Release-of-Information-Authorization-Form.pdf
- **Description**: "Universal Release of Information Authorization Form" (RWJBH system-wide)
- **Pages**: 3
- **File size**: 201,591 bytes
- **Text layer**: Yes (full text extractable, created in Microsoft Word, dated Nov 2025)
- **Fillable fields**: None (tagged PDF but no interactive form fields)
- **Initial impression**: System-wide RWJBH authorization form covering all facilities including Community Medical Center. Lists all RWJBH locations with checkboxes. More modern and comprehensive than the CMC-specific forms. Covers authorization to use/disclose protected health information.

## Difficulties
- **Forms 1 and 2 are image-only scans** — no text layer, no fillable fields, created years ago (2015-2017). Poor digital accessibility.
- **Form 2 has a rotated page** (180° rotation noted in metadata), which may cause display issues.
- No difficulties with downloading — all URLs were directly accessible without bot blocking or authentication.

## Additional Notes
- CMC also offers an **online electronic request** through Ciox/Swellbox at https://www.swellbox.com/rwjbarnabas-cmc-wizard.html (not downloaded as it's a web app, not a PDF form).
- The system-wide form (form-3) appears to be the most current document (Nov 2025) and is likely the preferred form going forward, superseding the older CMC-specific scans.
