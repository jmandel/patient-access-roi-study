# Evaluation: Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **system-wide RWJBarnabas Health "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information"** — a universal ROI form covering all RWJBH facilities, not specific to Community Medical Center. The form is 3 pages and 201,591 bytes, created in Microsoft Word with a November 2025 date, making it the most recent of the three forms retrieved for this organization.

**Relationship to other forms found:**
- **form-1.pdf** (1 page, image-only scan, 2017): CMC-specific authorization to disclose health information *from* CMC to a patient/physician/facility. This is the facility-specific outbound release form.
- **form-2.pdf** (1 page, image-only scan, 2015/2021): CMC-specific request for release of health information *to* CMC — an inbound records request, not a patient access form.
- **form-3.pdf** (this form, 3 pages, text layer, Nov 2025): The system-wide universal form that appears to supersede the older CMC-specific forms. It lists Community Medical Center as one of many RWJBH locations with checkboxes.

The URL path (`/documents/medical-group/Revised-Universal-Release-of-Information-Authorization-Form.pdf`) with the "Revised" prefix suggests this is an updated version of a prior universal form. This is the most modern and comprehensive of the three documents.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was located through a web search for "RWJBarnabas Health medical records release form authorization PDF." It was not found by navigating the CMC-specific medical records page at `rwjbh.org/community-medical-center/patients-visitors/medical-records/`, which links to the CMC-specific forms (form-1 and form-2). Instead, the URL sits under `/documents/medical-group/`, suggesting it may be primarily linked from medical group or system-level pages rather than the CMC hospital page.

A patient starting at the Community Medical Center website would likely find the older CMC-specific forms first, not this newer universal form. The form's discoverability depends on whether the patient searches at the system level or the facility level. The CMC medical records page does also reference a Ciox/Swellbox online request option, which adds another path but further fragments the experience. The URL itself is descriptive ("Revised-Universal-Release-of-Information-Authorization-Form.pdf") but long.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present and complete — 7,742 characters of extractable text. This is a significant improvement over form-1 and form-2, which are both image-only scans with no text layer.

**Fillable fields**: Zero interactive form fields despite being a digitally-created PDF (Microsoft Word origin). The form is tagged but not fillable — patients must print and hand-write entries. This is a missed opportunity given that the document was clearly created digitally, not scanned from paper.

**File format**: 201 KB for a 3-page document with 10 fonts and 1 embedded image is reasonable. The digital-first creation (Word-to-PDF) means clean text rendering, though the extensive facility checkbox grid on page 1 creates a dense layout.

**Overall**: This is a print-oriented PDF that happens to have good text extraction. It is not designed for digital completion. A patient who receives this form electronically would need to print it, fill it by hand, and return it via mail or fax.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 3 pages. Page 1 covers patient demographics, facility selection (a large checkbox grid of ~20+ RWJBH locations), recipient information, delivery method, and record types. Page 2 covers purpose, expiration, legal disclosures, and signature. Page 3 is a contact directory listing phone/fax numbers for all RWJBH HIM departments. The length is proportionate to scope, though the facility checkbox grid consumes significant page 1 real estate.

**Clarity**: The form uses a mix of plain language and legal terminology. Patient-facing instructions like "I am requesting RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) including its affiliates to release my health information to:" are clear. Legal paragraphs on page 2 are denser but reasonably understandable: "I understand that once my health information is shared as described in this form, it could be re-disclosed and may no longer be protected by federal and state confidentiality laws."

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow: identify yourself → select facility → identify recipient → choose delivery method → select records → state purpose → sign. This is a sensible sequence. Sections are visually separated with line breaks and bold headers like "Method of Delivery:" and "Information to be Released:".

**Record type options**: The form provides 15+ specific record type checkboxes including "Demographics/Proof of Stay," "Discharge Summary," "Emergency Dept Records," "Lab Reports," "Imaging Reports," "Billing Records," "Complete Medical Record," "Provider Notes," "Behavioral Health Initial Treatment Plan," plus a free-text "Other" field. It also includes a separate line for "pictures, images, video" requiring specific procedures and dates. This granularity gives patients meaningful control over what is released.

**Date range**: "Requested date range: From: ___ To: ___" allows temporal scoping.

**Sensitive information notice**: The form explicitly states that disclosed information "may include my testing, diagnosis, and treatment for ALCOHOL, DRUGS, OTHER SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER, GENETIC DISEASES AND/OR GENOMIC INDICATORS, BEHAVIORAL OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE, AIDS and HIV, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED and other INFECTIOUS DISEASES." This is rendered in all-caps, which is visually loud but ensures the patient is informed about sensitive categories.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a general authorization form, not a patient-access-specific form. The framing — "I am requesting RWJBarnabas Health... to release my health information to: [Name of Organization/Recipient]" — treats the patient as the authorizer directing release to a named third party. However, "Personal" is listed as a valid purpose (alongside "Continuing Care/Treatment," "Insurance," "Legal"), and the delivery methods include options like "Paper to be picked up (hospitals only)" and "Encrypted Email" that work for direct patient receipt. A patient requesting their own records could use this form, but it is not specifically optimized for that use case.

**Delivery method options**: Five delivery methods are offered:
1. "Paper to be picked up (hospitals only)"
2. "Paper to be sent by US Mail" (with sub-options for signature required vs. leave without signature)
3. "Encrypted Email to above email address"
4. "Other electronic format to be mutually agreed upon"
5. "MyChart"

The inclusion of encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format to be mutually agreed upon" is notably patient-friendly and suggests awareness of electronic delivery requirements. This is better than many comparable forms.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. There is no mention of regulatory timelines for fulfilling requests.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or USCDI.

**Fee transparency**: The form states: "Medical records are provided at no cost when the records are sent to another healthcare provider for patient care. For all other requests, there may be a fee to the patient/requestor. Please ask Health Information Management for more information as to the fee applicable to your request and method of delivery." This acknowledges fees exist but provides no specific amounts, directing patients to ask HIM — which requires an extra step for the patient to assess cost before committing.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: "This authorization will automatically expire in 180 days from the date of my signature below, unless I otherwise specify that this authorization will terminate on the following date, or upon the following event or condition." The 180-day default with patient override is reasonable and standard.

**Revocation**: Clear instructions provided — written notice to HIM department, effective "promptly after HIM's receipt," with the caveat that information already shared cannot be recalled. This is appropriate.

**Right to refuse**: "I understand that I can refuse to sign this form, and that my refusal will not affect the start, continuation or quality of my medical treatment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits." This is correct anti-conditioning language.

**Minor protections**: "Certain types of sensitive health information of minors between the ages of 13 and 17 will not be disclosed without the minor's authorization." This reflects New Jersey law.

**ID verification**: The "For Office Use Only" section includes "ID checked: YES / NO" with a field for ID type. While ID verification for in-person pickup is reasonable, there is no indication of what identification is required or whether this applies to all request methods.

**Fees**: The fee language is vague — "there may be a fee" with no schedule or cap referenced. For patient access requests under HIPAA, fees are limited to reasonable cost-based fees, but this distinction is not made on the form.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Five delivery methods including electronic options**: Offering encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format to be mutually agreed upon" alongside paper pickup and US Mail is substantially better than the majority of ROI forms, which typically offer only mail and fax. The "other electronic format" language is flexible enough to accommodate various patient needs.
- **Granular record type selection**: 15+ specific record type checkboxes with an "Other" free-text option give patients meaningful control over what is released, rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice.
- **Comprehensive contact directory**: Page 3 provides direct phone and fax numbers for HIM departments at every RWJBH facility, making it easy for patients to follow up regardless of which location treated them.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Patient access vs. third-party release blurring**: The form requires naming an "Organization/Recipient" to receive the records. A patient requesting records for their own use must essentially name themselves as the recipient, which is awkward and unclear — especially since the "Personal" purpose option suggests this use case is anticipated but the form structure doesn't cleanly accommodate it.
- **Fee disclosure is opaque**: "There may be a fee... Please ask Health Information Management for more information" gives the patient no way to estimate cost before submitting the form. HIPAA limits fees for patient access requests to reasonable cost-based fees, but the form does not distinguish patient access fees from third-party release fees, nor does it provide a fee schedule or cap.
- **"Other electronic format to be mutually agreed upon"**: While this is a positive offering, the phrase "mutually agreed upon" is vague — it's unclear what formats are available, how this agreement happens, or whether a patient's preferred format could be refused.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **No fillable fields despite digital creation**: The form was created in Microsoft Word and exported to PDF with 10 fonts and tagging, yet has zero interactive form fields. Adding fillable fields would have been trivial at creation time. This is a design oversight, not a technical limitation.
