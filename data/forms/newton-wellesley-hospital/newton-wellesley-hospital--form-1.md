# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — form-1.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information" branded under Mass General Brigham (MGB), the parent health system. Form number **MGB00087 (06/24)**, indicating it was revised in June 2024. The form is the current, official release form used by Newton-Wellesley Hospital and is hosted on the MGB content delivery network.

A second form (form-2.pdf) was also found — an older legacy version carrying Partners HealthCare System (PHS) branding with form number 0600938 (1/06), dating to January 2006. That legacy form is a flat PDF with zero fillable fields and references the now-defunct "Partners HealthCare" name. Form-1 is clearly the current, actively maintained version and the primary document for evaluation.

The form is a **general-purpose release/authorization form** rather than a patient-access-specific request form. It accommodates both patient-to-self requests (via "Personal" purpose and "mailed to the patient" options) and third-party releases.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Retrieval difficulty: Easy.** The form was locatable via a single web search (`Newton-Wellesley Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`). The NWH website provides a navigable path: Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records, which links to the MGB parent system's medical records page. On that page, an accordion for "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" offers downloads in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

The indirection through the parent system adds one extra step — patients must navigate from nwh.org to massgeneralbrigham.org, then expand the NWH-specific accordion — but the path is clearly signposted. The PDF URL itself (`medical-records-release-nwh-english.pdf`) is descriptive. The direct PDF link is:
`https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/content/dam/mgb-global/en/patient-care/patient-and-visitor-information/medical-records/documents/nwh/medical-records-release-nwh-english.pdf`

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

The form performs well as a digital artifact:

- **Text layer**: Full extractable text (5,223 characters across 2 pages). Not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **78 fillable form fields** — an unusually high count indicating the form was designed for on-screen completion. All checkboxes, text fields, and date inputs appear to be interactive.
- **File size**: 574,813 bytes (~575 KB) for a 2-page form — moderately large but acceptable given the high fillable field count and 11 embedded fonts.
- **Fonts**: 11 fonts embedded, suggesting professional typographic design.
- **Images**: Zero embedded images; the form is entirely text and vector-based.
- **Design origin**: This is a **digital-first** document, not a scan of a paper form. The structured layout, fillable fields, and clean text extraction confirm it was authored in a PDF creation tool.

The form includes clear mailing and fax instructions at the top: "Mail or Fax Release Form To: Release of Information, 121 Inner Belt Road, Room 240, Somerville, MA 02143-4453, Fax: 617-726-3661." A separate phone number is provided for questions (617-726-2361) and for radiology images (617-243-6071).

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure**: The form is organized into five clearly lettered sections:
- **A. Patient information** — name, DOB, MRN, address, phone
- **B. Permission to share** — source facility, purpose checkboxes, recipient info, delivery method
- **C. Information to be released** — 12 record type checkboxes, each requiring date specification
- **D. Sensitive information authorization** — 7 categories with opt-in checkboxes
- **E. Understanding and agreement** — 7 bullet points of disclosures, signature blocks

**Length**: 2 pages is proportionate for the content. The form packs substantial functionality without feeling cramped.

**Language clarity**: The form uses a mix of plain and legal language. Most instructions are clear: "Please print all information clearly in order to process your request in a timely manner." However, Section D contains dense regulatory language, particularly the 42 CFR Part 2 disclosure: "Federal rules prohibit any further disclosure of this information unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR Part 2." This is legally required but not reader-friendly.

**Instruction at top**: The header prominently displays "Mail or Fax Release Form To:" with complete address and fax details, making submission mechanics immediately clear.

**Record type granularity**: Section C offers 12 specific record categories (clinic visit notes, discharge summary, lab reports, operative reports, pathology, radiation, radiology, photographs, billing records, medical record abstract, and "Other"). Each requires date specification, which helps patients be precise but also creates a burden — patients who want "everything" must check all boxes and provide dates for each.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a general authorization form that serves both purposes. The "Personal" purpose checkbox and the option to mail records "to the patient at the above address (section A)" accommodate patient self-requests, but the form is structurally oriented toward third-party release (Section B asks "Send records to" and requires recipient name/address unless the patient checks the self-mailing box).

**Delivery method options**: The form offers four delivery methods:
1. "Mass General Brigham Patient Gateway (if available)" — the patient portal
2. "Secure Email" — with email address field
3. "Fax"
4. "Paper Copy via Mail"

The inclusion of Patient Gateway and Secure Email as delivery options is a notable strength, offering electronic delivery paths.

**Scope options**: Patients can specify record types and dates. The date requirement for each record type category is granular but may frustrate patients who don't know exactly what records exist or their dates.

**Sensitive information handling**: Section D provides opt-in consent for seven categories of specially protected information: HIV test results, genetic screening, substance use disorder records (42 CFR Part 2), mental health treatment, social work communications, domestic violence counseling, and sexual assault counseling. Each requires an affirmative "Yes" checkbox. This is legally required and well-structured.

**Right of Access language**: The form does **not** explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. It states that "This authorization is voluntary" and that treatment/payment won't be affected by refusal, but it doesn't frame the patient's request as a right.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or USCDI.

**Multilingual support**: Per the notes, the MGB page offers the form in English, Spanish, and Portuguese — a meaningful accessibility feature.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee disclosure**: The form notes "*Copying fees may apply" next to the Insurance, Legal, and Other purpose checkboxes. Notably, "Personal" and "Medical Care" purposes are **not** asterisked, implying no copying fees for patient access requests — which aligns with HIPAA's reasonable cost-based fee limitation for patient access.

**Expiration**: "This authorization will automatically expire 6 months from the date signed unless otherwise specified: __________." Six months is a standard and reasonable expiration window, and the ability to specify an alternative timeframe is a positive feature.

**Revocation**: Patients "may cancel this authorization at any time by submitting a written request to the Department or Office where I originally submitted it," with standard exceptions for actions already taken. This is compliant.

**No notarization required**: The form requires only a patient signature (or legal representative signature for minors/incapacitated patients).

**Submission methods**: Mail and fax are accepted; there is no indication of in-person-only submission requirements. The header instructions are "Mail or Fax Release Form To:" — no electronic submission option for the form itself is mentioned (though records can be delivered electronically).

**Outside records disclaimer**: Section E includes: "I understand that if Mass General Brigham maintains any of my records from outside providers, these will not be released unless I specifically ask for them under 'Other' in section C." This is worth noting — patients must explicitly request outside provider records that MGB holds, which could result in incomplete releases if patients aren't aware of this limitation.

**Pick-up identification**: The "For Internal Use Only" section at the bottom notes pick-up identification options (License, State ID, Passport, Other Photo ID), suggesting in-person pick-up is available as an additional delivery method.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **78 fillable form fields** make this form genuinely usable as a digital document — patients can complete it on-screen before printing/faxing. This is far above average.
- **Four delivery methods** including Patient Gateway (portal) and Secure Email demonstrate a commitment to electronic delivery of records.
- **Multilingual availability** (English, Spanish, Portuguese) on the MGB medical records page goes beyond minimum requirements.
- **Fee differentiation by purpose**: By asterisking only Insurance, Legal, and Other with "*Copying fees may apply" while leaving Personal and Medical Care un-asterisked, the form implicitly signals that patient access requests may not incur fees.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **"Mass General Brigham Patient Gateway (if available)"** — the parenthetical "(if available)" is undefined. It's unclear what determines availability or what happens if the patient selects this option but it's not available.
- **Date requirement for all record types**: Section C states "please check all that apply, and MUST specify dates" (emphasis in original). It's unclear whether patients who want all records from all dates can simply write "all dates" or whether specific date ranges are truly required, which could serve as a barrier for patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Outside records carve-out**: The disclaimer that records from outside providers won't be released unless specifically requested creates a potential gap. Patients may not know that MGB holds outside provider records, and the instruction to list them under "Other" with "entity name, provider, and specific dates if known" places a knowledge burden on the patient.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **"MUST specify dates"** requirement (capitalized in Section C) could function as a barrier for patients exercising their Right of Access to their complete medical record. HIPAA does not require patients to specify date ranges when requesting their records, and insisting on dates may delay or limit access.
