# Newton-Wellesley Hospital — ROI Form Retrieval Notes

## Organization Details
- **Name**: Newton-Wellesley Hospital
- **Location**: Newton, MA
- **Website**: https://www.nwh.org/
- **Parent System**: Mass General Brigham (formerly Partners HealthCare)

## Search Strategies

### What worked
1. **Web search** for `Newton-Wellesley Hospital "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` — immediately returned the direct PDF URL on the Mass General Brigham content delivery network.
2. **Navigating the NWH website** → Patients and Visitors → Billing and Records → Medical Records page (https://www.nwh.org/patients-and-visitors/billing-and-records/medical-records) — links to the parent MGB system's medical records page.
3. **MGB parent system page** (https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/patient-care/patient-visitor-information/medical-records) — has an accordion for Newton-Wellesley Hospital with English, Spanish, and Portuguese versions of the authorization form.

### Retrieval difficulty: Easy
The form was findable via a single web search. The NWH website also clearly links to it through its Medical Records page, which directs to the MGB system-wide medical records page.

### form-2.pdf
- **Source URL**: https://www.nwh.org/media/file/PHS_HIM_RELEASE-ENG.pdf
- **File size**: 102,258 bytes
- **Pages**: 2
- **Document type**: Older version of ROI / Authorization form
- **Description**: Legacy Partners HealthCare System (PHS) authorization form for release of protected or privileged health information. Older format, smaller file size. Found referenced in web search results as an alternative URL. This appears to be a predecessor version of the current MGB form.

## Difficulties
- None significant. The form was easy to find via web search and through the organization's website navigation.
- NWH's medical records page does not directly host a PDF download link — it instead links to the MGB parent system's page where users must expand the "Newton-Wellesley Hospital" accordion to find the download link.
- An older legacy form still exists at the nwh.org domain under the PHS (Partners HealthCare System) branding.
