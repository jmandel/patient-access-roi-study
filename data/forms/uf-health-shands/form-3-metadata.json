By signing this\nauthorization, I am giving permission for UF Health to release some of my PHI for a specific purpose or use as I have directed. The PHI may\ninclude information about mental health, substance and/or alcohol abuse, HIV/AIDS, and sexually transmissible diseases. This authorization\nmay be used until it expires to share the same type of PHI indicated above which may be created in the future.\nNote: If these records contain any information from previous providers or information about drug/alcohol abuse, genetic test results, HIV/AIDS\nstatus, mental health, sexually transmitted disease, or tuberculosis, you are hereby authorizing disclosure of this information.\nI understand that this authorization will remain in effect for one (1) year or until I revoke it in writing (i.e. tell UF Health to cancel it). I understand\nthat I have the right to revoke this authorization, but only to the extent that UF Health has not already taken action based on this authorization.\nI may revoke this authorization by providing a written statement to the HIM Department at the facility checked above. If I refuse to sign this\nauthorization, doing so will not affect my treatment, payment, enrollment, eligibility for benefits or the quality of care that I will receive.\nI hereby release and discharge UF Health, all of its successors and all persons acting under its permission and authority from any liability that\nmay arise from the release of PHI as I have directed. I understand that PHI shared per this authorization may no longer be protected by state\nlaw or the federal health privacy law and could be re-disclosed by the person or entity that receives it.\nI am aware that I may be charged a fee for this request as follows: Paper Copies – up to $1.00 per page (plus applicable tax and handling);\nElectronic Copies – fee associated with labor, supplies (i.e. cost of a computer disk), and postage. Additional fees apply for summary requests\nor explanations. Fees are waived when the sharing of PHI is to a health care provider for continuing treatment.\n*For purposes of this agreement, UF Health includes the University of Florida Board of Trustees for the benefit of the University of Florida\nCollege of Medicine, Shands Jacksonville Medical Center, Inc. and Shands Teaching Hospital and Clinics, Inc.\n\nSignature of patient / patient representative ____________________________________________ Date ______________\n\n*RI0001*\nRI0001\n\nAuthorization for Use or Disclosure\nof Protected Health Information\nDistribution: Original – Patient Record; Copy – Requestor\n\nFor UF Health Use Only\n\nABS\n\nDC\n\nFS\n\nPN\n\nDates of service:\n\nAN\n\nEC\n\nHP\n\nPO\n\nAU\n\nEE\n\nIM\n\nPR\n\nCC\n\nEK\n\nLA\n\nPS\n\nCircle: Mail Fax Pickup E-delivery\n\nCH\n\nEM\n\nLD\n\nPT/OT\n\nOther:\n\nCL\n\nEN\n\nOP\n\nPX\n\nCO\n\nER\n\nPF\n\nXX\n\n# pages\n\nDate\n\nChecked ID? h Yes h No\nRev. 6/20/14\n\nPS46283\n\ninitial ________\n\nTech\n\n\f",
