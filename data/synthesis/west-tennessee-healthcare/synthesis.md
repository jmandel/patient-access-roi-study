# West Tennessee Healthcare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

West Tennessee Healthcare (Jackson, TN) is a government-owned regional health system that demonstrates an above-average approach to patient record access by maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** (form-3) separate from its third-party release authorization (form-2) and an older clinic-level release form (form-1). The organization also offers an online request portal via ScanSTAT and publishes Spanish-language versions of its key forms. However, the forms themselves are not fillable PDFs, and some legacy legal language undermines the patient-centered intent.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all linked from a clearly labeled medical records page at wth.org/request-medical-records/:

- **Form-3 (primary)**: "Request for Access to Protected Health Information" — explicitly subtitled "To be used when patient wants to access their own medical record or allow a personal representative to do so." This is the most relevant form for patient self-access. It offers five delivery methods: paper, fax, CD/DVD, portal, and email (encrypted or unencrypted). Two pages, ~3,300 characters.
- **Form-2**: "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" — a third-party release authorization. One page, similar structure but without the portal delivery option.
- **Form-1**: "Medical Release Authorization" — an older (2019) form specific to the West Tennessee Medical Group Clinics. Functions as a general release for discussing care with designated individuals.

Additionally, the medical records page links to a **ScanSTAT online request portal** for hospital records, providing a fully digital alternative pathway. Spanish versions of forms 2 and 3 are also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

West Tennessee Healthcare clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release — a practice that relatively few organizations follow. Form-3 uses "request" language (appropriate for HIPAA § 164.524) rather than "authorization" language, and includes a portal delivery shortcut ("If choosing portal, please proceed to signature line. No other action needed"). The medical records webpage provides context to help patients choose the correct form. This structural distinction is a genuine bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The layout is logical — flowing from identification to delivery method to record selection to legal terms to signature — but relies on underscored blank lines and an initials-based record type selection system (15 categories). The language is moderately accessible in the patient-facing sections but becomes denser in the five legal "I understand" statements. No section headers divide the form; the structure relies on spatial layout and field labels. At two pages, the length is proportionate.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A single web search returned direct PDF links, and the medical records page is clearly labeled and well-organized. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The page provides good context about when to use each form.

## Barriers and Concerns

Two compliance issues stand out on form-3:

1. **Liability waiver**: "The facility is hereby released from any liability and the undersigned will hold the facility harmless for complying with this request." Requiring patients to waive liability to exercise their Right of Access is problematic under HIPAA.
2. **90-day expiration on an access request**: This language was carried over from the authorization form and is conceptually inappropriate — a patient access request is a one-time action, not an ongoing authorization that needs to expire.

Additional minor concerns include the driver's license requirement for non-in-person requests, SSN collection (last 4 digits), no fee disclosure, and no explicit statement of patient rights or response timeframe. The form also omits the non-conditioning statement that appears on form-2.

## Bright Spots

- **Dedicated patient access form** with clear purpose statement
- **ScanSTAT online portal** as an alternative digital pathway
- **Spanish-language versions** of both key forms
- **Multiple delivery options** including portal and encrypted email with risk disclosure
- **Easy findability** from a well-organized medical records page

## Overall Assessment

West Tennessee Healthcare shows genuine patient-centered intent by distinguishing patient access from third-party release and offering multiple pathways including an online portal. The organization loses points for non-fillable PDFs, legacy legal language (liability waiver, expiration clause), and missing rights/fee information. The structural approach is strong, but the execution — particularly the form document quality and some compliance details — keeps this from being a top-tier example. Overall, a solid B-level performance that could reach A-level with fillable fields and cleaned-up legal language.
