# Rio Grande Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rio Grande Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Del Norte, Colorado. It offers a single downloadable PDF ROI form — a generic "Authorization for Release of Information" — used across both the hospital and its affiliated clinic. Importantly, the organization also provides embedded HIPAA-compliant JotForms on both the hospital and clinic patient records pages, giving patients an online submission pathway alongside the traditional PDF.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one PDF form was retrieved: **form-1.pdf**, a one-page "Authorization for Release of Information" created in Microsoft Word 2013 and uploaded in December 2018. The same PDF is linked from both the hospital and clinic records pages. In addition, each page embeds a separate JotForm (hospital JotForm ID: 220685534838162; clinic JotForm ID: 220685679526166) for online submission, providing a digital-first alternative to the downloadable PDF. The "FOR OFFICE USE ONLY" section on the PDF also references fax and mail as delivery methods used by staff.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Rio Grande Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses classic third-party authorization framing — "I authorize ___ to disclose my individually identifiable health information" — requiring the patient to fill in both a "To" and "From" entity. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should list Rio Grande Hospital as the "From" and themselves as the "To," which is workable but unintuitive. The form does include a "Personal Use" purpose checkbox, which is the closest acknowledgment that patients may be requesting records for themselves. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access under § 164.524, and no mention of electronic health information export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Web searches quickly surfaced the hospital's patient records pages, and the PDF had a descriptive URL. The JotForms are prominently featured on the pages, while the downloadable PDF sits in the sidebar — meaning the online pathway is actually more visible than the print form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was required.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable document with zero interactive form fields. Despite being digitally created (not a scan), it uses underscored blank lines for handwriting — a print-era design. At one page, it is appropriately concise. The layout follows a logical sequence (patient identity → parties → record types → HIV authorization → purpose → legal terms → signature), but the opening authorization paragraph is a dense, multi-line sentence covering communicable diseases, mental illness, and redisclosure warnings all at once. Record type options are limited to four checkboxes (History/Physical, Lab Results, X-Ray Reports, Other Diagnostic Reports) with no option for "all records," discharge summaries, medications, or billing. The form opens with "THIS REQUEST MUST BE FILLED OUT COMPLETELY" in emphasized text — a stern tone that could discourage patients uncertain about fields like SSN.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant red flag is the **SSN collection** — the form requests Social Security Number as a standard identifier alongside name and DOB, which is unnecessary for records release and creates identity theft risk. The form also provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or reference to the online JotForm. A patient who downloads and fills the PDF has no clear next step. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeframe is stated. The form does not require notarization or a witness.

## Notable Strengths

The standout bright spot is the **online JotForm submission option**. While not part of the PDF itself, the organization provides a fully digital pathway for records requests via embedded web forms on both hospital and clinic pages. This is a meaningful investment in patient accessibility. The form's **non-conditioning language** ("I understand that my health care and the payment of my health care will not be affected if I do not sign this form") is a positive HIPAA compliance element. The **single-page format** keeps things concise. The HIV/STD/AIDS opt-in/opt-out structure with patient initials properly addresses Colorado's heightened protections for sensitive health information.

## Overall Assessment

Rio Grande Hospital provides a functional but dated records request experience. The PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with no patient-access differentiation, no fillable fields, an unnecessary SSN field, and no submission instructions. However, the organization partially compensates with its JotForm-based online submission pathway, which gives patients a digital-first alternative. The best available pathway for a patient is the online JotForm, though the PDF form — the only downloadable document — falls short of modern patient-centered design. For a small independent critical access hospital, the investment in online forms is commendable, but the underlying authorization framework remains oriented toward third-party release rather than individual access rights.
