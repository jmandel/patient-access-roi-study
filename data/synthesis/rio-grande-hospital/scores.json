    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems — the single-page format is concise and logically organized, but the dense opening paragraph, limited record-type checkboxes, stern 'MUST BE FILLED OUT COMPLETELY' header, and lack of submission instructions create clarity issues."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Patient self-access is an afterthought — the form is a generic third-party authorization with 'I authorize ___ to disclose' framing, no reference to HIPAA Right of Access, no dedicated patient access pathway, and the 'Personal Use' checkbox is the only nod to self-access."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — SSN collection is unnecessary for patient access requests and creates risk; no fee disclosure or response time commitment; but revocation language and non-conditioning statement are properly included."

      "summary": "Rio Grande Hospital provides a functional but dated records request experience with a generic third-party authorization form; the online JotForm option is a meaningful digital pathway, but the PDF form lacks fillable fields, collects SSN unnecessarily, and does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release."
