# Community Medical Center (Toms River, NJ) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Medical Center (CMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Toms River, NJ, part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. Three PDF forms were retrieved, and the organization also offers a Ciox/Swellbox online records request portal as the primary pathway for patients.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF documents were downloaded:

- **form-1.pdf** — A CMC-specific one-page "Authorization to Disclose Health Information from CMC to Patient/Physician/Facility" (2017, image-only scan, no fillable fields). This is the legacy facility-level outbound release form.
- **form-2.pdf** — A one-page "Request for Release of Health Information *to* CMC" (2015/2021, image-only scan). This is an inbound records transfer form and is **not relevant** for a patient requesting their own records.
- **form-3.pdf** — The system-wide RWJBH "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (3 pages, Nov 2025, has text layer but no fillable fields). This is the most current and comprehensive form, covering all RWJBH locations. It is the best available PDF for patient self-access.

Beyond PDF forms, the medical records page prominently features a **Ciox/Swellbox online portal** for electronic records requests. Fax (732-557-2209) and email (cmcroimedicalrecords@rwjbh.org) submission options are also available.

## Patient Access Pathway

CMC does not offer a dedicated form specifically designed for patient self-access. Both the legacy CMC form (form-1) and the system-wide form (form-3) are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to cover all release-of-information scenarios — patient access, third-party requests, insurance, legal, and continuing care. On form-3, "Personal" appears as a purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care/Treatment," "Insurance," and "Legal," but the patient must name themselves as the recipient in a field clearly designed for third-party organizations. The Swellbox online portal, however, may provide a more patient-centric experience as a purpose-built records request tool, and the organization directs patients toward it as the primary pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was straightforward. A direct web search for CMC medical records authorization returned the facility's medical records page immediately. The page links to the CMC-specific forms and references the online portal. The system-wide form (form-3) required a separate search at the RWJBH system level. No bot blocking or authentication barriers were encountered.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing form-3 (the best available PDF): the document has a text layer and clean digital rendering (created in Word, not scanned), but **lacks fillable fields** — a patient must print it and complete it by hand. The layout is well-organized with a logical flow: patient demographics → facility selection → recipient → delivery method → record types → purpose → legal terms → signature. Record type selection is granular (15+ checkboxes including behavioral health, pathology, and imaging). Page 3 provides a helpful contact directory for all RWJBH facility HIM departments. Legal text on page 2 is dense but not impenetrably so. The facility checkbox grid on page 1 is visually crowded but functional. The older CMC-specific forms (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans with zero accessibility — no text layer, no fillable fields, no screen reader support.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-3 includes anti-conditioning language ("my refusal will not affect the start, continuation or quality of my medical treatment") and clear revocation rights. No notarization or witness is required. Fee disclosure is **vague**: records are free when sent to another provider for care, but "there may be a fee" for other requests with no schedule or amounts provided. HIPAA cost-based fee limits for patient access are not mentioned. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The 180-day authorization expiration is reasonable.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods** on form-3: paper pickup, US Mail, encrypted email, MyChart, and "other electronic format" — far better than most ROI forms.
- **Online portal** (Swellbox) provides a fully digital pathway alongside PDF forms.
- **Comprehensive contact directory** (page 3) with phone and fax for every RWJBH HIM department.
- **Multiple submission channels**: fax, email, online portal, and mail.

## Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any PDF form despite digital creation.
- **Generic authorization form** — no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow.
- **Opaque fee disclosure** — patients cannot estimate costs before submitting.
- **Legacy CMC forms** (form-1, form-2) are image-only scans that remain linked on the website alongside the modern system-wide form, creating potential confusion.

## Overall Assessment

Community Medical Center earns a **B** overall. The organization benefits significantly from the Swellbox online portal and strong delivery method options on the system-wide form. The retrieval experience is easy and multiple submission channels exist. However, the PDF forms are non-fillable and generic, the fee disclosure is vague, and there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway in the PDF workflow. The coexistence of legacy image-only scans alongside a modern system-wide form reflects incomplete digital modernization.
