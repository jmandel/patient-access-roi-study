    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital with one gap — the Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital pathway, but the PDF forms (including the best one, form-3) lack fillable fields, requiring print and handwrite for the PDF route; fax and email submission are available."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — form-3 follows a logical flow with clear section headers and granular record type selection (15+ options), but legal text on page 2 is dense and the facility checkbox grid is visually crowded."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the PDF forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms where a patient must name themselves as recipient and select 'Personal' as purpose; no dedicated patient self-access form exists, though the Swellbox portal may offer a more tailored experience."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — form-3 includes anti-conditioning language and clear revocation rights, but fee disclosure is vague ('there may be a fee' with no schedule) and HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) is not referenced."
