      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Born-digital PDF with text layer is usable with annotation workarounds, and fax submission is available, but the form has zero fillable fields requiring a print-and-handwrite workflow."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate 11-section numbered structure with logical flow, but dense legal language, no plain-language summary or instructions, and cramped single-page layout create notable clarity issues."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the form by checking 'Patient Request' as the purpose, but the form is designed for third-party release — requiring the patient to fill in themselves as the recipient with no acknowledgment of individual access rights."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Broad liability waiver bundled into authorization goes beyond legal requirements; vague fee language may not distinguish HIPAA-capped patient-access fees; no Right of Access reference — though revocation rights and right to refuse are properly stated."

      "summary": "Rhode Island Hospital provides an easily findable but generic authorization form that lacks fillable fields, a patient-access-specific pathway, and electronic delivery options, placing it in the average tier despite good organization and sensitive-information protections."
