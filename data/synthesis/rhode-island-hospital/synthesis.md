# Rhode Island Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Rhode Island Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Providence, RI, is part of the Brown University Health system (formerly Lifespan). Two PDF forms were retrieved: a system-wide "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" form (form-1, updated October 2024) and a department-specific imaging-records release form (form-2, Lifespan Medical Imaging, revised February 2023). Form-1 is the primary form relevant to a patient requesting their own records from Rhode Island Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, No Patient-Specific Route

Rhode Island Hospital does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both retrieved forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information. The primary form (form-1) frames the workflow around disclosing records *to* a named recipient ("To release to:"), which is the structure of a third-party authorization — not a patient self-access request. While the form does include "Patient Request" as a purpose checkbox (Section 4), a patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in their own name as both the patient and the recipient. There is no separate form, section, or process that recognizes individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 as distinct from authorized disclosure to third parties.

The hospital does maintain a dedicated medical records request webpage at `brownhealth.org/patients-visitors/request-medical-records` with contact information, which is a helpful navigation aid. However, this page directs patients to the same generic authorization form rather than offering a simplified patient-access workflow.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the primary form, and a site-specific search confirmed the URL and identified the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or other access barriers were encountered. The PDF was directly downloadable from a public URL. This is a strong point — many organizations make form discovery far more difficult.

## Form Document Quality

**Fillability**: The primary form is a born-digital PDF with a full text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being a recently updated document (October 2024), patients must print it and complete all fields by hand. This is a missed opportunity given the form's digital origin — adding interactive fields would be trivial.

**Layout and organization**: Form-1 uses a logical 11-section numbered structure covering facility selection, recipient, dates, purpose, format, record types, exclusions, and legal terms — all compressed onto a single page. The structure is clear, but the density is high, with legal boilerplate competing for space with patient-facing fields.

**Language**: The legal sections (8–11) use standard but dense regulatory language. No plain-language summary, explanatory guidance, or patient-friendly instructions are provided. A patient without familiarity with HIPAA authorization forms would likely find the legal sections intimidating.

**Record format options**: Limited to "paper" or "CD disc" — no electronic delivery option (email, portal, secure link) is offered. This is notable for a 2024 form, especially given HIPAA's requirement to provide records in the electronic format requested if readily producible.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Broad liability waiver**: Section 9 requires patients to "release Brown University Health, its employees and my physicians from all liability arising from this disclosure of my health information." Bundling a blanket liability release into a records authorization is aggressive and may discourage patients from exercising their access rights.
- **Vague fee language**: The form notes "There may be a fee associated with this request" without specifying amounts, providing a fee schedule, or distinguishing between patient-access fees (HIPAA-capped) and third-party release fees.
- **No electronic delivery**: Offering only paper and CD in 2024 creates a barrier for patients seeking digital access.
- **Out-of-state contact numbers**: Status inquiry numbers route to Massachusetts and California area codes, suggesting outsourced ROI processing — potentially confusing for Providence-based patients.

## Notable Strengths

- **Granular record-type selection**: ~10 specific record categories plus a behavioral health subsection, with a helpful "Abstract" definition footnote, give patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.
- **Sensitive information protections**: Five categories of sensitive information (sexual abuse, mental health, STIs, substance use, HIV) can be excluded, respecting both 42 CFR Part 2 and Rhode Island state law.
- **Multi-facility coverage**: A single form covers all Brown University Health facilities with clear checkboxes, avoiding the need to locate separate forms.
- **Easy findability**: Forms are prominently available online with no access barriers.

## Overall Assessment

Rhode Island Hospital provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is easy to find and logically organized, but it funnels all patients — including those exercising their individual access rights — through a generic third-party authorization workflow. The absence of fillable fields, electronic delivery options, and a patient-access-specific pathway places it squarely in the middle of the pack. The embedded liability waiver and vague fee language are concerning, though the granular record-type options and sensitive-information protections are commendable. A patient can successfully request records, but the process was clearly designed for institutional disclosure workflows rather than patient self-service.
