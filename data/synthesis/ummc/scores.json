    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds. The Spanish form has 70 fillable fields enabling digital completion, but no submission method (fax number, email, portal) is listed on the form — a patient must separately determine how to submit."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems. Logical top-to-bottom organization and 14 record-type options, but the Patient Rights section is a dense unbroken paragraph, no submission instructions are provided, and 'View Access as scheduled' is undefined."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them. The form is a generic third-party release with 'Personal' as one purpose option; no HIPAA Right of Access reference, no dedicated patient access pathway, and the 'Release to' field creates a confusing self-referential workflow."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires. Witness signature is not mandated by HIPAA; SSN collection is unnecessary; blanket rejection of 'incomplete' forms without defining which fields are required; no fee transparency."

      "score": 2.85,
      "grade": "C",
      "summary": "UMMC provides a generic, moderately organized authorization form with bilingual availability and fillable fields, but critical findability failures, a witness requirement, SSN collection, and lack of patient access differentiation place it in the C range."
