# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, a nonprofit community hospital in Downers Grove, IL, operates under the Advocate Health system and uses system-wide forms for medical records requests. The organization distinguishes itself by maintaining a **dedicated patient self-access form** (form-4, "Patient Request for Health Information") that is clearly separated from its third-party authorization form (form-5, "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information"). This separation is a best practice that most healthcare organizations do not follow.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Seven documents were retrieved, but only four are relevant to patient medical records access:

- **Form-4** (primary): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a single-page form designed specifically for patients requesting their own records, with a "Myself" checkbox, portal callout, and five delivery method options.
- **Form-5**: "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" — the third-party disclosure authorization, a companion to form-4.
- **Form-6**: Spanish-language authorization form (corresponds to the third-party release, not the patient self-request form).
- **Form-7**: Step-by-step instructions for completing the authorization form, with a portal-first framing.

The remaining forms (form-1, form-2, form-3) are Employee Assistance Program releases or a legacy Advocate Medical Group form — none relevant to hospital patient access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocate Health earns high marks for pathway differentiation. Form-4 is explicitly titled "Patient Request for Health Information" and opens with a prominent callout: *"Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org."* The form's first recipient option is "☐ Myself." This is a clear, dedicated patient access pathway — patients are not forced through a generic third-party authorization workflow.

The organization also offers the LiveWell patient portal as an alternative digital pathway, referenced on both form-4 and the instructions document (form-7). This portal-first suggestion is a notable patient-centered design choice.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Advocate Health medical records page (advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records) clearly lists both primary forms with direct PDF download links, plus the Spanish version and instructions. No bot blocking was encountered, and all PDFs downloaded successfully. The main challenge was that the system-level organization of forms means patients searching specifically for "Good Samaritan Hospital" forms may not immediately find the centralized system page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-4, the patient self-access form, is a well-designed single-page document that fits patient demographics, 22+ record-type checkboxes (across medical records, imaging, and billing categories), delivery method options, sensitive information acknowledgment, and signature blocks into one page. The layout is logical with clear three-column organization for record types. Language is plain and accessible.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being a born-digital PDF with 8 embedded fonts and clean vector graphics. Patients must print and hand-fill, a significant missed opportunity. The form also **lacks submission instructions** — there is no mailing address, fax number, or email address telling patients where to send the completed form.

Five delivery methods are offered: paper copy by mail, CD, encrypted email, patient portal, and in-person pick-up. The inclusion of encrypted email is uncommon and welcome.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form is relatively barrier-free: no notarization, no witness requirement, no in-person-only submission mandate. Fees are mentioned vaguely ("Fees may apply") without amounts or a fee schedule reference. No response time is stated. Form-4 does not include an explicit patient rights statement, though form-5's companion rights section covers revocation, non-conditioning, and re-disclosure.

A notable gap exists for Spanish-speaking patients: the Spanish-language form (form-6) corresponds to the third-party authorization, not the patient self-request form. Spanish-speaking patients must use a more complex disclosure authorization to request their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, via its parent system, demonstrates strong patient-centeredness through its dedicated patient access form and portal-first messaging. The differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release is a model for other organizations. The form's content design is solid — concise, well-organized, and comprehensive in scope options. The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a paper workflow for the form itself), missing submission instructions, and vague fee language. The patient portal provides a digital alternative that partially compensates for the PDF's limitations. Overall, this organization provides an above-average patient experience for records access, earning a **B** grade.
