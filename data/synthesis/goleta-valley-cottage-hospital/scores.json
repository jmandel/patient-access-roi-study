      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all disclosures, not specifically for patient self-access; a patient can use it via the 'Patient (self)' checkbox but must navigate irrelevant sections (recipient relationship, redisclosure restrictions) designed for third-party release."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: No notarization, electronic signatures accepted, multiple submission channels, 15-day turnaround faster than HIPAA's 30-day requirement; minor ambiguities in fee disclosure ('there may be a fee' with no amounts) and the 'invalidation' warning, but nothing that would materially impede a patient."
