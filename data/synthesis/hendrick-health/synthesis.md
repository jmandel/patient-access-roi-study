# Hendrick Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Hendrick Health, a nonprofit regional hospital system based in Abilene, TX, provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms for records requests — one for the hospital arm (Hendrick Medical Center, including South and Brownwood campuses) and one for the outpatient clinic arm (Hendrick Clinic). Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for third-party release of information, not dedicated patient self-access request forms. No online portal, patient portal–based request workflow, or dedicated patient access form was identified.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Hendrick Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting disclosure. Both forms are titled "Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information (PHI)" and frame the transaction as a release between two named parties. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name in the "authorize" blank and again in the "who can receive" section — a workflow designed for attorneys, insurers, and other requestors, not for individual access under HIPAA § 164.524.

The forms do include "Personal Use" as one of seven disclosure reasons, which accommodates patient self-access, but it is not highlighted or explained. There is no mention of the patient's Right of Access, no fee limitation language, and no stated response timeline.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Standard web searches immediately surfaced the Medical Records page (hendrickhealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/), which links directly to both PDFs with clear descriptions. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, login wall, or browser automation was required. The URLs are descriptive and stable. This is a findability bright spot.

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1 (hospital)** is the stronger of the two forms and represents the best available pathway. It is a single-page flat PDF (zero fillable fields) with a text layer — digitally created from a Word document but exported without interactive form fields. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit via fax (325-670-6538), mail, email, or in-person pickup. The Hendrick Service Center address and contact information are pre-populated, reducing patient guesswork.

The form is organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → record type selection → sensitive record initials → reason for disclosure → legal text → party identification → signatures. Record type granularity is a strength, with 16+ specific checkboxes plus an "all health information" option. However, the legal text in the lower third is dense, small-font legalese citing Texas Health & Safety Code § 181.154(c) and 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(1). No plain-language summary of patient rights is provided.

**Form-2 (clinic)** is structurally identical but notably weaker: it omits the email delivery option, lacks pre-filled contact information (leaving patients unsure where to submit), and omits a dates-of-service field. Patients who received care at both hospital and clinic entities would need to complete two separate forms with no cross-referencing guidance.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization, witness, or in-person submission is required — these are positive absences. Fees are not mentioned at all (neither disclosed nor waived). The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is unnecessary for HIPAA-compliant record identification but is a minor rather than severe barrier.

Both forms misspell "HIPAA" as "HIPPA" — a factual error that appears in the opening paragraph and undermines credibility. Form-2's PDF metadata exposes internal document management details ("Page 2__05.2022 MASTER-Authorization to Obtain or Release PHI- - Copy.docx"), suggesting careless export. The title of form-1 ("Authorization to Release Health Information") contradicts its subtitle ("Authorization to Obtain Protected Health Information"), creating directional confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery** on the hospital form is uncommon and provides a digital delivery pathway
- **Pre-populated facility contact information** on form-1 reduces patient burden
- **Granular record selection** gives patients meaningful control over what is released
- **Single-page format** keeps the form manageable despite dense content

## Overall Assessment

Hendrick Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find and free of major barriers, but the organization channels all requestors — patients, attorneys, insurers — through the same generic authorization form without acknowledging that patient self-access is a distinct right with different rules. The flat, non-fillable PDFs represent a missed opportunity for digital-first design, and the split between hospital and clinic forms adds unnecessary complexity. A patient can get their records here without undue hardship, but the process was clearly not designed with them as the primary audience.
