# Shannon Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Shannon Health, a nonprofit regional health system in San Angelo, TX, provides a single Authorization for Release of Information (ROI) form for all records requests. The form is available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful accommodation for the area's large Hispanic population. While the form is easy to find and includes several patient-friendly features, it follows the common pattern of routing patient self-access requests through a generic third-party release authorization rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway.

## Forms & Pathways

Shannon Health offers two downloaded documents, but they are functionally one form in two languages:

- **form-1.pdf** (English): "Authorization for Release of Information," revised 06/2024
- **form-2.pdf** (Spanish): "Autorización para la Divulgación de Información," identical structure

The most relevant form for patient self-access is form-1.pdf (English). The form includes a "Self" checkbox under the recipient field and "Personal Use" among purpose options, acknowledging patient access as a use case. However, the form's structure — with fields for recipient organization, address, phone, fax, and relationship — assumes a third-party release scenario. A patient requesting their own records must navigate these irrelevant fields, with no guidance on how to handle them when "Self" is selected.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal for record requests, and no separate streamlined process for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The website's navigation path — **Patients & Visitors → Request Medical Records** — leads directly to a page with clearly labeled download links for both language versions. This is a 2-click path from the homepage. One minor friction point: web search results initially returned outdated URLs (`medical-record-authorization.pdf`) that produced 404 errors. The filenames were updated for 2025 without redirects, creating link rot. Navigating the website directly resolved this.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are underscores for handwriting; no checkboxes are interactive. For a form dated 2025, this is a significant missed opportunity. Patients must print the PDF, hand-fill all fields, then scan or photograph it for electronic submission.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → purpose → record types → substance use disorder options → format → legal terms → signature → return instructions. The flow is intuitive, and the form uses reasonably clear language, though page 2's legal disclosures are denser. The form provides granular control over record scope with approximately 15 record type checkboxes, a date range field, and hospital/clinic selection. The three-option handling of substance use disorder records (include all, exclude all, select specific) is well-designed.

Approximately 25 fields require completion, which is proportionate for a general-purpose ROI form but more than a dedicated patient access form would need.

## Barriers

**Fees**: The form states fees "may" be charged and requires the patient to "agree to pay accordingly" — without disclosing amounts or referencing applicable fee limits. This vague blanket acceptance is the most significant concern; a patient has no idea what they're agreeing to.

**No notarization or witness** required. **No in-person submission** required — email is explicitly listed as the "Preferred Method" via `ROIRequests@shannonhealth.org`. Mail and in-person delivery are also available. No fax submission is listed, but email more than compensates.

**Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) linked side-by-side on the records page — appropriate for San Angelo's demographics (~45% Hispanic)
- **Email as the preferred submission method** — unusually patient-friendly; most orgs default to fax or mail
- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: MyChart portal access and encrypted email via ShareFile, in addition to paper, CD, pick-up, and mail
- **Non-conditioning disclosure**: Explicitly states Shannon cannot condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on signing the authorization — an important HIPAA protection many forms omit
- **Substance use disorder records handling**: Three clear options giving patients granular control over sensitive information

## Overall Assessment

Shannon Health delivers an above-average but not exceptional patient experience. The form is easy to find, reasonably well-designed, and submitted through a patient-friendly email channel. The bilingual offering and electronic delivery options are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (funneling patients through a generic third-party authorization), the absence of fillable fields in a 2025-edition form, and the vague fee disclosure prevent it from reaching the top tier. A patient can successfully request their own records, but the process wasn't designed with that use case as the primary concern.
