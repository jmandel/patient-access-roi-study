    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds — the form is a digitally-authored PDF with a text layer but zero fillable fields, requiring patients to print, hand-fill, scan, and email; email submission (preferred method) provides an electronic endpoint but the completion workflow is paper-based."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — logical flow across 2 pages, clear section headers, granular record type selection (~15 checkboxes), good SUD handling, and proportionate length; minor issues include dense legal language on page 2 and ambiguous handling of recipient fields when 'Self' is selected."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form includes 'Self' and 'Personal Use' options but is fundamentally a generic third-party release authorization; patients must navigate irrelevant recipient fields, and no dedicated patient access pathway or HIPAA Right of Access citation exists."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing that would materially impede a patient — includes non-conditioning statement (uncommon positive), no notarization or witness required, email submission available; the one ambiguity is vague fee disclosure without amounts or reference to HIPAA cost-based limits."

      "summary": "Shannon Health provides an accessible, bilingual records request process with email submission as the preferred method and multiple electronic delivery options, but relies on a generic third-party authorization form without fillable fields rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway."
