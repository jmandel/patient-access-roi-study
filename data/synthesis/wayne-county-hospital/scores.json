    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,

      "score": 4,

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3: some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — the witness signature requirement has no basis in HIPAA for patient access, and the reason-for-request field appears mandatory despite HIPAA not requiring justification; partially offset by the KRS 422.317 free-copy disclosure."
