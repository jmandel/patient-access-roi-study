# Wayne County Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Wayne County Hospital is a 25-bed independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Monticello, Kentucky. The facility provides a single one-page form for patients requesting their own medical records, along with a parallel web-based HTML form that captures equivalent information online. For a small rural hospital, the availability of dual pathways — PDF and online — is notably progressive.

## Available Forms & Pathways

Only one downloadable PDF was found: **form-1.pdf**, titled "REQUEST TO REVIEW/RECEIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION." This is a patient-access-oriented form, not a generic third-party authorization. The title and structure center on patient self-access, with "self" listed first among record-ownership options (self, child, other). The hospital also offers a web-based HTML form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` that collects equivalent information and allows electronic submission — a genuinely useful alternative to the print-and-deliver workflow.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Wayne County Hospital does a better-than-average job distinguishing patient self-access from third-party release. The form is titled "Request to Review/Receive Medical Information" rather than "Authorization for Release of Information," and the patient is addressed directly as the expected user. However, the same single form is used for all requesters — self, child, or other — with no separate instructions or additional authorization requirements for third-party requests. There is no dedicated third-party release form, which means the form functions as a blended instrument, though its default orientation is clearly toward patient access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the PDF form required a targeted web search. The form lives at `/files/galleries/Medical_Records_Release.pdf` — a media library path that is not linked from any navigable page on the hospital website. The HIM department page provides a phone number but no form download link. There is no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. A patient browsing the website would likely not discover the PDF without calling HIM or using a search engine. The web-based form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` may be more discoverable through site navigation, though this was not confirmed. Retrieval difficulty is moderate — not hard, but requiring search engine assistance rather than intuitive site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The PDF is a flat, non-fillable single page. It has a text layer (not a scan) and uses only three fonts, but all fields are represented as underscore blanks — a print-and-handwrite design. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → request type and delivery method → record ownership → dates of service → specific records requested (10 checkboxes) → reason for request → identification presented → signatures. The language is plain and accessible with no legalese. One page is an appropriate length for this type of request.

Delivery options are strong: fax, email, mail, and pick-up. Email as a delivery option is uncommon at critical access hospitals and reduces barriers for rural patients who may live far from the facility.

## Barriers & Compliance Concerns

**Witness requirement:** The form includes a separate "Witness" signature line. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access requests, and this creates a meaningful barrier — a patient filling out the form at home must find a witness before submitting. This is particularly burdensome for rural and isolated patients.

**Reason for request:** The form asks patients to check a reason (Continuity of Care, Personal Interest, Insurance Claims Processing, Legal Claims Processing, Other) without indicating this is optional. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients need not justify their request.

**Submission method not specified on PDF:** The form itself does not state where or how to return it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is printed on the document. However, the existence of the web form at `/Release-of-Health-Form` provides a clear electronic submission pathway.

**Fee transparency:** The form prominently states "Based on KRS 422.317 a first copy of a patient's record will be provided free, subsequent copies may be charged." This Kentucky-law-based disclosure of free first copies is unusually transparent for a facility of this size.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dual pathway (PDF + web form):** Offering both a downloadable PDF and an online web form is exceptional for a 25-bed critical access hospital.
- **Free-copy disclosure on the form itself:** Citing KRS 422.317 about free first copies directly on the form is a bright spot few larger organizations match.
- **Email delivery option:** Including email alongside fax, mail, and pick-up is forward-thinking.
- **One-page brevity:** No unnecessary legal boilerplate — approachable and quick to complete.

## Overall Assessment

Wayne County Hospital demonstrates a patient-centered approach that exceeds expectations for its size and setting. The form is clearly designed for patient self-access, the language is plain, and the availability of an online web form and email delivery are genuine differentiators. The main weaknesses are the witness signature requirement (a real barrier with no legal basis for patient access requests), the unfindability of the PDF on the website, and the lack of fillable fields in the PDF. Despite these issues, the overall pathway is solid — a patient can submit their request electronically via the web form, receive records by email, and pay nothing for a first copy.
