# Proliance Surgeons — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Proliance Surgeons is a large, independent, for-profit physician practice group based in Seattle, WA, comprising multiple member practices (ProOrtho, Pacific Hand & Wrist Experts, Northwest Physicians Specialists/MRI, Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons, and others). Four documents were retrieved: two nearly identical outgoing ROI authorization forms (form-2 from the main site, form-4 from ProOrtho), an image-only scan of a similar form (form-1 from NPS/MRI), and an incoming records transfer form (form-3 from Pacific Rim Orthopaedic Surgeons). The main medical records page also references Datavant as an online ROI partner, though the portal was not evaluated directly.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Proliance Surgeons does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. All outgoing ROI forms (form-1, form-2, form-4) use the same generic HIPAA authorization template ("Authorization for Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S. to Use or Disclose My Health Care Information"), which is designed for third-party disclosure under § 164.508. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address as the "recipient" — an awkward workflow that conflates patient access rights (§ 164.524) with third-party authorization. The form does include an "at my request" reason checkbox, but the structure assumes disclosure to an external party. There is no mention of HIPAA Right of Access, no format/delivery preference field, and no reference to timelines or fee limitations specific to individual access.

The mention of Datavant on the medical records page suggests an online portal option exists, which would provide a more streamlined pathway, but the PDF forms themselves are the only downloadable option found.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A basic web search immediately surfaced multiple PDFs, and the main Proliance medical records page (proliancesurgeons.com/resource/medical-records/) links directly to the primary form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The main challenge is fragmentation: different member practices host their own versions of the same template, and a patient arriving at a subsidiary site (npsmri.com, proortho.com) may find a different version than the canonical one on the main site, with no cross-referencing between versions.

## Form Document Quality

The best available form for patient self-access is **form-4.pdf** (ProOrtho), which is textually identical to form-2 but was noted to have interactive checkboxes (though metadata reports 0 AcroForm fields, suggesting non-standard implementation). Both are single-page, cleanly structured documents with two clear sections: "I. My Authorization" and "II. My Rights." The language is relatively plain, written in first person ("I understand…", "I may revoke…"), and the layout is logical. Scope options are well-granulated (all records, condition-specific, date-specific, plus sensitive categories requiring explicit opt-in per Washington State law). However, neither form has true fillable text fields — patients must print and handwrite all entries. Form-2 includes a practice-specific fax number (425.820.8975) for submission; form-4 lacks any submission instructions entirely.

Form-1 is an image-only scan at 150 DPI with no text layer — completely inaccessible to screen readers and unsearchable. It represents the worst-case scenario a patient might encounter if they land on the NPS/MRI subsidiary site.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness requirement** — a positive.
- **No fees disclosed** — neutral; avoids deterrence but leaves patients uninformed.
- **No in-person requirement** — fax submission is available via form-2.
- **No electronic signature option** — requires printing and wet signature.
- **No response time stated** — patients have no expectation for turnaround.
- **Practice-specific contact info** baked into one form variant, creating confusion for patients at other Proliance locations.

## Notable Strengths

- **Concise one-page format** that covers all essential authorization elements without clutter.
- **Sensitive information categories** properly separated with individual opt-in checkboxes (HIV, mental health, STDs, substance use), compliant with Washington State RCW 70.02.
- **First-person rights language** in the "My Rights" section, which is more patient-friendly than typical third-person legal boilerplate.
- **Clear revocation instructions** with two specific methods (revocation form or letter).
- **Datavant portal mentioned** on the medical records page as an online alternative.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **Generic authorization form conflated with patient access** — no dedicated Right of Access pathway.
- **No fillable text fields** — print-and-handwrite workflow despite being a digitally-created document.
- **Fragmentation across subsidiaries** — multiple versions with inconsistent quality and no cross-referencing.
- **Form-1 is an image-only scan** — a digital accessibility failure.
- **Form-3 cites wrong state law** (California CMIA instead of Washington RCW 70.02) and wrong HIPAA year (2003 vs. 1996).

## Overall Assessment

Proliance Surgeons provides a readily findable, concise authorization form with reasonable content design and no major procedural barriers. However, the organization falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all record requests through a generic third-party authorization form with no differentiation for individual access. The print-and-handwrite workflow and subsidiary fragmentation further diminish the experience. The mention of Datavant as an online option is promising but not reflected in the downloadable forms themselves. Overall grade: **C** — adequate but not designed around patient self-access.
