      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Primarily a paper workflow — the best available form (form-2/form-4) has a text layer but zero fillable fields, requiring print, handwrite, and fax/mail submission; form-1 is an image-only scan with no text layer at all."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — clean two-section structure (My Authorization / My Rights), plain first-person language, logical flow, and good scope granularity, with only minor issues like dense expiration language and a marketing checkbox that could confuse patients."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic authorization form requires patients to designate themselves as 'recipient' with full address, offers no format/delivery preferences, and makes no reference to HIPAA Right of Access or individual access timelines."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization, no excessive fees, proper sensitive-information opt-in for Washington State law, clear revocation instructions, though the form conflates § 164.508 authorization with § 164.524 access and subsidiary form-3 cites wrong state law."

      "summary": "Proliance Surgeons provides easily findable, concise authorization forms with clean content design, but the lack of fillable fields and reliance on a generic third-party authorization form for patient self-access significantly limit the patient experience."
