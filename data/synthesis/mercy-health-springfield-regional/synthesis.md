# Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center: Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system, offers patients three distinct pathways to request medical records: **MyChart** (patient portal), **eRequest** (an online wizard powered by Swellbox/Datavant at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html), and a **downloadable paper form**. Fax (513-599-4503), email (MercyROI@datavant.com), and phone (844-835-1238) are also listed as contact channels for Springfield.

Four PDF documents were retrieved, but only two are relevant to Springfield patients. **Form-1** is from mercy.net (a separate Missouri-based Mercy system)—a false positive caused by the confusingly similar branding. **Form-2** is a Youngstown-region variant from the correct system but wrong region. **Form-3** is the system-wide authorization form currently linked on the website, but it is an **image-only scan** with only 46 characters of extractable text—functionally inaccessible to screen readers or digital filling. **Form-4** (MHP 0785 Rev 1/19) is the Springfield-specific authorization form with full text layer, but it is **not linked anywhere on the website**—it was discovered only by guessing the URL pattern (`mercy.com/-/media/.../springfield.ashx`).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. All PDF forms are titled "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information"—generic HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release. Form-4 accommodates patient self-access via a "Self" checkbox and defaults the purpose to "For Personal use if not otherwise stated," which is patient-friendly. However, the form structure, title, and legal framing are oriented toward third-party authorization. A dedicated patient access request form (like the one from the Missouri mercy.net system, ironically) does not exist within Bon Secours Mercy Health's offerings for Springfield.

The eRequest portal via Swellbox/Datavant represents a potentially more patient-centric pathway, as it is an online records request wizard that may differentiate between request types. However, only the PDF forms were directly evaluated.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the medical records page was straightforward—`mercy.com/patient-resources/medical-record-requests` is well-organized with clear pathways. However, finding the **right PDF form** for Springfield was surprisingly difficult. The linked system-wide form (form-3) is an image-only scan—a 2024 regression from the 2019 text-based regional versions. The Springfield-specific text version exists at a predictable URL but is entirely undiscoverable through normal website navigation. Additionally, web searches conflated mercy.com (Ohio) with mercy.net (Missouri), producing a false-positive form from the wrong health system.

## Form Document Quality (Form-4, the Best Available PDF)

Form-4 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a full text layer—but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it requires printing and hand-filling. The layout is logical: patient demographics → facility selection → date range → record types (11 checkboxes) → recipient → format → delivery → legal disclosures → signature. The top half is clear and well-organized; the bottom half compresses six dense legal bullet points into small paragraphs with complex language ("Treatment, Operations or Payment disclosures to insurance companies when the law gives the right to the insurers to contest a claim under policy"). The form cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and offers four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email) with electronic format (PDF/CD) as the default—an uncommon patient-friendly choice.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable concerns emerge. First, **"Photo ID required at the time of request"** is stated in the header with no guidance on how this applies to fax or mail submissions, creating ambiguity that could deter remote requests. Second, **"Entire record (standard two years of information, unless otherwise specified)"** imposes a default time limitation that patients may not notice, potentially resulting in incomplete records when HIPAA's Right of Access covers the entire designated record set. Fee language is vague: "There may be a charge for copies of records" with no amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee distinction. No notarization is required, and multiple electronic submission methods are available (fax, email).

## Notable Strengths

The organization offers a genuinely multi-channel approach: MyChart, Swellbox/Datavant eRequest portal, and paper form with fax/email/mail submission. The electronic format default, personal-use default purpose, explicit § 164.524 reference, and MyChart delivery option are all bright spots. The form is available in English only—no multilingual versions were found for Springfield.

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Springfield Regional Medical Center provides an **adequate but fragmented** patient records request experience. The eRequest portal and MyChart offer digital pathways, but the downloadable form—the fallback option—suffers from critical problems: the linked version is an image-only scan, the better text version is hidden, no forms have fillable fields, and the form itself is a generic third-party authorization rather than a dedicated patient access instrument. The result is a C-grade experience where digitally-savvy patients who find the portal do fine, but patients seeking a traditional form encounter unnecessary friction.
