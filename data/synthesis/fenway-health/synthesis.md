# Fenway Health — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Fenway Health, an independent nonprofit FQHC in Boston, MA, provides a cohesive three-document records-release package: an English ROI authorization form (form-1), a companion FAQ guide (form-2), and a Spanish translation of the ROI form (form-3). The forms are easy to find, submission channels are plentiful, and the organization demonstrates genuine care for its patient population through thoughtful design choices — but it does not offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway, instead routing all records requests through a generic third-party authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

The primary form is titled "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information" and is structured around a FROM/TO model: "I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM: Sender/Facility's name... TO: Recipient/Facility's name." This framing is designed for provider-to-provider transfers — a patient wanting their own records must write their personal name and address into the "Recipient/Facility's name" field, which is unintuitive. There is no checkbox for "send records to me" and no separate patient access form. The organization does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization.

Fenway Health also offers MyChart patient portal access, which provides a separate digital pathway, but the downloadable form itself is firmly a generic authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Fenway Health's forms was straightforward — a simple web search immediately returned the PDF URL and the dedicated medical records page at fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was needed. The organization maintains a clean, dedicated medical records landing page with clear submission instructions. This is a best-case retrieval scenario.

## Form Document Quality

The English form (form-1) is a single-page, born-digital PDF with a clean text layer and 7 fonts — clearly designed with care in a layout tool. However, it contains zero fillable fields, which is a significant missed opportunity. Despite being digitally created, patients must print, hand-fill, and then scan or fax the form. The layout follows a logical 7-section flow (patient info → sender → recipient → reason → record type → sensitive info → signature) and fits on one page, though the density is notable. The legal notice in Section 7 is a single 130-word block mixing authorization scope, revocation rights, reproductive health protections, and substance abuse protections — challenging to parse.

Section 6 (Sensitive Information) stands out: it requires individual patient initials for 10 categories of sensitive health information, including abortion care, gender-affirming care, HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, and substance use treatment. This granularity gives patients unusually fine-grained control over disclosure.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fenway Health imposes no unreasonable barriers. There is no notarization requirement, no in-person mandate, and no fees mentioned. Submission channels include mail, fax, email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org), and MyChart portal — four pathways, all adequate for remote submission. The form clearly states revocation rights and a one-year authorization validity period. Processing time is noted as up to 21 days (in the FAQ sheet), well within HIPAA's 30-day requirement. The sensitive information initials requirement, while thorough, could function as a processing delay trigger if patients skip it — the bold warning "COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING" has a somewhat coercive tone.

## Notable Strengths

Fenway Health's standout feature is the companion FAQ sheet (form-2) — a 3-page plain-language guide that walks patients through every section of the ROI form, defining terms like "bi-directional" and "abstract" that would otherwise be opaque. Very few healthcare organizations create separate instructional documents for their ROI forms. The Spanish-language form (form-3) demonstrates commitment to language access, though no Spanish FAQ exists. The inclusion of Massachusetts-specific shield-law language protecting reproductive health and gender-affirming care records reflects both legal compliance and organizational mission. The "Name used (if different)" field thoughtfully accommodates patients whose current name differs from their legal name.

## Weaknesses

The most significant weakness is the absence of a dedicated patient access pathway. The FROM/TO structure is designed for third-party release and does not clearly serve a patient requesting their own records. The lack of fillable fields on a born-digital PDF is a technical oversight that forces an unnecessary print-handwrite-scan workflow. The Spanish form's contact block reverts to English ("Mail/Fax to:", "Attn: Medical Records Dept"), undermining the translation effort.

## Overall Assessment

Fenway Health earns a solid B. The organization demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness through its FAQ guide, multilingual forms, and sensitive information protections, but falls short on the two key assessment dimensions: it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, and its form is not digitally fillable despite being born-digital. A patient can successfully request their records through this process, but the form was not designed with that use case as a first-class concern.
