    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds; fax submission available — the born-digital PDF has zero fillable fields, forcing a print-handwrite-scan workflow, but fax, email, and portal submission channels are available."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — single-page form with logical 7-section flow and a companion FAQ guide, though the legal notice paragraph is dense and the sensitive-info initials section has a coercive tone."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the FROM/TO structure assumes facility-to-facility transfer, and a patient requesting their own records must figure out how to repurpose the generic authorization form."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization, no in-person requirement, clear revocation rights, 42 CFR Part 2 cited, but no explicit statement of patient access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 and no fee disclosure."
