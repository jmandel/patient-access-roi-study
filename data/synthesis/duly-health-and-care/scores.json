      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the form by selecting 'Personal Reasons' but the form was not designed for patient self-access — it conflates patient access with third-party release, applies the same witness and fee requirements to all requests, and does not acknowledge the patient's distinct Right of Access."

      "score": 3,
