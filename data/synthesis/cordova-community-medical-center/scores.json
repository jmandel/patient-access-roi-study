      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Primarily a paper workflow — the PDF has zero fillable fields, requiring patients to print, handwrite, and fax; though fax submission is available, the form itself is entirely non-interactive."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but with notable problems — the numbered structure and record-type granularity are good, but later sections shift into dense legalese, the single page is visually cramped, and the sensitive-info clause is confusingly worded."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Patient self-access is an afterthought — the form is framed entirely around third-party release, requiring patients to awkwardly write their own name as recipient, with no dedicated pathway, no delivery format field, and no statement of patient access rights."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — the all-or-nothing sensitive information bundling is problematic under 42 CFR Part 2, the 164.524 citation is misapplied, and there is no statement of access rights or turnaround time, though no outright violations exist."
