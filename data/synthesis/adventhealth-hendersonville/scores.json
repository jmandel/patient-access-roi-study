    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 5,
      "rationale": "Level 5: Fully functional digital workflow — the primary pathway is a Swellbox/Datavant online wizard that allows form completion and submission entirely online, with no printing or handwriting required."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but with notable gaps — the medical records web page provides clear contact info, but the facility has no downloadable form of its own; the sister-facility form (form-1) is well-organized with plain language but is non-fillable and belongs to a different facility; the Swellbox wizard's internal content could not be assessed."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Patient access is clearly accommodated — the medical records page explicitly addresses patient records requests and provides an online portal, though it does not visibly differentiate patient self-access from third-party release at the page level."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities — no unnecessary barriers exist (online, fax, and phone submission available, no notarization), but fee information is absent from the facility's own pages and sister-facility forms request partial SSN unnecessarily."

      "score": 3.95,
      "grade": "B",
      "summary": "AdventHealth Hendersonville provides a modern portal-based records request pathway through Swellbox/Datavant with good electronic accessibility, but the lack of facility-specific PDF forms and moderate findability through a shared system-wide page prevent a top-tier rating."
