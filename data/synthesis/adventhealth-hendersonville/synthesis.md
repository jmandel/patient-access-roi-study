# AdventHealth Hendersonville — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

AdventHealth Hendersonville is a community hospital in western North Carolina, part of the AdventHealth major nonprofit health system. The facility's primary pathway for medical records requests is a **Swellbox/Datavant online eRequest wizard**, linked from a shared system-wide medical records page. No downloadable PDF form specific to AdventHealth Hendersonville exists. The three PDF forms retrieved during the search all belong to other AdventHealth facilities — two from St. Luke's Hospital in Columbus, NC (~40 miles away) and one from Florida Hospital Heartland Division in Sebring, FL.

## Access Pathway Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville's medical records page (accessible via a footer link on the facility homepage) provides phone, fax, and online eRequest options under the "Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina Locations" tab. The **Swellbox/Datavant wizard** at `swellbox.com/adventhealth-mid-wizard.html` is the primary digital pathway for all records requests. This is an online portal approach — a fully digital request workflow that does not require printing, handwriting, or physically delivering a form.

The facility does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release at the form discovery level; the Swellbox wizard is the single channel for all request types. Whether the wizard itself differentiates internally is unknown from the available materials. Among the sister-facility PDF forms found, form-1 (St. Luke's "Patient Request for Access") does explicitly separate patient self-access from third-party release — but this form is not linked from AdventHealth Hendersonville's pages and belongs to a different facility.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms for AdventHealth Hendersonville required **moderate effort**. The medical records page was findable through standard website navigation (footer link), and the Swellbox wizard URL was clearly listed. However, multiple web searches for downloadable PDF forms returned only results from sister facilities, and URL-guessing for Hendersonville-specific PDFs returned 404 errors. The shared system-wide medical records page, with its tabbed regional structure, adds a layer of navigation complexity — a patient must identify the correct regional tab and locate their facility within it. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Since no Hendersonville-specific PDF form exists, the best available PDF for assessment is **form-1 (St. Luke's Patient Request for Access)** — a sister facility form from the same Western NC region. This is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) that must be printed and filled by hand. It has a logical top-to-bottom flow covering patient identification, scope selection, format preferences, and delivery method. The language is plain and patient-friendly ("If you would like a copy of your medical record, please complete the form below"). It offers excellent format options (CD, flash drive, email, paper) and delivery methods (mail, secure email, fax, pickup).

However, the form is dated **June 2016**, still uses pre-rebrand "St. Luke's Hospital" branding, includes the Columbus, NC address, and explicitly states "I am a patient of St. Luke's Hospital." A Hendersonville patient using this form would be submitting a request to the wrong facility.

The primary pathway — the Swellbox wizard — is likely a more functional and appropriate tool for Hendersonville patients, but as an external third-party portal, its internal quality could not be assessed from the downloaded materials.

## Barriers

- **No notarization or witness** required on the sister-facility forms.
- **Fees**: Not mentioned on form-1; form-2 states "A fee may be charged" without specifying amounts; form-3 mentions fees may apply. No fee schedule was found.
- **SSN collection**: Forms request last 4 digits of SSN (form-1 and form-2) or full SSN (form-3), which is unnecessary for patient access.
- **Submission methods**: The Swellbox wizard provides fully online submission. Fax (828-651-4018) and phone (828-681-2135) are also available. No indication that in-person delivery is required.

## Notable Strengths

- **Online portal pathway**: The Swellbox/Datavant wizard offers a fully digital workflow — no printing, scanning, or faxing required.
- **Multiple contact channels**: Phone, fax, and online options are all clearly listed.
- **Sister facility form quality**: Form-1, though not Hendersonville-specific, demonstrates that AdventHealth's regional forms can be well-designed with good format/delivery options.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No facility-specific PDF form**: A patient who prefers or needs a downloadable form has no Hendersonville-specific option.
- **Wrong-facility forms in search results**: PDF forms from other AdventHealth facilities appear in searches, creating confusion risk.
- **Outdated sister-facility forms**: The available PDFs are 7-10 years old with pre-rebrand branding.
- **System-wide page complexity**: The shared medical records page requires patients to navigate regional tabs to find their facility.

## Overall Assessment

AdventHealth Hendersonville provides an adequate-to-good patient records request experience through its Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, which represents a modern, portal-based approach. The facility scores well on having an electronic submission pathway and multiple contact options. However, the absence of any facility-specific downloadable form, combined with confusing sister-facility PDFs in search results and a somewhat complex system-wide navigation structure, prevents a top-tier rating. The organization's approach is portal-first by design, which works well for digitally comfortable patients but offers no paper-form fallback specific to this facility.
