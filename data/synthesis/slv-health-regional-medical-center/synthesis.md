# San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center — Synthesis

## Overview

San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center (SLV Health-RMC) is a nonprofit community hospital in Alamosa, Colorado, part of the San Luis Valley Health regional system that also includes Conejos County Hospital (La Jara). The organization makes three PDF forms available online: a current English-language authorization form (form-1), a superseded 2013 English version (form-2, still publicly accessible but no longer linked), and a Spanish-language translation (form-3). All three are generic "Authorization to Release Medical Record Information" forms — none is designed specifically for patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Access Pathway

SLV Health does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. All three forms use a "RELEASE FROM" / "RELEASE TO" structure designed for authorizing disclosure to a named recipient — an attorney, insurer, or other provider. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves in the "RELEASE TO" field, which is workable but unintuitive. There is no checkbox, pathway, or language acknowledging that a patient might simply want to access their own health information. No patient portal or online request wizard is offered for records requests.

The primary pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, then email the completed form to `MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org` or mail it to the facility. The email submission option is a meaningful convenience that prevents the need for in-person delivery.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **very easy**. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links, and the organization's Medical Records page (`/patient-center/medical-records/`) clearly links to both the English and Spanish authorization forms. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only concern is that the older form-2 remains publicly accessible at its original URL and could surface in search results, potentially confusing patients about which version to use.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally created PDF with extractable text — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are visual underlines meant for handwriting, and there is a "Patient Sticker" area intended for in-facility paper workflows. The form cannot be completed electronically within the PDF itself. This is clearly a print-oriented document.

The layout is dense but logically organized, flowing from facility identification through patient info, record type selection (six categories with initial-based checkboxes), expiration options, sensitive-condition authorization, and signature block. The language is moderately legalistic but generally understandable — the authorization statement is reasonably clear. Section headers provide hierarchy, though the initial-based checkbox convention `( )` requires familiarity.

The form lacks instructions or guidance text, offers no statement of patient rights, and makes no reference to HIPAA, turnaround times, or fees.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests Social Security Numbers as a standard identification field alongside name and date of birth — unnecessary for a records release authorization and creating identity theft risk. This is particularly concerning given the community's demographics.

The vague disclaimer **"San Luis Valley Health is not responsible if lost"** is poorly worded and could deter patients from submitting forms remotely. The **copies clause** (MAY/MAY NOT be used with same effectiveness as original) places an opaque legal decision on patients. A persistent **spelling error** ("INFORMATION REQUIRIED") has survived at least two revision cycles, suggesting limited quality control.

No notarization is required. No in-person submission is required. No fees are disclosed — neither their presence nor absence is mentioned.

## Bright Spots

The **Spanish-language form** is a genuine strength. It is co-located with the English version on the Medical Records page, requiring no extra navigation — appropriate and commendable for a community hospital serving the San Luis Valley's significant Latino population. The **email submission option** lowers the barrier compared to fax-only or mail-only processes. The **single-page design** is efficient, and the **granular record-type options** give patients meaningful control over scope.

## Overall Assessment

SLV Health-RMC earns credit for easy findability, bilingual support, and email submission — things many organizations fail to provide. However, the lack of a patient-specific access pathway, absence of fillable fields, SSN collection, and missing rights information keep this solidly in the middle tier. A patient can navigate the process, but the organization hasn't designed it with patient self-access in mind. The form serves its historical purpose as a generic release authorization; it has not evolved to meet the expectations of a patient-centered digital healthcare landscape. **Grade: C.**
