# Gritman Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Gritman Medical Center is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Moscow, Idaho. The organization provides a single general-purpose "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form for all records requests. There is no patient portal–based request option and no dedicated patient access form — patients requesting their own records use the same document as those authorizing release to a third party.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page fillable PDF titled "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (revised 4/1/2024). This form serves both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios, with "RELEASE TO" and "RELEASE FROM" sections on the same document. There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), and no patient portal–based request pathway.

The form is linked from the "My Health Records" page on Gritman's website, reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → My Health Records). A web search also surfaces the form quickly. Findability is strong for a small rural hospital.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Gritman does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as a generic HIPAA authorization — a patient requesting their own records fills out the same "RELEASE TO" / "RELEASE FROM" fields as someone authorizing release to an attorney or insurer. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of the 30-day response requirement, and no guidance distinguishing the patient's stronger legal protections for self-access. The "Purpose" checkboxes include "Personal" as an option, which is the closest the form comes to acknowledging patient self-access, but it carries no special treatment.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **63 fillable fields**, meaning patients can complete it digitally before printing or submitting. It is a single page with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient information, release parties, delivery method, purpose, treatment dates, information types, authorization language, and signature. The layout is compact but organized, with clear section headers.

Language is a mix of plain English and moderate legal terminology. The "I UNDERSTAND THAT" section is dense but covers the key compliance elements (revocation, re-disclosure, non-conditioning). The sensitive-information disclosure statement is appropriately specific, listing behavioral health, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing, sickle cell anemia, and substance abuse.

The form offers **five delivery methods**: standard mail, fax, email, pickup, and certified mail. Email availability is a meaningful bright spot — uncommon among small rural facilities. Submission method is less clear: the form header lists a phone number and fax number but does not explicitly instruct patients on how to return the completed form. Patients could reasonably fax it to the listed number.

Field names are absent from the fillable fields, creating an accessibility gap for screen readers. The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Barriers

- **Fees**: The form notes "Continuation of Care (no fee)" for that purpose, implying fees for other purposes including personal requests, but provides no fee schedule or cost estimate. Certified mail carries an unquantified "Add'l Charge."
- **No notarization or witness** required — just patient/guardian signature.
- **No in-person requirement** stated; the fax number in the header provides a reasonable electronic submission pathway.
- **90-day auto-expiration** with a one-year maximum is reasonable.
- **Submission instructions are absent**: No explicit guidance on how to return the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery option** — unusual for a critical access hospital and valuable for rural patients who may live far from the facility.
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific report type checkboxes give patients fine-grained control.
- **"Major Documents for the Last 3 Years"** shortcut — a thoughtful option for patients who don't know exact treatment dates.
- **Recently revised (4/1/2024)** — evidence of active form maintenance.
- **63 fillable fields** — a genuinely interactive PDF, not a flat scan.

## Overall Assessment

Gritman Medical Center provides a competent, recently updated, fillable ROI form that is easy to find and reasonably well designed. Its main weakness is the lack of differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — patients are funneled through a generic authorization form that doesn't acknowledge their stronger rights under HIPAA's individual access provisions. Fee transparency is also lacking for personal-use requests. Despite these gaps, the form's fillable fields, email delivery option, and granular record selection make it a serviceable tool for a patient requesting their own records. For a small independent critical access hospital, this represents a solid but not exceptional effort.
