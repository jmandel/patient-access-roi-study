    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the form but it wasn't designed for them — no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release, no reference to HIPAA Right of Access, and 'Personal' is just one of several purpose checkboxes."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
