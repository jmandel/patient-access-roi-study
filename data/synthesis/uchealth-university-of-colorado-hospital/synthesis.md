# UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, part of the UCHealth system in Aurora, Colorado, provides a solid pathway for patients requesting their own medical records. The organization's medical records page is well-organized, directly links to the current authorization form, and offers an online request portal (MRO Express) as an alternative. Four PDFs were downloaded during retrieval, but only two are genuinely relevant: the current system-wide authorization form (form-4) and an older 2017-era predecessor (form-1). A third form (form-2) is a legacy inter-facility transfer document, and the fourth (form-3) belongs to an entirely different organization — UC Health Cincinnati — retrieved due to domain confusion between uchealth.org (Colorado) and uchealth.com (Cincinnati).

## Access Pathway: Generic Form with Strong Patient Accommodation

UCHealth does not offer a dedicated patient-access-only form. The current form (form-4, document #HIM19000.1025, revised October 2025) is a generic "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it accommodates patient self-access unusually well. The form includes an explicit "If released to self, select method of release" section with four delivery options: email, My Health Connection (patient portal), mail, and PowerShare (for radiology images). The fee schedule is split clearly between patient access (free via portal, free paper up to 100 pages, first radiology disc free) and third-party recipients (retrieval fee plus per-page charges). This dual fee structure is a standout practice — few organizations make this distinction so transparently on the form itself.

The organization also offers MRO Express, an online request portal, as an alternative to the downloadable PDF. This portal provides a fully digital pathway, though our evaluation focused on the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form was straightforward. UCHealth's medical records page (`uchealth.org/access-my-health-connection/medical-records-uchealth/`) was reachable within 1–2 clicks from the main website and clearly presented the download link, online portal option, and location-specific contact information. The only complication was domain confusion: a web search returned a form from UC Health Cincinnati (uchealth.com), which could mislead patients searching generically for "UCHealth" forms. Two older forms (2017 and 2018 vintages) also remain publicly hosted at their original URLs with no indication they are superseded, creating a minor stale-link hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-4) is a single-page, digitally generated PDF with a clean text layer — not a scan. Despite its digital-native construction, it has **zero fillable form fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand. This is a notable gap: the older form-2 (a legacy inter-facility document) actually had 54 fillable fields, demonstrating that UCHealth has the technical capacity for interactive PDFs but did not apply it to the current form.

The layout is logical — flowing from facility selection through patient demographics, purpose, recipient, date range, record types, disclosures, fees, and signature — but extremely dense. Approximately 28 record-type checkboxes, a full fee schedule, six numbered disclosure statements, a reproductive healthcare warning, and a confidentiality notice are all compressed onto a single page. The form helpfully defines "Visit record" vs. "Visit summary" in parenthetical notes, aiding patient comprehension. Language across the disclosures is plain and accessible, covering right to revoke, voluntary nature, no conditioning on treatment, and re-disclosure risks. The form does not include submission instructions (no address, fax number, or email for where to send it), though this information is presumably on the medical records web page.

## Barriers and Bright Spots

UCHealth imposes no significant barriers: no notarization, no SSN request (a problem on the older form-2, now corrected), no mandatory in-person submission, and no conditioning of treatment on signing. The patient fee structure — free portal delivery and free paper up to 100 pages — is among the most generous observed. A notable bright spot is the reproductive healthcare warning (item 6), alerting patients that released reproductive health information could be used in litigation — a post-*Dobbs* addition reflecting emerging privacy concerns. Sensitive record categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, genetic, sickle cell, reproductive health) each require separate patient consent, providing granular control.

The primary weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (requiring print-and-fill), the absence of submission instructions on the form itself, and the failure to state a processing time commitment (the older form-1 promised 10 business days). The form is English-only with no multilingual version available.

## Overall Assessment

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital earns a solid **B** grade. The organization makes its form easy to find, provides an online portal alternative, clearly accommodates patient self-access with separate delivery options and fee structures, and maintains strong compliance posture. The main shortcomings are the non-fillable PDF format and the dense single-page design. With fillable fields and submission instructions added to the form, this would approach best-in-class.
