    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital with one gap — the org offers an MRO Express online portal for fully digital submission and fax is available, but the primary PDF form has zero fillable fields, requiring print-and-handwrite."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor issues — logical top-to-bottom flow, plain language, helpful record-type definitions, but extremely dense single-page layout and no submission instructions on the form itself."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Patient access is clearly accommodated within a multi-purpose form — explicit 'If released to self' section with four delivery options, separate patient fee schedule (free), and MRO Express portal, though no dedicated patient-only access form exists."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing material — free patient access, clear rights statements, no unnecessary barriers, reproductive healthcare warning; however, no processing time commitment is stated and the '100+ pages sent electronically' policy is ambiguous."

      "summary": "UCHealth provides a well-organized, easy-to-find authorization form that clearly accommodates patient self-access with free delivery options and strong compliance, but the non-fillable PDF format and missing submission instructions prevent a top-tier rating."
