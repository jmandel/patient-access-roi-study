# UPMC Presbyterian — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

UPMC Presbyterian uses the system-wide UPMC "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" form (form-1.pdf), a two-page PDF hosted on UPMC's Digital Asset Management CDN. Two additional documents were found: an In-Home Urgent Care variant (form-2.pdf) for home-based care services, and an informational guide (form-3.pdf) that walks patients through completing the main form. The primary form relevant to a patient at UPMC Presbyterian requesting their own hospital records is form-1.pdf.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UPMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to physicians, insurers, attorneys, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same form used for third-party release, selecting "Personal Use" as the purpose and listing themselves as the recipient. However, UPMC does include a notable inline annotation: **"Purpose is not required for patient access,"** a clear acknowledgment of HIPAA individual access rights that most organizations omit. This partially bridges the gap, but the form's structure — "I authorize UPMC to release information to: [Facility/Person to Receive Records]" — remains fundamentally oriented toward release to third parties. There is no separate patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a MyChart-based records request workflow in the materials reviewed.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Web searches immediately returned direct PDF links on UPMC's CDN. The form is prominently linked from both the system-wide medical records page and the UPMC Presbyterian-specific sub-page. No bot blocking, broken links, or login requirements were encountered. This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form is a **born-digital but print-first PDF**. Despite being created digitally (22 embedded fonts, not a scan), it has essentially no fillable fields — only 1 unnamed interactive field was detected across the entire document. All data entry points use underscore-style blank lines and checkbox squares intended for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it by hand, and submit it via mail or fax.

The form is **extremely dense**. Page 1 packs facility selection (14+ UPMC hospitals), patient demographics, recipient information, purpose, disclosure format, delivery method, record type selection (20+ specific document types), sensitive-information opt-outs, expiration terms, and signature blocks onto a single page. While the logical flow is sound (sections labeled A through C), the tight spacing and small text create a visually overwhelming experience. Page 2 contains patient rights and responsibilities disclosures.

The language mixes plain English with legal terminology. Instructions like "Parts 1 and 2 below must be completed" are clear, but fee language and re-disclosure warnings are dense. The 20+ record-type checkboxes offer impressive granularity but may overwhelm patients who simply want "all my records."

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **Fee language is ambiguous for patient access.** The form states "charges may be associated with this request" citing Pennsylvania state law, without distinguishing patient access (subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based limits) from third-party requests. The phrase "records will be sent upon receipt of payment" could be read as conditioning access on pre-payment.
- **90-day default authorization expiration** is unusually short and may force resubmission if processing is slow, though patients can specify up to one year.
- **No fillable fields** despite born-digital creation is a missed opportunity that forces a paper workflow.
- **Fax delivery restricted to "Providers Only"** — patients cannot receive records by fax, though email and Direct Address are available as electronic delivery alternatives.

## Notable Strengths

- **Companion instruction guide** (form-3.pdf) is a rare patient-friendly resource that explains each section with plain-language examples (e.g., "Inpatient: Admitted for treatment or surgery with overnight stay in hospital").
- **"Purpose is not required for patient access"** — an unusually clear inline acknowledgment of HIPAA rights.
- **Email and Direct Address delivery options** demonstrate awareness of digital access preferences.
- **Anti-conditioning statement** explicitly states UPMC will not condition treatment on signing.
- **Oral authorization provision** for patients physically unable to sign, with two-witness requirements.

## Overall Assessment

UPMC Presbyterian provides an accessible, findable ROI form with some genuinely patient-friendly features — particularly the companion guide and the "purpose not required" note. However, the organization funnels all record requests through a single generic authorization form that was designed for third-party release, lacks interactive form fields despite being born-digital, and uses ambiguous fee language that doesn't clearly distinguish patient access rights. The result is a process that a motivated patient can navigate but that was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. For a major academic health system, the lack of any digital-first submission pathway (online portal, fillable PDF, or web form) is a notable gap.
