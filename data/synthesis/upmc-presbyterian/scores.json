    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Primarily a paper workflow — despite being born-digital, the form has essentially no fillable fields (1 unnamed field detected), requiring patients to print, handwrite all ~20 data points, and submit physically; no online submission portal exists."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems — the logical section structure (A-B-C) and companion instruction guide are positives, but page 1 is extremely dense with 20+ record-type checkboxes, tight spacing, and mixed plain/legal language that could overwhelm patients."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form is a generic third-party release authorization with no dedicated patient access pathway, though the 'Purpose is not required for patient access' note and 'Personal Use' option partially accommodate self-access."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements or language that may go beyond what the law requires — fee language citing PA state law doesn't distinguish patient access fees from third-party fees, 'records will be sent upon receipt of payment' may conflict with HIPAA's timely access requirement, and the 90-day default expiration is unnecessarily restrictive."

      "summary": "UPMC Presbyterian provides an easy-to-find generic ROI form with some patient-friendly features (companion guide, purpose-not-required note) but is held back by a non-fillable paper workflow, no dedicated patient access pathway, and ambiguous fee language."
