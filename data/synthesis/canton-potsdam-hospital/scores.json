      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — the form includes good baseline compliance (voluntariness, revocation, non-conditioning) but collects SSN unnecessarily, provides no fee transparency on the form, and offers no differentiated patient access rights process."
