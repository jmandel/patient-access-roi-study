      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital workflow — the current Swellbox online portal provides a fully digital submission path, but the only downloadable form documents (historical PDFs) have zero fillable fields and would require print-and-handwrite; fax was available as electronic submission."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but with notable problems — the historical form-1 has a logical single-page layout with reasonable record-type options, but language is semi-legal, there are no explicit instructions, and SSN is unnecessarily collected."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Patient access is clearly accommodated — the current website routes patient self-requests to a dedicated Swellbox wizard separate from third-party channels, though the historical PDF forms were generic ROI authorization forms not designed specifically for patient access."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
