# Baptist Health Lexington — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Baptist Health Lexington is a community hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, part of the Baptist Health (Kentucky) system. It does not maintain facility-specific medical records request forms; instead, it relies on system-wide forms published by the parent system at baptisthealth.com. Three documents were retrieved, all system-level.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found:

1. **Form 1 (Primary):** "Authorization for Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — the current system-wide authorization form, revised February 2026. A 3-page, dual-purpose document covering both patient self-access ("Myself" checkbox) and third-party release ("Other person/organization" checkbox). Includes delivery method options (paper, fax, email, CD, MyChart), record type packages, sensitive information consent, and a helpful "Tips" page. Submission is via fax or mail to a centralized Release of Information office in Louisville.

2. **Form 2:** "Request for Medical Records" — a simpler, 1-page patient-access-specific form hosted on the MyChart portal (mychart.baptist-health.org). Explicitly framed for patients requesting their own records. Dated July 2019, making it nearly seven years old. Notably, it contains no submission instructions — no address, fax number, or email.

3. **Form 3:** An older, undated version of the same system-wide authorization (Form 1). Two pages, still publicly accessible alongside the 2026 version at a non-versioned URL, creating potential patient confusion.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Baptist Health demonstrates partial differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (Form 1) is a generic HIPAA authorization, but it clearly labels a "Myself" option on its first page and notes that purpose of release is "not required if being disclosed directly to patient." A dedicated patient access form (Form 2) does exist but is outdated and lacks submission instructions, making it less useful in practice. The primary pathway a patient would encounter — through the medical records page at baptisthealth.com — is the generic authorization form with a patient self-access checkbox.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Basic web searches and the organization's medical records page led directly to downloadable PDFs. No bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The only friction is that a patient searching specifically for "Baptist Health Lexington" must recognize that the parent system's form applies. The coexistence of old and new form versions at similar URLs is a minor navigational hazard.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (Form 1) is digitally authored with a text layer and clean typography, but has **zero fillable fields**. All entry areas are blank lines and non-interactive checkbox graphics requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is well-organized with clear section headers (Patient Info, Release To / Delivery Method, Purpose, Information to Release) and a logical top-to-bottom flow. The record type "Package" system (Key Documentation vs. All Documentation) with detailed descriptions is genuinely helpful. The third page ("Tips for Requesting Medical Record Copies") provides useful practical guidance including a 15-calendar-day turnaround goal, MyChart default delivery, and contact information.

Language is mostly plain on page 1 but dense with required legal text on page 2 — HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder (42 CFR Part 2), revocation rights, and re-disclosure warnings. The sensitive information consent is bundled as an all-or-nothing authorization with no opt-out for individual categories.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Not fillable:** Despite being digitally created, no forms offer interactive fields — a significant missed opportunity.
- **SSN collection:** The last 4 digits of SSN are requested without being marked optional, exceeding what HIPAA requires for patient identification.
- **Sensitive information bundling:** The authorization bundles consent for mental health, HIV/AIDS, and substance use disorder records with no ability to exclude specific categories.
- **Outdated form still live:** Form 3 (undated older version) remains publicly accessible and could lead patients to use a superseded form with a potentially incorrect mailing address.
- **No fees mentioned:** While appropriate for patient access under HIPAA, the absence of any fee information leaves patients uncertain about costs.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart as default delivery:** If no delivery method is specified, records default to the patient's Baptist Health MyChart account — a patient-friendly, electronic-first approach.
- **Package-based record selection:** The tiered Package 1/Package 2 system with clear descriptions simplifies an inherently complex choice.
- **Toll-free phone support:** Contact information includes both local and toll-free numbers, plus a dedicated MyChart support line.
- **15-day turnaround goal:** Proactively commits to a faster-than-required timeline (HIPAA allows 30 days).
- **Multiple delivery options:** Paper, fax, email, CD, and MyChart cover a wide range of patient preferences.

## Overall Assessment

Baptist Health Lexington, through its parent system, provides a competent but conventional records request process. The primary form is well-organized and clearly accommodates patient self-access, but the reliance on a non-fillable PDF and fax/mail submission keeps this firmly in the traditional paper-workflow category. The existence of a dedicated patient access form (Form 2) shows awareness of the distinction, but its outdated status and missing submission instructions undercut its value. The bright spots — MyChart default delivery, helpful tips page, and clear package descriptions — demonstrate patient-centered thinking within the constraints of a legacy form design.
