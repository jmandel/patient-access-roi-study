      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Form has a text layer (not a scan) and could be annotated with PDF editor workarounds, and fax submission is available. However, zero fillable fields means the workflow is fundamentally print-and-handwrite before faxing."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with clear section headers, logical flow, helpful package descriptions, and a practical tips page. Minor issues with dense legal text on page 2 and bundled sensitive information consent prevent a 5."

      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Patient access is clearly accommodated via a prominent 'Myself' checkbox, purpose field waived for patient self-requests, MyChart default delivery, and a dedicated (if outdated) patient access form exists. Not a 5 because the primary form is still a generic authorization, not purpose-built for patient self-access."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: No notarization required, voluntary authorization statement present, revocation rights clearly explained, 15-day turnaround goal stated. Minor ambiguities: SSN collection not marked optional, sensitive info bundled without granular opt-out, no fee disclosure."
