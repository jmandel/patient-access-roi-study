# Massachusetts General Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), part of the Mass General Brigham system (formerly Partners HealthCare), provides a single general-purpose authorization form for all records release requests. Three versions of this form were found at different URLs, representing the form's evolution from 2016 through 2024. The current version (form-1.pdf, MGB00087 06/24) is the clear best-available pathway for a patient requesting their own records.

## Forms and Pathways

All three downloaded documents are versions of the same form — "Authorization for Release of Protected or Privileged Health Information." The current version is hosted on the parent system domain (massgeneralbrigham.org), while two older versions persist at legacy URLs on massgeneral.org. There is no dedicated patient access request form, online portal, or web-based request wizard. The sole pathway is downloading the PDF, completing it, and submitting via mail or fax.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MGH does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The same authorization form serves patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient selects "Personal" from the purpose checkboxes and checks a box to have records mailed to their own address. The form references HIPAA authorization requirements (§ 164.508) but never mentions the patient's Right of Access under § 164.524. This means a patient requesting their own records navigates a process designed primarily for third-party disclosure — workable, but not patient-centric.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, CAPTCHAs, or login requirements. The main concern is that two superseded versions remain publicly accessible at legacy URLs, creating a risk that patients could download an outdated, non-fillable version. The current form lives on the parent system domain rather than massgeneral.org, which could confuse patients who start at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-1.pdf) is technically well-executed. It is a 2-page digitally native PDF with **78 fillable interactive fields** — a significant upgrade from the older versions, which had zero fillable fields. The form follows a clear A–E section structure: patient information, permission to share, information to be released, sensitive information consent, and terms/signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and logical flow.

Language is moderately plain — straightforward instructions at the top, clear section labels, and accessible phrasing in most areas. The required regulatory language in Section D (42 CFR Part 2 for substance use records) is necessarily dense but presented legibly. Section E's terms are written in clear, formal prose with important patient protections stated explicitly ("This authorization is voluntary"; treatment will not be conditioned on signing).

The form offers four delivery methods for receiving records: Patient Gateway (patient portal), secure email, fax, and paper mail — giving patients genuine electronic options for record receipt. However, submission of the form itself is limited to mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No electronic form submission**: Despite 78 fillable fields enabling digital completion, the form must be printed and mailed or faxed. Fax is an adequate electronic pathway per study criteria, so this is not a major penalty, but the gap between fillable fields and fax-only submission is a missed opportunity.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form notes "Copying fees may apply" for Insurance, Legal, and Other purposes. Personal and Medical Care are not asterisked, implying no fees — but this is never stated affirmatively. HIPAA limits fees for patient access, and this distinction deserves explicit clarification.
- **Mandatory date specification**: Patients "MUST specify dates" for every record type requested, with no "all records" option. This could burden patients seeking comprehensive access.
- **Stale versions at legacy URLs**: Two outdated, non-fillable versions remain publicly accessible, creating confusion risk.

## Notable Strengths

- **Fillable PDF with comprehensive field coverage** (78 fields) — active investment in digital accessibility
- **Four electronic delivery options** including patient portal and secure email
- **Granular sensitive-information consent** with seven separate opt-in categories (HIV, genetics, substance use, mental health, social work, domestic violence, sexual assault)
- **Clear non-coercion statement** and voluntary authorization language
- **No notarization or witness required**
- **Version-controlled form** with clear identifiers (MGB00087 06/24)

## Overall Assessment

MGH provides a competent, well-structured authorization form with strong technical execution (fillable fields, electronic delivery options) but falls short on patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form. The form is easy to find, clearly organized, and free of major barriers. The primary gaps are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, ambiguous fee language, and the persistence of outdated form versions online. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process was designed for institutional release workflows rather than individual access rights.
