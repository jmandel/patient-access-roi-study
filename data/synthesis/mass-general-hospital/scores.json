      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process by selecting 'Personal' and checking the self-mail box, but the form was designed for third-party release — no Right of Access language, no dedicated patient pathway, and patients must navigate which parts apply to them."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
