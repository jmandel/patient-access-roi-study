# Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital is a community hospital in Fairfield, Ohio, part of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system. Medical records requests are managed centrally through the parent system's website at mercy.com, which provides a dedicated medical records request page covering all Mercy Health facilities. The hospital is listed as a checkbox option on the Cincinnati-region authorization form, with a dedicated fax number (513-599-4491).

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two PDF forms were downloaded. **Form-1** is an older Cincinnati-region "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information" (MHP 0786 Rev 1/19) with a full text layer and 5,192 characters of extractable text. **Form-2** is a newer system-wide version of the same form (printed 2024-01-17), but it is an image-only scan with only 46 characters of metadata — a significant regression in digital accessibility. Form-2 is the version currently linked from the medical records page; form-1's URL still works but is no longer prominently linked.

Beyond PDF forms, Mercy Health offers **MyChart** (patient portal) and an **online eRequest system** through Ciox/Datavant (Swellbox) at swellbox.com/mercy-health-wizard.html, providing genuinely electronic alternatives. A **Spanish-language** version of the authorization form is also available.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for all release-of-information purposes, not dedicated patient access forms. However, the form does accommodate patient self-access reasonably well: **"Self" is the first checkbox** in the recipient section, and the default purpose is "For Personal use if not otherwise stated." The form explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 (the individual right of access provision). While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, patient self-access is clearly a recognized use case rather than an afterthought.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A simple web search immediately returned the Mercy Health medical records page. The centralized page is well-organized with facility-specific fax numbers, links to forms (English and Spanish), and information about MyChart and eRequest options. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing the best available PDF form (form-1, the text-layer version): it is a **single-page**, well-organized form with a logical flow from patient demographics through facility selection, date range, record types, recipient, delivery method, purpose, and legal disclosures. The form offers granular record-type checkboxes (10 specific categories plus "Other" and "Entire record") and four delivery methods (mail, fax, MyChart, secure email). Format defaults to electronic (PDF/CD) if unspecified.

However, neither form has **fillable fields** — both require printing and handwriting. Form-1 at least has a proper text layer making it searchable and compatible with assistive technology. Form-2, the currently linked version, is a flat scan that is completely inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be filled digitally at all. The replacement of a functional digital PDF with an image scan is a notable regression.

## Barriers

- **Photo ID required**: The form states "Photo ID required at the time of request," which could exclude patients without government-issued identification.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "There may be a charge for copies of records" provides no specific amounts or fee schedule.
- **"Standard two years" default**: The "Entire record" option defaults to two years of information unless otherwise specified — patients expecting their full history may receive only a subset.
- No notarization or witness requirement. No in-person-only submission — fax, mail, MyChart, and secure email are available.

## Notable Strengths

- Multiple request pathways including MyChart and Swellbox/Datavant online portal
- Spanish-language form available
- "Self" as the first recipient option; electronic format as default
- Explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation
- Single-page form design
- Centralized, easy-to-navigate medical records page

## Overall Assessment

Mercy Health - Fairfield Hospital provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The availability of MyChart and the Swellbox online portal significantly elevates the digital pathway beyond the PDF forms alone. The PDF forms themselves are adequate in content design but limited by the lack of fillable fields, and the current primary linked form (an image scan) represents a troubling accessibility regression. The generic HIPAA authorization approach — while clearly accommodating patient self-access — falls short of a dedicated patient access pathway. The overall experience is functional but not exemplary.
