      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds — the primary linked PDF is an image-only scan requiring print-and-handwrite, but fax submission is available and the Swellbox online portal provides an alternative digital pathway; neither PDF form has fillable fields."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — single-page form with logical flow, granular record-type checkboxes, and clear instructions, though the legal disclosure section is densely packed and the 'standard two years' default could confuse patients."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic HIPAA authorization form serves both patient self-access and third-party release without differentiation, though 'Self' as the first recipient option and personal-use default partially mitigate this."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing that would materially impede a patient — includes clear revocation rights and voluntary authorization language, but the photo ID requirement and vague fee disclosure ('there may be a charge') are minor concerns."
