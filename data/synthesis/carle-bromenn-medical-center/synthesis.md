# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Three PDF forms were found for Carle BroMenn Medical Center, a community hospital in Normal, IL that is part of the Carle Health regional system:

1. **form-1.pdf** — The primary general ROI authorization form specific to the BroMenn/Normal campus (form code X3833-0820). One page. Covers Carle West Physician Group, Carle BroMenn Medical Center, and Carle Eureka Hospital.
2. **form-2.pdf** — A nearly identical system-level Carle Health ROI form for the Champaign campus (form code 174-0319). One page. Same structure but branded for the main Carle campus HIM department.
3. **form-3.pdf** — A behavioral health–specific authorization form for the BroMenn campus (form code X3852-0620). Two pages. Required separately for mental health records per Illinois law.

**Form-1 is the most relevant document** for a patient at Carle BroMenn Medical Center requesting their own general medical records. Form-2 serves the Champaign campus and would likely confuse a BroMenn patient. Form-3 is a companion form needed only for behavioral health records.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Carle BroMenn does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. All three forms are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" documents designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release scenarios. The form uses "To Send to" / "To Request from" framing, requiring patients to navigate a form designed for inter-provider transfers, legal disclosures, and insurance requests. There is no streamlined form or process specifically for a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

That said, the form does include some patient-oriented elements: delivery via MyCarle Account (the patient portal), an explicit citation of CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access regulation), and a clear statement that signing is not required for treatment.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches surfaced direct PDF download links on carle.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or multi-step navigation was required. The carle.org medical records page links to the forms. All three were directly downloadable via curl. The only minor friction: a patient might encounter both form-1 (BroMenn-specific) and form-2 (Champaign-specific) without clear guidance on which to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **digitally-authored but non-fillable PDF**. Despite being created digitally (not a scan), it has zero interactive form fields — every field must be filled by hand after printing. This is a significant missed opportunity. The form is well-organized with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of release → delivery method → record type selection → legal terms → signature. The granular record-type checkbox grid (30+ categories across hospitalization and clinic columns) gives patients meaningful control over scope. However, the single-page design makes the form cramped, with small font (estimated 8–9pt for legal text) and limited write-in space.

The language is a mix of clear and legalistic. Legal disclaimers are reasonably comprehensible but dense. The "ATTENTION: This is a legal document" warning is somewhat intimidating. There is no plain-language summary.

## Barriers

- **Purpose of disclosure required**: The form requires patients to state why they want their records — a requirement that is potentially non-compliant with HIPAA's Right of Access, which prohibits requiring a reason for patient self-access requests.
- **SSN field not marked optional**: Asks for last 4 digits of SSN without indicating it can be left blank.
- **Paper-only workflow**: No fillable fields, no fax number for submission, no email submission. A patient must print, handwrite, and mail the form or deliver it in person.
- **Behavioral health witness requirement**: Form-3 requires a witness signature for both the authorization and revocation — a barrier not required by HIPAA.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: States "there may be a charge" with no amounts. Form-3 mentions ScanStat as the third-party vendor processing requests.
- **No notarization required** — a positive.
- **No in-person submission required** — mail is an option.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyCarle Account electronic delivery** for records (30-day window) provides a digital delivery pathway even though the request itself is paper-based.
- **Explicit HIPAA citation** (CFR 164.524) — uncommon and commendable transparency about patient rights.
- **Granular record-type selection** gives patients fine-grained control over what is released.
- **Easy online findability** of forms with direct download links.
- **Appropriate behavioral health protections** including 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language and age-appropriate consent (12+ for mental health).

## Overall Assessment

Carle BroMenn Medical Center provides a functional but dated records request process. The forms are easy to find and reasonably well-organized, but the lack of fillable fields, absence of electronic submission options, and generic authorization design that doesn't differentiate patient self-access from third-party release hold it back. The purpose-of-disclosure requirement is a compliance concern for patient access requests. The organization earns credit for MyCarle Account delivery, explicit rights citations, and granular scope controls, but the fundamentally paper-based workflow and generic form design place it in the middle of the pack for patient-centeredness.
