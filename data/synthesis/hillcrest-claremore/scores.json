    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital with one gap — the org offers Swellbox online portal and MyChart for electronic submission, but the downloadable paper form has zero fillable fields despite being digitally created."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems — logical layout and clear facility selection, but dense legalistic 'I understand' section, no 'all records' option, run-on sentences in sensitive-information paragraph, and vestigial carbon-copy duplicate pages."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — generic third-party authorization form lists patient access as one purpose among many, with no reference to Right of Access or § 164.524, though portal alternatives exist."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements beyond what the law requires — blanket liability waiver bundled into authorization, vague fee disclosure with no schedule, bundled sensitive-information consent with no opt-out, though anti-conditioning and revocation language are present."

      "summary": "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore benefits from its parent system's multi-channel infrastructure (portal, MyChart, paper form) and easy findability, but the paper form is a non-fillable generic authorization with legalistic language, a liability waiver, and no patient access differentiation."
