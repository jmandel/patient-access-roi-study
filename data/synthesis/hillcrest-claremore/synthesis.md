# Hillcrest Hospital Claremore — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore is part of the Hillcrest HealthCare System (Ardent Health Services), and all medical records requests are handled through the parent system's centralized infrastructure. Two PDFs were downloaded during research, but only one is relevant: **form-2.pdf** is the system-wide "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (HMC1072, Rev. 08/18), which lists Hillcrest Hospital Claremore among nine facilities via checkboxes. Form-1.pdf belongs to an entirely unrelated practice — Hillcrest Internal Medicine in San Diego, CA — and was a false-positive search result retained per study protocol.

Beyond the paper form, the system's Medical Records Request page advertises two digital pathways: **MyChart** (patient portal) and a **Swellbox** online request wizard (hosted at swellbox.com/ardenthealth-hillcrest-wizard.html). The paper form is thus the weakest of three available channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** clearly differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The paper form is a generic HIPAA authorization covering both disclosure *to* and receipt *from* third parties in a single document. It includes "At the request of the patient or patient's representative" as one purpose checkbox among Insurance, Continued treatment, Legal, and Other — framing patient access as merely one use case rather than a distinct right. The form makes no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

However, the availability of the Swellbox online wizard suggests the system may have a more patient-centric digital pathway. The paper form alone is clearly designed for the traditional release-of-information workflow, not individual access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search led directly to the system-wide Medical Records Request page at hillcrest.com/policies-and-disclosures/medical-records-request/, reachable in 2–3 clicks from the main website. The page clearly presents multiple pathways (MyChart, Swellbox, paper form). One minor friction point: direct searches for "Hillcrest Hospital Claremore" specifically did not surface the form — a patient must navigate through or discover the parent system's centralized page.

## Form Document Quality

The paper form (form-2.pdf) is a **digitally created PDF with zero fillable fields**, forcing patients to print and handwrite all entries. This is a missed opportunity — the form was created digitally but not made interactive. The document is effectively one page of content duplicated as a carbon-copy format (page 1 for the facility, page 2 for the patient), a vestige of physical paper workflows.

The layout follows a logical flow: facility selection → patient identification → authorization body → record types → purpose → legal disclosures → signature. However, the "I understand" section is a dense block of legalistic text with minimal visual separation. Record type options are clinically specific (H&P, Discharge Summary, Operative Report, etc.) with no "all records" or "entire medical record" checkbox. The checkbox characters extract as Khmer script (U+17A2), indicating a font-mapping issue that breaks assistive technology.

The language is **moderately legalistic**, particularly the sensitive-information acknowledgment paragraph, which is a single run-on sentence listing communicable diseases.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release the entities listed above, their agents and employees from any liability" as a condition of authorizing disclosure — not required by HIPAA and a red flag.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: "Normal applicable fees, such as copy fees, may apply" with no schedule or estimate.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no mailing address, fax number, or other submission method — patients must figure out delivery independently.
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: Patients cannot authorize general records release while excluding mental health, HIV, or substance abuse information.
- **No notarization** or witness requirement — a positive.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple request pathways**: The system offers MyChart, Swellbox online wizard, and a paper form — patients have choices.
- **System-wide form clarity**: The facility checkbox design clearly identifies which entities are covered, preventing confusion about facility-specific forms.
- **Easy findability**: The centralized Medical Records Request page is well-organized and accessible.

## Overall Assessment

Hillcrest Hospital Claremore benefits from its parent system's multi-channel approach to records requests, with digital options (MyChart and Swellbox) supplementing the paper form. However, the paper form itself — the only downloadable document — is a generic third-party authorization with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, legalistic language, and a problematic liability waiver. The organization earns credit for pathway availability and findability, but the form document quality and lack of patient access differentiation hold it back. A patient who only finds the paper form faces a distinctly paper-era experience; a patient who discovers the online pathways has a better route. Overall: **adequate infrastructure, mediocre form document, no patient-access differentiation**.
