# University Medical Center of Southern Nevada — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC) is a government-owned, independent community hospital in Las Vegas. Three documents were retrieved: two versions of the same PHI Release Authorization form (a current 2019 version and a superseded 2016 version) and a Request for Amendment form. The primary form for patient self-access is the 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Centric

UMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting one's own records is a generic "Protected Health Information (PHI) Release Authorization" form — the same form used for third-party disclosures to attorneys, insurers, and other providers. The form includes a "Patient (self)" checkbox under the recipient section, which adapts it for self-access use, but the framing remains third-party-oriented: "I authorize the following facility(ies) to release my Protected Health Information." A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access must navigate the same full authorization form as someone authorizing release to a third party, including selecting a "purpose" (Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Care) — a requirement that HIPAA does not impose on individual access requests.

## Findability: A Significant Gap

The most striking finding is a disconnect between the website and the ROI form. UMC's Medical Records page (`umcsn.com/patients-visitors/patient-information/medical-records-and-birth-certificate-process`) links only to the Request for Amendment form — it does **not** link to the PHI Release Authorization that patients need to request copies of their records. The ROI form is only discoverable via web search or by knowing the direct URL. Compounding this, the superseded 2016 version remains hosted at an active URL with no indication it is obsolete, meaning patients could unknowingly submit the wrong version. This is a serious findability failure for a core patient rights document.

## Form Document Quality

The 2019 PHI Release Authorization (form-1.pdf) is a two-page, digitally-composed PDF with a proper text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being created digitally (9 fonts, 3 embedded images), it offers no interactive form fields. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and then determine how to submit it.

The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → facility selection → record type selection → sensitive information consent → recipient → purpose/format → legal statements → signature. The structure is reasonable, but institutional conventions undermine usability. The header instruction "PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" assumes clinical context meaningless to a patient at home. An unexplained barcode-like code ("*ROIRCD*") appears at the top. The header states "Page 1 of 1" on what is actually a 2-page document.

Language is mostly clear but formal. The sensitive information section deserves credit for its granular, well-explained approach — five categories (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, psychotherapy, genetic records) each with individual Yes/No consent and required initials.

## Submission: A Critical Omission

The ROI form specifies how records will be *delivered* to the patient (mail, fax, email, CD-ROM, pick-up) but does **not** state how to *submit the completed authorization*. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or portal URL appears on the form for submission. The only address on the form is for written revocation. By contrast, the amendment form (form-3) provides four clear submission channels: mail, walk-in, fax (702-207-8330), and email (HIMManagementAnalysts@umcsn.com). A patient would need to locate this information independently — likely from the Medical Records page that paradoxically doesn't link to the ROI form.

## Barriers and Compliance

UMC avoids several common barriers: no notarization is required, Social Security Number is explicitly marked as optional, and the form includes good rights language (voluntariness, non-conditioning of treatment, right to revoke). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "subject to reproduction fees in accordance with federal / state regulations" — without specifying amounts or noting that fees for patient self-access are limited by law. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions found.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular sensitive information controls**: Five-category consent with individual opt-in/opt-out is better than most ROI forms
- **Email as a delivery option**: Listed alongside mail, fax, CD-ROM, and pick-up
- **SS# marked optional**: Explicit labeling that many forms omit
- **"Patient (self)" checkbox**: Acknowledges patient self-access as a use case

## Overall Assessment

UMC provides a functional but poorly surfaced records request process. The form itself is adequate — clearly structured with good sensitive-information handling and reasonable rights language. But the patient experience is undermined by three compounding failures: the form isn't linked from the obvious website location, it isn't fillable despite being digitally composed, and it doesn't tell patients how to submit it. A patient navigating UMC's website in the expected way would find the amendment form but not the release authorization form. The organization treats records release as an institutional process that patients happen to participate in, rather than as a patient right that deserves a dedicated, discoverable pathway.
