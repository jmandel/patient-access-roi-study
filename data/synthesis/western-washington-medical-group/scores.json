    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital with one gap — the form has 39 fillable fields for complete digital completion, but submission requires fax, mail, or email rather than an integrated online workflow."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — single-page layout with logical flow, plain language, and strong scope options, but submission instructions are indirect (requires visiting a separate webpage) and the 'ALL' scope label is misleading."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form is a generic third-party release authorization where patients must select 'Personal (to patient)' as one checkbox among attorney, insurance, and provider purposes, with no dedicated patient access pathway or rights education."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization or in-person requirements, anti-conditioning statement present, but vague '*service fee may apply' language for patient access and no specific right-of-access citation."

      "summary": "WWMG provides a technically well-crafted, easy-to-find fillable authorization form, but funnels patients through a generic third-party release process rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway."
