# Western Washington Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Western Washington Medical Group (WWMG) is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Everett, WA. Three ROI-related documents were retrieved: a primary organization-wide fillable authorization form (form-1), a GI department-specific non-fillable release form (form-2), and a generic unbranded authorization hosted on PatientPop (form-3). Form-1 is clearly the most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records and is the basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WWMG does not offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The primary form (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Western Washington Medical Group to RELEASE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION" — a standard third-party release authorization. Patients requesting their own records use the same form as those authorizing release to an attorney, insurer, or another provider. "Personal (to patient)" appears as one of several purpose checkboxes, annotated with "*service fee may apply." There is no separate patient access request form, no online portal, and no patient portal option for record requests. The form does not reference the HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish individual access rights from third-party authorization. A patient must navigate a form designed around sending records to someone else and adapt it for self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-specific search returned direct PDF links, and WWMG maintains a dedicated Medical Records Request page (wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request/) that links to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or portal requirements were encountered. The URL is descriptive and the form is also listed on the Patient Intake and Registration Forms page. The only complication is the existence of three forms — a patient could potentially encounter the inferior GI-specific (form-2) or orphaned PatientPop form (form-3) instead of the primary one, though the website clearly surfaces form-1.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely well-crafted document. It is a single-page fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — well above average for healthcare ROI forms. The layout follows a logical flow: patient identification → recipient → record scope → sensitive information exclusions → purpose → expiration → signature. The language is relatively plain, with direct instructions like "PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE." The scope options are strong, offering four ways to define what records are released (all within 3 years, specific condition, specific dates, or mutual exchange). The sensitive information exclusion section gives patients granular control over HIV, STD, psychiatric, and substance abuse records using an opt-out model with required initials.

The form is not a scan — it was designed digitally with clean text, multiple fonts, and embedded branding. At 143 KB for a single page, it is appropriately sized. WWMG's address is pre-filled, reducing patient burden.

## Submission and Delivery

The form directs patients to "visit wwmedgroup.com/medical-records-request and refer to the contact info on the chart" for submission instructions, rather than listing submission options directly on the form. The "OFFICE USE ONLY" section indicates records can be faxed, mailed, or emailed — confirming electronic submission pathways exist. This indirect approach adds a step but avoids restricting patients to in-person delivery. Fax availability means patients can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or witness signature is required. However, two issues stand out:

1. **Vague fee language**: The "*service fee may apply" note next to "Personal (to patient)" is concerning. HIPAA limits fees for patient access to reasonable, cost-based amounts, and this language provides no specifics, potentially discouraging patients or leading to overcharging.

2. **Misleading "ALL" scope**: The "ALL healthcare information" option is silently limited to the last 3 years. A patient seeking their complete history must use the "Specific DATES" option, but this limitation is not explained. The word "ALL" is misleading.

The 90-day default authorization expiration is adequate for patient access requests (HIPAA requires fulfillment within 30 days with one extension) but creates unnecessary re-authorization burden for ongoing provider exchanges. A conflicting 1-year expiration for the "mutual exchange" option adds confusion.

## Notable Strengths

- Fillable PDF with 39 interactive fields — genuinely digital-first design
- Single-page format that fits all necessary elements concisely
- Strong scope options with granular sensitive-information exclusion controls
- Multi-clinic awareness field routing requests to the correct WWMG location
- Easy-to-find forms with a dedicated Medical Records Request page

## Overall Assessment

WWMG provides a technically competent, well-designed authorization form that is easy to find and fill out digitally. However, it does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release — patients must navigate a generic authorization form and select the "Personal" purpose checkbox. The vague fee language for patient access is a compliance concern. The form's document quality and digital-first design are above average, but the lack of a patient-centered access pathway keeps this from being an exemplary practice.
