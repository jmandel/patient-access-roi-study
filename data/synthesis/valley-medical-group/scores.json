    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds — the PDF itself has zero fillable fields (print-and-fill only), but MediCopy offers a HelloSign online form alternative and fax/email delivery options, providing a workable digital pathway despite the PDF's limitations."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor issues — the single-page form uses conversational headers, logical flow, and granular record-type selection, but lacks submission instructions and the Spanish translation contains notable errors ('lanzado' for 'released')."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic release form requires patients to fill in their own info as both patient and recipient, with 'Personal Use' as just one of several purpose options and no mention of HIPAA Right of Access."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — unnecessary SSN collection, no fee schedule despite fee references, default release of sensitive records via opt-out framing, and no statement of patient access rights or fee limitations under HIPAA."

      "summary": "Valley Medical Group provides a functional but generic MediCopy-powered records request pathway with a visible website link and online alternative, but the non-fillable PDF, missing submission instructions, lack of patient access differentiation, and unnecessary SSN collection reflect an outsourced process with limited patient-centeredness."
