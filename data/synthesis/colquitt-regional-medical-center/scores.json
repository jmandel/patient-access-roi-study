    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but with notable problems — single-page 10-item numbered list has logical flow, but lacks section headers or visual grouping, mixes plain language with legal phrasing, and provides no instructions for patient self-access use."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Patient self-access is an afterthought — the form is a generic third-party authorization that asks for a recipient name/address; the 'my personal records' purpose checkbox is the only nod to self-access, with no guidance on how to use the form for that purpose."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond legal necessity — witness signature line (not required by HIPAA), no fee disclosure, no mention of response timeframes or patient access rights, though nothing clearly violates patient rights."
