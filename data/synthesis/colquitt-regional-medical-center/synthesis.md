# Colquitt Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Colquitt Regional Medical Center (Moultrie, GA) is an independent, government-owned community hospital. The organization offers a single downloadable PDF form for medical records requests, found on its Health Records & Patient Portal page. No online portal, patient portal integration, or alternative digital pathway was identified for requesting records.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was retrieved: an "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information" — a generic HIPAA authorization form designed for releasing records to third parties. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online request portal, and no evidence of a patient portal–based records request workflow. The sole pathway is: download the PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — though the form itself provides no submission instructions (no fax number, mailing address, or email).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form is structured as an authorization for disclosure to a named recipient (item 5 asks for recipient "Name" and "Address"). While item 6 includes a "my personal records" purpose checkbox — a helpful nod toward self-access — the form does not explain what a patient should enter as the recipient when requesting their own records. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no mention of patient access rights, and no separate pathway or instructions for patients who simply want their own medical records. A patient must navigate a form designed for third-party release and adapt it to their self-access needs.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped search quickly identified the Health Records & Patient Portal page, and the form was linked with a clearly labeled "Download Medical Records Authorization Form" button — approximately two clicks from the homepage. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy**, and no bot blocking or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page scanned image** with no meaningful text layer (only 11 characters of noise extracted) and zero fillable fields. It was created in 2021 using scanning software ("Transform Foundation Server"), confirming it is a digitized paper form rather than a digitally authored document. The form is completely inaccessible to screen readers and assistive technology, cannot be filled digitally, and must be printed and completed by hand.

Despite the poor technical quality, the content design is adequate. The 10-item numbered list provides a logical flow: patient identification → who may disclose → record types → sensitive information acknowledgment → recipient → purpose → legal terms → signatures. Twelve record-type checkboxes offer useful granularity. The language mixes plain English with some legal phrasing — mostly readable but occasionally dense (e.g., the revocation paragraph). There are no section headers, boxes, or visual groupings to aid navigation, but the single-page length keeps complexity manageable.

## Barriers

- **No submission instructions**: The form contains no fax number, mailing address, email, or department name. A patient downloading the form has no guidance on how to return it. The website's Health Records page may provide this information, but it is absent from the form itself.
- **Witness signature line**: A "Signature of Witness" line is present, which may lead patients to believe a witness is required — HIPAA does not require this for patient access requests.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form makes no mention of fees or costs for records.
- **No date range field**: Patients cannot specify a time period for the records they want.
- **No delivery format options**: No choices for electronic vs. paper delivery.

## Bright Spots

- **Easy findability**: The form was prominently linked from a clearly labeled page.
- **Voluntariness statement**: Item 10 explicitly states that signing is voluntary and will not affect treatment.
- **Patient-controlled expiration**: Item 8 lets the patient set their own authorization expiration date.
- **"My personal records" purpose checkbox**: While the form is generic, this option at least acknowledges that patients may be requesting their own records.

## Overall Assessment

Colquitt Regional Medical Center provides a minimally functional records request pathway. The form is easy to find, but it is a scanned image that cannot be filled digitally, lacks submission instructions, and does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party release. The technical quality is poor — an image-only scan with no fillable fields and no accessibility support. A patient attempting to request their own records faces a form not designed for their use case, must print and handwrite their responses, and receives no guidance on how to submit the completed form. The organization earns credit for findability and a few patient-friendly touches (voluntariness statement, patient-controlled expiration), but the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.
