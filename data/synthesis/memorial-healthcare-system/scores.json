    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The PDF has a text layer and is digitally authored but has zero fillable fields, requiring print-and-handwrite completion; MyChart is listed as a delivery option providing a potential digital alternative, but the primary form workflow requires paper; no explicit fax or email submission pathway for the form itself."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The form has a logical 5-section numbered structure with granular record type options, but the acknowledgment statements (5a-5h) are dense legal text, the English PDF is bloated at 2.45 MB with garbled hidden template content, and a typo appears in the Creole version."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the form but must navigate a generic third-party authorization design — the recipient field, purpose statement, and marketing compensation section are irrelevant for self-access, and the form does not reference HIPAA Right of Access, despite offering patient-friendly delivery options."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Includes revocation rights, non-conditioning statement, and proper sensitive-information disclosure; minor ambiguities include the purpose field and electronic delivery risk-shifting language, but no requirements that would materially impede patient access."

      "summary": "Memorial Healthcare System excels at findability and offers notable patient-friendly features (trilingual forms, fast processing, multiple delivery methods) but is held back by a non-fillable, generic authorization form that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release."
