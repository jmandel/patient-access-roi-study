# Arizona Community Physicians — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Arizona Community Physicians (ACP) is an independent, for-profit physician practice group in Tucson, Arizona. The organization maintains a well-organized patient forms page at azacp.com/forms/ with seven downloadable PDFs covering general records release, practice-specific release, imaging-specific release, adult/minor access designation, a Spanish minor access form, and a HIPAA amendment request. Critically, ACP also offers an online electronic records self-request wizard through Swellbox (swellbox.com/arizona-cp-wizard.html), providing a modern digital pathway alongside the paper forms.

## Relevant Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1.pdf** — the general "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (Form 100, revised 08/26/2024). However, ACP also provides the **Swellbox online wizard**, which is the superior pathway for a patient who wants to submit a request electronically without printing, hand-filling, and physically delivering a paper form. The forms page links to both options, giving patients a choice.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

ACP does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for third-party release, with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields that frame the transaction as a provider-to-provider or provider-to-entity transfer. The "TO" field is labeled "Name of Physician/Organization," implying the recipient should be another provider rather than the patient. A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name and address in that field, but the form provides no guidance for this use case. The purpose checkboxes include "At request of Patient," which at least acknowledges patient-initiated requests, but the form structure does not differentiate the legal framework (HIPAA Right of Access under § 164.524 vs. authorization under § 164.508).

The Swellbox wizard, by contrast, may offer a more patient-centric experience as an electronic self-request tool, though its exact workflow was not evaluated as a downloadable document.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding ACP's forms was **easy**. The Patient Forms page is linked from the main website navigation, and multiple search strategies (web search, site-specific search, direct navigation) all returned direct PDF URLs. No login, bot blocking, or browser fallback was needed. The forms page is clearly organized and lists all seven documents. The Swellbox wizard link is also present on the forms page.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat (non-fillable) PDF** with a native text layer. Despite being revised in August 2024, it has zero fillable fields — all blanks are underscore placeholders requiring printing and handwriting. The layout is clean and logically organized with capitalized section headers (PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED FROM/TO, PURPOSE, TYPE OF INFORMATION). The language is generally plain and accessible, though the fee disclosure is confusingly placed as a footnote under the "Other" purpose checkbox rather than in its own section. The form collects a reasonable set of fields (~12-15 blanks) without requesting a Social Security Number — a positive privacy practice. It includes a "Former Name" field, which is a thoughtful inclusion.

The form offers three delivery format options (paper, disc/PDF, email), though email is restricted to "medical records processed by CIOX" without explaining what that means. The two-tier record type structure appropriately separates general records from protected records (HIV, behavioral health, substance abuse) with distinct consent checkboxes.

## Barriers

**No notarization or witness requirements.** Fees are disclosed at $0.07/page and $6.50/disc — both modest and within HIPAA limits — though "additional charges for shipping and handling" are mentioned without quantification. The one-year authorization expiration is standard. No response time or turnaround commitment is stated.

The most significant barrier is the **absence of submission instructions** on form-1 itself — no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal URL. A patient who downloads and prints the form has no idea where to send it. This is a functional defect. By contrast, form-7 (amendment request) includes explicit mail, fax, and in-person delivery instructions. The Swellbox wizard partially mitigates this by offering an entirely separate electronic pathway, but form-1 doesn't reference it.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox electronic self-request wizard** provides a modern digital alternative to the paper form ecosystem
- **Comprehensive form suite** — seven distinct documents covering diverse patient needs, including imaging-specific and amendment request forms
- **Spanish-language minor access form** (form-6) demonstrates language access awareness appropriate for Tucson's ~42% Hispanic population
- **No SSN collection** on the primary ROI form
- **Protected records separation** with distinct checkboxes for HIV, behavioral health, and substance abuse
- **HIPAA amendment request form** published online — uncommon among practices

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient self-access form** — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization
- **No fillable fields on any form** — all seven PDFs are flat, print-and-fill documents
- **No Spanish version of the primary ROI form** (form-1), despite Spanish availability for the minor access form
- **Missing submission instructions** on the primary ROI form
- **Fee disclosure placement** is confusing (buried under "Other" purpose checkbox)
- **1-year default records limitation** may surprise patients seeking complete history

## Overall Assessment

ACP demonstrates above-average organizational effort in making patient forms accessible online, with a well-organized forms page, a comprehensive suite of documents, and — crucially — a Swellbox electronic self-request option that elevates the patient experience beyond the paper-form baseline. However, the primary ROI form itself is a generic third-party authorization that doesn't distinguish patient self-access, lacks fillable fields, and omits submission instructions. The availability of the Swellbox pathway is the key differentiator that lifts ACP's overall assessment, though the paper form ecosystem could benefit from modernization and better patient-access-specific design.
