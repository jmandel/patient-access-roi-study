# Community Health Center, Inc. — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC) is an independent nonprofit FQHC in Middletown, Connecticut. Three PDF forms were retrieved: a standard English ROI authorization (form-2, Rev. 6/2019), a Spanish translation (form-3, Rev. 7/2019), and a site-specific variant pre-filled for the Birth to Three early intervention program (form-1). The standard English form (form-2) is the most relevant for a patient requesting their own records.

## Access Pathway and Patient Self-Access

CHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All three PDFs are variants of a single generic "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information" — a dual-purpose HIPAA authorization designed for both releasing records to third parties and obtaining records from other providers. However, the form does include an explicit self-request section: "If to ME, my records should be released via: Mail / Fax / Pick-Up / E-Mail." This accommodates patient self-access but does not distinguish it as a separate regulatory pathway (§164.524 Right of Access vs. §164.508 third-party authorization).

The patient forms page on chc1.com has transitioned from direct PDF links to Luma Health online portals for ROI requests. Two Luma Health links are now offered ("CHC to release health information to another agency" and "CHC to obtain health information from another agency"), suggesting the organization is modernizing its workflow. The site also references a myCHC patient portal for online record access. The legacy PDFs remain hosted in the WordPress uploads directory but are no longer linked from the patient-facing navigation.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability was **moderate**. The patient forms page is navigable, but the PDF forms themselves are legacy documents — discoverable only via web search or URL pattern guessing. The current site directs patients to Luma Health portals. No bot blocking or download difficulties were encountered; all PDFs downloaded cleanly.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-2) is a well-organized **single-page** document with a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → direction of disclosure → self-request delivery options → record type checkboxes → date range → sensitive information opt-ins → reason → expiration → legal notices → signature. The layout is clean with clear section headers and a side-by-side column design for the "Release TO" vs. "Obtain FROM" paths.

The form is **not fillable** — zero interactive PDF fields despite being a digitally authored document. All blanks are underscored lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. Submission is via fax (860-343-7379) or mail (575 Main Street, Middletown, CT 06457). A patient would need to print the form, fill it by hand, and fax or mail it in.

Language is mostly plain and accessible, though the legal disclosure paragraph at the bottom is dense. The form provides approximately 20 fields for a self-request (patient demographics, delivery method, record types, date range, reason, signature block). Record type options are granular (9 categories plus "Other"), and patients can specify date ranges and selectively exclude sensitive information.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. Fax submission is available, so physical delivery is not the only option. No fees are mentioned. The form states a 30-day fulfillment window, consistent with HIPAA requirements.

Two minor compliance concerns: (1) the form asks for a reason for the request (Legal, Transferring Care, etc.), which is not required for patient self-access under HIPAA; and (2) the default scope is the last 3 years unless a broader range is specified — this could inadvertently limit patients who don't realize they must explicitly request their full record.

A typo persists in the legal text ("in response to his authorization" instead of "this authorization") across both English forms.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language version** available — important for an FQHC serving a diverse Connecticut population
- **Email delivery** offered as a self-request option, which is uncommon and reduces barriers
- **Granular exclusion controls** for drug/alcohol information (patients can specify what to exclude, not just all-or-nothing)
- **Transition to Luma Health portal** suggests active modernization of the records request process
- **Single-page design** keeps the form concise and manageable

## Overall Assessment

CHC provides a functional but undifferentiated pathway for patient self-access. The generic authorization form accommodates self-requests via a dedicated delivery section, and the availability of a Spanish translation and email delivery are genuine bright spots. However, the lack of fillable fields, the conflation of patient access with third-party release, the legacy status of the PDF forms, and minor compliance gaps (reason field, default 3-year scope) prevent the organization from scoring higher. The transition to Luma Health portals is promising but could not be fully evaluated. **Grade: C** — adequate with notable room for improvement.
