      "score": 2,

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but with notable problems — logical structure and reasonable length, but language tilts toward legalese, the rights section uses complex conditional clauses, and the Spanish translation has pervasive typos and a missing delivery method section."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Patient self-access is an afterthought — the form is entirely structured as a third-party release authorization with no differentiation for individual access; patients must list themselves as the recipient and navigate a disclosure framework not designed for them."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization, no in-person requirement, clear revocation rights; however, no fee disclosure and no mention of Right of Access or patient's right to choose format."
