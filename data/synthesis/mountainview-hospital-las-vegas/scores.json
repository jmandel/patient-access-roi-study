    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital workflow — the form is fully fillable with 52 interactive fields (digital completion without printing), but submission requires fax, mail, or using a separate portal rather than integrated digital submission from the PDF itself."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — three clear sections with logical flow and 16 granular record-type checkboxes, but the single-page density is high and terms like USCDI/NPI are unexplained jargon."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic authorization form accommodates patient self-access via a radio button but is framed around third-party release, with no Right of Access distinction, recipient-focused fields, and fee language that doesn't acknowledge HIPAA access fee limits."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements beyond what the law requires — SSN collection (even optional) is unnecessary, 'reasonable copy fee' language may mislead patients about Right of Access fee limits, and no response time commitment is stated despite HIPAA's 30-day requirement."

      "summary": "MountainView Hospital offers a technically well-built, fillable authorization form with multilingual support and modern features like USCDI, but its generic third-party release framing and lack of a dedicated patient access pathway limit patient-centeredness."
