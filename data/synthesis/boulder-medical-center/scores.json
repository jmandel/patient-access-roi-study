    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds and fax submission available — the PDF has zero fillable fields requiring print-and-handwrite, but fax submission (303-449-9380) provides an electronic submission pathway; online portals exist but were not evaluated."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems — single-page layout is logically organized, but the confusing dual-direction request design, dense authorization block, and limited record type options create clarity issues."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic ROI form treats all requests identically with no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release, and the dual-direction entity routing confuses patients requesting their own records."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — the email restriction mischaracterizes HIPAA by framing a policy choice as a legal mandate, and fee disclosure is vague with no schedule, though the no-conditioning clause and reasonable expiration are properly included."
