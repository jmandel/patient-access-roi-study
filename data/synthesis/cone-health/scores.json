      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The form bundles consent for all sensitive information categories with no opt-out, provides vague fee disclosure without referencing HIPAA limits, and the CHMG form includes a non-standard liability waiver — though the hospital form correctly addresses treatment conditioning and 42 CFR Part 2."
