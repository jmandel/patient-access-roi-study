    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but with notable problems — Form 1 is cramped on a single page with weak visual hierarchy; Form 2 has better organization but contains a garbled legal citation, unnecessary SSN field, and dense footnotes with legal prose."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — both forms are generic third-party authorization forms, though Form 1 includes explicit patient self-access language and format choices that partially accommodate individual access."

      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may exceed what law requires — CD-only electronic delivery may limit HIPAA Right of Access, Form 2 collects unnecessary SSN, no fee disclosure, and blank revocation address on Form 2 undermines patient rights."
