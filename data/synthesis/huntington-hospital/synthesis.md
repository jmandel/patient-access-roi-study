# Huntington Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Huntington Hospital, a community hospital in Huntington, NY, is part of the Northwell Health system and uses Northwell's system-wide forms for all records requests. Four documents were retrieved: a general third-party Authorization for Release of Health Information (form-1) with companion instructions (form-2), and a dedicated patient-specific Request for Access form (form-3) with its own companion instructions (form-4). The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-3**, the "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative."

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Access Form

Northwell Health distinguishes itself by maintaining **two separate form types**: one for third-party release (form-1) and one specifically for patient self-access (form-3). This two-form architecture is uncommon among healthcare organizations and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to HIPAA compliance. Form-3 opens with an explicit citation of HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.524, informing patients of their right of access, and presents "To me" as the first recipient option — signaling that patient self-access is the primary use case, not an afterthought.

However, there is a notable gap: form-1 (the third-party release form) contains **no cross-reference** to form-3. A patient who encounters the general authorization first would have no indication that a separate, more appropriate form exists for their self-access request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. All four documents are directly linked from the Northwell Health medical records page at northwell.edu. The main friction point was search disambiguation — "Huntington Hospital" also refers to a facility in California, requiring "Northwell" to be added to queries. No facility-specific forms exist at huntington.northwell.edu; patients must navigate to the parent system site. URLs are descriptive (e.g., `request-for-access-to-health-information-form-english-2022.pdf`), and the filename's "english" suffix hints at a multilingual intent, though no non-English versions were found during retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3 is a strong document. At **2 pages with 28 fillable fields**, it is a genuinely interactive PDF that patients can complete digitally without printing. The layout follows a logical numbered structure: patient demographics, source facility, recipient, delivery method/format matrix, record type selection, substance use/HIV consent section, and signature block. The delivery options are notably comprehensive — mail, facility pickup, secure email, unsecure email (with explicit risk acknowledgment), fax, USB flash drive, and CD.

The language is generally accessible, using informal parenthetical labels like "(From Who)" that prioritize clarity over grammatical precision. The companion instruction document (form-4) provides step-by-step guidance with concrete examples ("Jane Patient," "Dr. Jane Jones at 300 Northwell Drive"), which is a genuine accessibility aid.

The form does have minor weaknesses: the delivery method matrix with nested checkboxes requires careful reading, and the witness signature line is ambiguous — it doesn't state whether a witness is required or optional, which could create a perceived barrier.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no notarization requirement** and does not mandate in-person submission. The expiration field applies only to substance use disorder and HIV records (consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 and NY law), not to the general access request — a correct implementation. No fees are disclosed, which avoids discouragement but leaves patients without cost visibility.

The most significant gap is the **absence of submission instructions**. Neither form-3 nor its instructions (form-4) specify where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link is provided. A patient could fill out the form perfectly and still not know what to do with it. This is a systemic gap across all four Northwell documents.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation — rare among healthcare organizations
- **28 fillable fields** enabling fully digital completion
- **Companion instruction documents** with annotated visual examples — genuinely helpful and uncommon
- **Comprehensive delivery format options** including USB flash drive and secure/unsecure email with informed consent

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No submission instructions** on any form or instruction document
- **No cross-reference** between the third-party form (form-1) and patient access form (form-3)
- **Witness line ambiguity** may deter patients who assume a witness is mandatory
- **Third-party form (form-1) lacks fillable fields** despite patient access form having 28 — inconsistent modernization

## Overall Assessment

Huntington Hospital, through its parent system Northwell Health, provides an above-average patient access experience. The dedicated patient access form with HIPAA citation, fillable fields, comprehensive delivery options, and companion instructions represent genuine investment in patient-centered design. The primary gaps — missing submission instructions and lack of cross-referencing between forms — are meaningful but do not fundamentally obstruct access. This organization earns a **B grade**, reflecting strong patient-centeredness and good document quality with room for improvement in workflow completeness.
