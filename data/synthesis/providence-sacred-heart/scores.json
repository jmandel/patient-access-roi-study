      "score": 4,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4 — patient access is clearly accommodated with a dedicated form distinct from third-party release, five delivery formats including MyChart, and multi-facility coordination, though it lacks explicit patient rights statements."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
