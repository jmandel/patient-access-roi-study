    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,

      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic authorization form serves third-party release equally, with no dedicated pathway or simplified section for patient self-access under HIPAA Right of Access."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing that would materially impede a patient — includes non-conditioning statement, revocation rights, right to inspect, and optional purpose field; no notarization or fee barriers; minor gap in not citing HIPAA § 164.524 or specifying response timeframes."
