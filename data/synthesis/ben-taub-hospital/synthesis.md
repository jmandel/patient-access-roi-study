# Ben Taub Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ben Taub Hospital is a government-owned community hospital in Houston, TX, part of the **Harris Health System**. It uses system-level forms for medical records requests — both downloaded PDFs are branded Harris Health documents, not Ben Taub–specific materials.

## Forms & Pathways

Two forms were retrieved. **Form-1** ("Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information") is the sole relevant document for a patient seeking their own records. **Form-2** is a marketing/media authorization unrelated to patient record access. Only form-1 is assessed below.

The medical records page at harrishealth.org clearly explains the request process and offers four submission channels: **mail, fax, email, and in-person drop-off**. Contact details — including phone (346-426-0980), fax (346-426-0959), and a dedicated email (Releaseofinformation@harrishealth.org) — are printed directly on the form. A patient can fill the form digitally and submit via fax or email without visiting the facility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Harris Health uses a **single dual-purpose authorization form** for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form handles this well through conditional sections: the "Purpose of Request/Disclosure" and "Expiration" sections are explicitly marked as "only required if the individual providing this authorization form to Harris Health is someone other than the patient." This means patients can skip irrelevant sections without needing a separate form. It is not a dedicated patient access form, but it clearly accommodates patient self-access as a first-class use case.

The email delivery option is labeled "Email Address (Patients Only)," further demonstrating that patient access is specifically considered in the form's design.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and it is directly linked from the medical records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or rendering issues were encountered. The PDF URL is descriptive and identifiable in search results.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page fillable PDF** with **65 interactive form fields** — a strong digital-first design. However, the fields lack programmatic names, reducing accessibility for screen readers and auto-fill. The form covers patient identification, recipient details, facility selection (with Ben Taub specifically listed), 14+ record type checkboxes, format options (paper, CD, email), sensitive information consent, and signature blocks — all on one page.

The layout is **dense but logically organized**, flowing from patient info → recipient → records scope → format → purpose → expiration → signatures. Section headers are minimal, and the cramped single-page layout sacrifices visual clarity for compactness. Language is moderately clear, leaning toward legal/administrative phrasing, but includes a well-worded non-conditioning statement. The form was recently revised (December 2024), suggesting active document management.

## Barriers & Compliance

No notarization is required and no fees are mentioned. Multiple submission channels are available. One notable concern: the form includes a **witness signature line** without clarifying whether a witness is truly required or who qualifies. This could be a practical barrier for patients completing the form at home.

The form's footer includes an **internal intranet URL** (apps.hchd.local) — inaccessible to patients and a document-control oversight. The fillable fields lack programmatic names, an accessibility deficiency.

## Bright Spots

- **Email delivery explicitly for patients** — the "Patients Only" label on the email option is a meaningful patient-access accommodation
- **Conditional sections** that let patients skip third-party–only fields
- **Granular record type selection** with 14+ categories and proper psychotherapy notes separation
- **Multiple submission channels** with contact details printed on the form
- **Dedicated authorization withdrawal email** (AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org)

## Overall Assessment

Ben Taub Hospital, through Harris Health System, provides a **competent, accessible records request process**. The form is findable, fillable, and submittable electronically. While it uses a generic authorization form rather than a dedicated patient access pathway, it thoughtfully accommodates patient self-access through conditional sections and patient-specific features like email delivery. The witness signature ambiguity and unnamed form fields are the primary weaknesses. Overall, this represents a solid B-level experience — functional and reasonably patient-friendly, with room for improvement in form clarity and dedicated patient access design.
