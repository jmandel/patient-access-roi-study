      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital with one gap — the form has 65 fillable fields for digital completion, but submission requires fax or email (not a fully integrated online workflow), and fields lack programmatic names."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but with notable problems — the single-page layout is logically organized but cramped and dense, language leans legal/administrative, section headers are minimal, and a grammatical error ('maybe' vs 'may be') creates ambiguity."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Patient access is clearly accommodated even though the form serves multiple purposes — conditional sections reduce patient burden, email delivery is patient-specific, and the non-conditioning statement is well-worded."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization required, no fees mentioned, multiple submission channels available; the witness signature ambiguity is the only notable concern."
