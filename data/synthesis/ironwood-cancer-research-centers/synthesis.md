# Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in Chandler, AZ, with eight office locations across the Phoenix metro area. Three documents were retrieved: an incoming records request form (form-1), the primary outbound ROI authorization form (form-2), and a new patient forms packet from a sister site (form-3). Only form-2 serves a patient requesting their own records from Ironwood.

## Access Pathway Assessment

Ironwood does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-2, a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" designed to serve all release purposes — patient self-access, third-party release, legal, insurance, and disability. The form uses a "To" and "From" field structure oriented toward third-party transfers, which can confuse patients seeking their own records. However, "Personal Use" is explicitly listed as the first purpose option, which partially signals awareness of patient self-access as a legitimate use case.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or use individual-access-specific language. A patient must navigate a form designed around third-party release and determine which fields apply to their situation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the ROI form required **moderate-to-significant effort**. The patient forms page at ironwoodcrc.com/patient-forms/ existed but did not expose downloadable links — possibly due to JavaScript rendering requirements or link removal. The primary ROI form (form-2) was only discoverable via site-specific search engine queries. Its URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/`) suggests it dates from March 2019 and may be effectively orphaned. Ironically, the incoming records form (form-1) was updated more recently (November 2023) and is fillable, suggesting the organization invested in making it easy for other providers to send records to Ironwood while neglecting the patient-facing release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable/interactive fields** — it must be printed and completed by hand. This is a notable gap, especially given that form-1 (the incoming records form) has 22 fillable fields. The asymmetry suggests intentional or negligent underinvestment in the patient-facing document.

The layout is logically organized: patient identification → recipient → record types → date range → purpose → delivery method → legal disclosures → signatures. Seven record type categories (physician's notes, lab reports, radiology reports, biopsy reports, prescriptions, radiology imaging, plus "Other") provide reasonable granularity for a cancer center. Five delivery methods are offered: fax, secure email, mail, pick up, and patient portal — a strong set of options including two electronic channels beyond fax.

The form lacks any introductory instructions or plain-language guidance. Legal disclosures are presented in dense paragraph format on page 2, though "I UNDERSTAND THAT" headers provide some scannability. The form is English-only with no multilingual versions available.

## Barriers and Compliance

Fee disclosure is vague: "A fee may be charged for providing the protected health information" — no amounts, no fee schedule, and critically, no distinction between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees. This ambiguity could discourage patients.

No notarization or witness signature is required. The non-conditioning statement is present and appropriate. Revocation rights are clearly stated. The authorization expires after one year, which is standard.

A notable red flag on form-1 (though not the primary patient form): the STD definition section cites Washington state law (RCW 70.24) despite Ironwood being an Arizona practice — a template-copy error that raises questions about form review diligence.

## Strengths

- **Multiple electronic delivery options**: Offering secure email and patient portal alongside fax, mail, and pickup gives patients meaningful choice — better than many comparable practices.
- **"Personal Use" as an explicit purpose**: Listing this as the first purpose option is a small but meaningful signal of patient access awareness.
- **Reasonable record type granularity**: The checkbox categories are well-suited to oncology records.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable patient form vs. fillable provider form**: The clearest indicator of misaligned priorities.
- **Orphaned form**: Not linked from any active webpage; discoverable only via search engines.
- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: Generic authorization for all release types.
- **Vague fee language**: Could deter patients from exercising their access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers provides a **minimally adequate** but clearly deprioritized pathway for patient self-access to records. The generic authorization form technically works for patient self-access, and the inclusion of electronic delivery options (secure email, patient portal) is a genuine strength. However, the non-fillable form, orphaned web presence, vague fee language, and lack of any patient-access-specific design collectively signal that individual record access is not a priority for this organization. A patient can get their records, but only after navigating search engines to find a form that wasn't designed for them.
