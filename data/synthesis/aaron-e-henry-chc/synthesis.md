# Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services Center (AEH) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Clarksdale, Mississippi. An exhaustive search of the organization's web presence found **no release-of-information form, no medical records request instructions, and no patient access pathway** available online. The only downloadable PDF found was a school-based consent-to-treat form hosted on a third-party school district website — entirely irrelevant to a patient seeking their own health records.

## Available Forms and Pathways

The sole document retrieved (form-1.pdf) is a "Mississippi Children's Health Project Parent/Guardian Consent Form" — a consent-to-treat form authorizing AEH to provide medical, dental, and vision services to children through a mobile medical unit visiting schools. While it includes a bundled release clause (releasing child health information from AEH to the school district), this is a one-directional provider-to-school release, not a patient-initiated records access mechanism. This form is **not usable** for a patient requesting their own records.

AEH operates an eClinicalWorks patient portal (mycw147.ecwcloud.com), which may contain records request functionality behind login. However, this cannot be verified without patient credentials, and the organization's website provides no guidance directing patients to the portal for records requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

AEH does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — because it provides neither pathway online. The organization appears to handle medical records requests entirely in-person or by phone, but even this is inferred rather than documented anywhere on the website. There is no medical records page, no Health Information Management section, and no mention of HIPAA rights anywhere on aehchc.org. The website's "Patient Registration Forms" section contains only online registration forms for new patients, not records request forms.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding any patient-facing form from AEH was exceptionally difficult. The search involved at least 10 targeted web queries, full website navigation, XML sitemap inspection, direct URL guessing against the WordPress uploads directory (all returning 403 errors), and Wayback Machine checks. None produced an ROI form. The consent form was only found through a broader search that surfaced a school district site (pcmac.org) hosting an AEH-branded document. A real patient attempting this search would come away empty-handed.

## Form Document Quality

Since no ROI form exists, there is no document to assess for patient records access purposes. The school consent form (form-1.pdf) is itself a well-made document — a 2-page fillable PDF with 63 interactive fields, plain-language introductory text, and clear section organization — but it serves an entirely different purpose and cannot be evaluated as a records request tool.

## Barriers and Red Flags

The primary barrier is **complete opacity**: AEH provides zero online information about how a patient can request their medical records. There is no HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices published on the website, no fee disclosure, no response-time commitment, and no statement of patient rights. A patient would need to call or visit in person just to learn how to begin the process.

The school consent form's bundled release clause (requiring parents to consent to information sharing with the school district as a condition of receiving treatment) is a separate concern relevant to that program, not to general records access.

## Notable Strengths

The only bright spot is the existence of the eClinicalWorks patient portal, which *may* provide records access for enrolled patients. If functional, this would be a meaningful pathway — but AEH does nothing to direct patients to it for this purpose, and its capabilities cannot be confirmed externally.

## Overall Assessment

AEH presents one of the most opaque records access landscapes in this study. A patient seeking their own health records from this organization would find no guidance, no forms, and no clear pathway online. The organization's web presence is focused on service descriptions, locations, and news — it does not treat patient records access as something that warrants even a single page of information. This represents a significant gap in patient-centeredness and transparency, though it is unfortunately not uncommon among smaller independent FQHCs.
