# Synthesis: Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers

## Overview

Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers (BJKPHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in St. Louis, MO, operating under the People's Family of Corporations umbrella. Despite exhaustive searching — including direct site navigation, WordPress upload directory crawling, Wayback Machine archives, and multiple search engine queries — **no downloadable Release of Information (ROI) or authorization form was found**. The only document retrieved was a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP) sourced from the parent organization's website, not the main patient-facing site.

## Available Pathways

The organization's "Requests for Release of Health Information" page (https://phcenters.org/release-of-health-information/) lists four submission channels — fax, mail, in-person, and patient portal — but provides **no downloadable form** for any of them. This creates a paradoxical situation: a patient can learn *where* to send a records request, but cannot obtain the actual request document online. The patient portal (Medfusion/NextGen) presumably contains a records request workflow behind a login wall, but this was not publicly accessible for evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

BJKPHC does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release in any publicly visible way. The single "Release of Health Information" page addresses all records requests generically. Without a downloadable form to examine, it is impossible to assess whether the in-person or portal-based process distinguishes individual access rights from third-party authorization. The NPP document mentions the right to inspect and obtain copies of PHI (Section C.3) but directs patients solely to submit written requests to the Privacy Officer at a physical address — no electronic pathway is described in the notice itself.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms for this organization was effectively impossible. The retrieval difficulty was **hard/impossible**: every strategy — from targeted Google searches to systematic crawls of the site's upload directories — came up empty. The main website's "Release of Health Information" page was easy to locate via navigation, but its value is limited to providing fax numbers and a mailing address without an accompanying form. A Patient Rights and Responsibilities document was identified on the parent site but returns a 500 Internal Server Error, suggesting it has been deleted or corrupted.

## Form Document Quality

Since no ROI form was retrieved, quality assessment falls to the NPP — the only document available. The NPP is a 10-page, digitally authored PDF with a text layer (not a scan), enabling search and screen reader access. However, it has zero fillable fields (expected for an informational notice) and contains dense regulatory language with no plain-language summary. The document suffers from several defects: entity name transpositions ("BKJPHC"), inconsistent section numbering, character encoding artifacts affecting multiple words, no effective date (required by 45 CFR 164.520), and no breach notification language (required post-HITECH). These errors suggest the document has not been meaningfully updated in over a decade.

## Barriers and Red Flags

The most significant barrier is the **complete absence of an online-accessible ROI form**. Even patients who know to fax or mail a request have no form to fill out, making these channels functionally incomplete without an in-person visit to obtain the paperwork. The NPP mentions fees for copies ("costs of copying, mailing, labor and supplies") but provides no amounts, ranges, or reference to HIPAA fee limits — leaving patients unable to anticipate costs. Complaint filing is restricted to written submissions, and no HHS contact information is provided for external complaints.

## Notable Strengths

The organization does maintain a dedicated, clearly labeled webpage for records requests, and it provides multiple submission channels (fax, mail, portal, in-person). The NPP names a specific Privacy Officer with direct contact information. These are modest positives in an otherwise challenging patient experience.

## Overall Assessment

BJKPHC presents a fundamentally incomplete online pathway for patients seeking their own health records. While the organization acknowledges patients' access rights in its NPP and provides a records request information page, the absence of any downloadable form — combined with vague fee disclosures and an outdated NPP — results in a process that effectively requires an in-person visit or existing portal credentials to initiate. For a patient approaching this organization cold, the online experience is a dead end. This represents a significant gap in patient-centeredness for an FQHC serving a vulnerable population.
