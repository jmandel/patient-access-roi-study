# JPS Health Network — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

JPS Health Network (John Peter Smith Hospital) is a government-owned community hospital in Fort Worth, TX. The organization's Patient Records page offers three downloadable forms: a primary ROI authorization form (English, with a Spanish version also available), an HIE opt-in authorization, and an HIE revocation form. Only the ROI form (form-1) is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their own medical records.

## Forms & Pathways

The primary pathway for a patient requesting their own records is a single-page **Authorization & Request for Release of Information** PDF (form-1.pdf), last revised October 2018. This is a generic ROI form — it does not differentiate between patient self-access requests under HIPAA § 164.524 and third-party release authorizations. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no patient portal pathway mentioned on the records page.

The two HIE-related forms (form-2 and form-3) are irrelevant to patient self-access — they govern provider-to-provider data sharing via a health information exchange.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The Patient Records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patient Tools → Patient Records), and web searches also surface the direct PDF URL. The page uses accordion sections to organize content, with the ROI form under "JPS Authorization Form." Fee information and submission instructions are disclosed on the page before download — a transparency positive.

## Form Document Quality

The ROI form is the weakest element of JPS's patient access process. It is an **image-only scan** — a photograph of a paper form with no text layer, no fillable fields, and no extractable text (literally 1 character of output from text extraction). At 478 KB for a single page, it is technically a picture, not a document. It cannot be completed digitally, is invisible to screen readers, and fails basic digital accessibility standards.

The irony is sharp: JPS's 2025 HIE forms demonstrate the organization can produce modern, fillable, text-searchable PDFs with encrypted email submission. The core ROI form — the one patients actually need — remains a 2018 scan that has not been updated in over seven years.

The form is one page, which is an appropriate length. However, because it is an image-only scan, detailed analysis of layout, language clarity, field count, and instructions is limited to visual inspection rather than text analysis.

## Access Pathway Assessment

JPS does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The single ROI form appears to serve all release purposes. The fee schedule on the web page does not distinguish between patient access fees (which HIPAA limits to reasonable, cost-based amounts) and third-party release fees (which Texas state law governs at higher rates). This conflation is a significant patient-centeredness gap.

Submission is limited to **print, handwrite, and mail or fax**. The Patient Records page explicitly states: "It is not possible to accept electronic transfer of this form at this time." Fax is available (which counts as an adequate electronic pathway and avoids the worst penalties), but the form itself cannot be filled digitally — it must be printed and handwritten.

## Barriers

- **Potentially excessive fees**: $30 for the first 10 pages, per-page charges thereafter, and a $75 flat fee for electronic delivery. The $75 electronic delivery fee likely exceeds HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based" standard for patient access requests. The fee schedule does not distinguish patient access from third-party requests.
- **No electronic form submission**: Despite having the technical capability (demonstrated by HIE forms accepting encrypted email), JPS refuses electronic submission of the ROI form.
- **Government photo ID required at pickup**: Standard practice but limits delivery to in-person collection.
- **Stale form**: Over 7 years old, predating HHS Right of Access enforcement actions and 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Bright Spots

- **Spanish language version** available for the ROI form, appropriate for Fort Worth demographics.
- **Fee disclosure** is transparent — patients know costs before downloading the form.
- **Easy findability** — the form is prominent and well-organized on the website.
- **HIE forms show capability** — the 2025 HIE forms prove JPS can do better, which makes the outdated ROI form a choice rather than a limitation.

## Overall Assessment

JPS Health Network presents a frustrating contradiction. The organization clearly has the technical capability and institutional will to produce modern, accessible digital forms — the 2025 HIE forms are well-designed, fillable, and accept encrypted email submission. Yet the core ROI form that patients actually need to request their own records remains a seven-year-old image scan with no digital functionality. Combined with potentially excessive fees and no electronic submission, the patient experience is well below what this organization could deliver. The form is easy to find, and fax submission is available, but the document itself is a relic that creates unnecessary barriers for patients exercising their access rights.
