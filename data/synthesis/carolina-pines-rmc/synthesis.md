# Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, a ScionHealth-affiliated for-profit community hospital in Hartsville, SC, offers two publicly available ROI forms: an English "Release of Information Authorization / Requisition Form" (form-1.pdf) and an identical Spanish translation (form-2.pdf). Both are hosted on ScionHealth's CMS infrastructure and linked directly from the hospital's medical records page at cprmc.com/medical-records. No additional patient access forms, online portals, or digital request wizards were found. The hospital uses MRO Corp as its third-party ROI vendor for processing requests.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. Both forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms structured around a "disclosing provider → recipient" model. A patient requesting their own records must fill in the "Name of Recipient" section with their own information — a workflow designed for third-party disclosure, not individual access. The form references 45 CFR 160 and 164 only in the context of redisclosure risk and never mentions HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524). There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no simplified self-request form, and no portal-based alternative.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-specific web search immediately surfaced both PDF URLs, and the medical records page provides direct links alongside submission instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, or multi-click navigation was encountered. File names are descriptive (`Authorization_Update_(English).pdf`). This is one of the easier retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — but with **zero fillable fields**. Every field must be completed by printing and handwriting. The layout is organized into two sections: Section A for patient and recipient demographics plus record type selection, and Section B for seven legal statements with a signature block. The 15-category record type checklist (face sheet, H&P, labs, imaging, etc.) with an "All Records" option provides good granularity. However, the single-page format forces dense layout with limited whitespace, and the legal statements use moderately complex language referencing CFR provisions. The form lacks instructions beyond section labels, provides no guidance on how patients will receive their records, and includes a "purpose/reason for this request" field without noting that HIPAA does not require patients to justify self-access requests.

## Barriers and Red Flags

Two notable red flags emerge. First, Statement 6 states that patients "may need to have my physician authorize" the use or disclosure of sensitive information in their records — language that could function as an illegitimate barrier to patient access under HIPAA's Right of Access. Second, the "For Office Use Only" section includes a Social Security number field, creating unnecessary data exposure risk. The form discloses no fees, states no response timeline, and does not mention the MRO Corp third-party vendor relationship. On the positive side, no notarization is required, and submission channels include fax and email in addition to in-person delivery — adequate electronic submission options.

## Notable Strengths

The availability of a professionally translated Spanish-language form is a genuine bright spot, particularly for a community hospital. Both language versions are equally accessible from the medical records page. The granular record type selection gives patients meaningful control over their request scope. The easy online findability — direct links, descriptive URLs, no access barriers — represents a model for form availability.

## Overall Assessment

Carolina Pines provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The forms are easy to find and submit, and the Spanish translation is commendable. However, the lack of any patient self-access differentiation, zero fillable fields, concerning physician-gating language for sensitive records, and absence of fee or timeline transparency place this organization squarely in the middle tier. A patient can navigate this process, but the form was not designed with them as the primary audience.
