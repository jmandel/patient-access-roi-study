      "score": 3,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Physician gating language for sensitive records and purpose-of-request field go beyond HIPAA requirements for patient access; no fee disclosure and no response timeline add ambiguity, though revocation rights and non-conditioning are properly stated."
