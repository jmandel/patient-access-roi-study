      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: primarily a paper workflow — the form has zero fillable fields requiring print-and-handwrite, and the only stated submission method is physical mail (no fax or electronic submission option documented on the form)."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: adequate with notable problems — well-organized layout and useful tiered record selection, but dense legalese opening paragraph, contradictory sensitive-records language, initialing friction, and indirect submission instructions create genuine clarity issues."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: patient access is clearly accommodated with an explicit 'personal use' checkbox and multiple delivery options, though the form remains a generic authorization rather than a dedicated patient access form."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: no notarization or witness required, appropriate non-conditioning and revocation language, but no fee disclosure whatsoever and the HIPAA Right of Access citation (CFR 164.524) present in the predecessor form was dropped."

      "summary": "Ascension St. Vincent's East offers a reasonably patient-centered authorization form with a personal-use checkbox and tiered record selection, but the lack of fillable fields, apparent mail-only submission, branding-transition findability challenges, and absent fee disclosure result in a primarily paper workflow that falls short of modern digital accessibility standards."
