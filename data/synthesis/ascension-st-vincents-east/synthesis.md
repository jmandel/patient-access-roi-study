# Ascension St. Vincent's East — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Ascension St. Vincent's East is a community hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the Ascension health system that has recently partnered with or been rebranded under UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham). This branding transition is the defining feature of the patient experience: two forms exist on two different websites under two different organizational names, and a patient searching under the facility's commonly known name may land on the wrong (legacy) form.

## Forms and Pathways

Two PDF authorization forms were found:

- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An Ascension St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization To Disclose Protected Health Information" revised February 2022, hosted on `healthcare.ascension.org` in a URL path containing the word "legacy." This 2.8 MB, 2-page form is a general-purpose ROI authorization with no distinction between patient self-access and third-party release. It collects Social Security Number, lists notarized signature among identity verification options, and requires a witness signature — all potential barriers. On the positive side, it explicitly cites CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA Right of Access).

- **form-2.pdf** (current): A UAB St. Vincent's–branded "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Patient Information Hospital Records" dated February 2026, hosted on `uabstvincents.org`. This is the current, most relevant form. At 143 KB and 2 pages, it is a cleaner, digital-origin document. It explicitly lists "UAB St. Vincent's East including the Free-Standing Emergency Department" as a selectable location and includes a checkbox for "me for my personal use" — a meaningful distinction from forms that only contemplate third-party release.

The best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records is form-2, which accommodates patient self-access as a first-class option alongside third-party authorization.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Form-2 does differentiate patient self-access from third-party release via a checkbox ("me for my personal use" vs. "the party indicated below"). This is a genuine improvement over many ROI forms and over this facility's own predecessor form. However, form-2 remains a generic authorization form — not a dedicated patient access request form. The same form, same legal language, and same process apply whether the patient wants their own records or is authorizing release to an insurer or attorney. A patient must navigate legal language about re-disclosure, initial two dense paragraphs about revocation and non-conditioning, and understand which fields apply to their scenario.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the current form required moderate effort. Initial searches for "Ascension St. Vincent's East" yielded system-wide Ascension forms from other states. An Alabama-specific search found the legacy form-1 on the Ascension domain. Only a separate search for "UAB St. Vincent's" uncovered the current form-2 on the UAB domain. A patient who knows this facility by its Ascension name would likely find only the outdated 2022 form. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed — both PDFs downloaded directly.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a digital-origin PDF with a text layer, reasonable file size, and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all entries must be handwritten after printing. The form uses horizontal rules to separate sections and offers a well-designed tiered record selection (Key Clinical Notes bundle, Entire Medical Record, or specific report types). The "Key Clinical Notes" option — pre-defined as discharge summary, operative reports, labs, radiology, and ED documentation — is a genuine usability bright spot that helps patients who don't know medical terminology.

The opening paragraph front-loads dense legal language before the patient even fills in their name. The form contains a contradictory treatment of sensitive records: the opening paragraph states the request "includes" psychiatric and substance use information, while a later checkbox asks whether to include it. The submission instructions are indirect — rather than printing a mailing address, the form directs patients to visit a website.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form-2 removes several barriers present in the legacy form: no Social Security Number field, no notarization option, no witness requirement. Non-conditioning and revocation rights are clearly stated (with initialing required). However, the form provides no fee disclosure whatsoever — patients have no idea what records will cost. The HIPAA Right of Access citation (CFR 164.524) present in form-1 was dropped in form-2, a notable regression. Submission appears limited to physical mail; no fax number or electronic submission option for the completed form is stated.

## Overall Assessment

Ascension St. Vincent's East earns credit for a reasonably well-designed authorization form that explicitly accommodates patient self-access with a personal-use checkbox and offers tiered record selection. However, the experience is undermined by the branding transition that makes the current form hard to find, zero fillable fields requiring a fully paper workflow, apparent mail-only form submission, and absent fee disclosure. The result is a facility that has the right instincts on patient-centeredness but falls short on digital accessibility and transparency.
