# University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two versions of the same form were found: **Form 1989 ("ADMIN – Consent to Release of Information and Right of Access Request")**. Form-1 is the current official version (revised May 2024), hosted on the university's healthcare domain. Form-2 is an older revision (August 2021) hosted on a third-party CDN, pre-populated for a driving rehabilitation service ("Safer Driver Solutions"). Form-1 is the canonical, patient-facing document; form-2 is irrelevant for direct patient self-access and is included only for completeness.

The organization directs patients to a clear medical records request page at `uihc.org/medical-records-request`, which links to the PDF form and provides submission instructions. Submission options include email (`him-consentform@uiowa.edu`), fax (two numbers), and physical mail — a notably flexible set of channels.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form title explicitly names both functions: "Consent to Release of Information **AND** Right of Access Request." This dual-purpose naming is unusual and shows awareness that patients may exercise their HIPAA right of access. However, the form body does not differentiate the two use cases. There is no dedicated patient self-access form, no separate workflow, and — critically — no "send records to myself" shortcut. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Send UI Health Care information to" field, effectively treating themselves as a third party. Ironically, the older form-2 included a "Myself at the address above unless noted below" option, which the current revision dropped.

The organization does not distinguish between individual access requests (governed by HIPAA § 164.524) and third-party authorization (governed by § 164.508) in its process or documentation. This is a **generic HIPAA authorization** that acknowledges patient access in name only.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A single web search returned the direct PDF link. The official medical records page provides clear context and instructions. No bot blocking, login walls, CAPTCHAs, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, natively digital PDF with a clean text layer (4,233 characters). Despite being digitally created, it has **zero fillable fields** — a significant regression from the older form-2, which had 50 fillable fields. Patients must print the form, complete it by hand, scan it, and then submit electronically (email or fax) or by mail. The form's consent language acknowledges electronic completion ("as valid as if you signed the consent in writing"), creating a paradox: the form claims to support electronic completion but provides no interactive fields to enable it.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → recipient → format options → record types → date range → reason → consent → sensitive categories → expiration → signature. Sections are spatially separated but lack labeled headers. The language is generally clear, though the consent block contains moderately dense legal prose. Record type options are comprehensive (16+ checkboxes), and the form thoughtfully includes legacy entity lines for patients who received care under prior organizational names (Corridor OB GYN, Mercy Clinics, Mercy Hospital).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states a 30-day response commitment, aligning with HIPAA requirements. The non-conditioning statement is present and properly worded. Fee disclosure is vague: "I understand there may be a charge for this information" — without distinguishing between patient access fees (limited under HIPAA) and third-party release fees. Revocation requires written notification to the Director of Health Information Management, a minor but unnecessary barrier.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots**: Exceptional findability. Multiple electronic submission channels including email. Dual-purpose form title acknowledging right of access. Legacy entity lines accommodating merged organizations. Comprehensive record type selection. Five delivery format options including electronic media (CD, USB, email).

**Red flags**: The current official form regressed from 50 fillable fields to zero — a clear step backward in digital accessibility. The removal of the "Myself" recipient option from the current form makes patient self-access less intuitive than in the older version. Vague fee language fails to inform patients of their right to cost-based fees under HIPAA.

## Overall Assessment

University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics earns credit for excellent findability, multiple submission channels, and a form that at least names patient access in its title. However, the lack of fillable fields on the current form, the absence of a differentiated patient self-access pathway, and the regression from the more interactive older version weigh against it. The organization provides an adequate but not patient-centered experience — a patient can get their records, but must navigate a form designed primarily for third-party authorization using a print-and-fill workflow.
