# Yale New Haven Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH), a major teaching hospital in New Haven, CT, is part of the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS). For medical records requests, YNHH uses a system-wide fillable PDF form titled "Authorization for Access/Release of Information" (Form F4918Eng, dated 07/19). A second form exists for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, another YNHHS facility, but it is not the primary form for YNHH patients. The assessment below focuses on Form 1 as the best available pathway for a patient requesting their own records from Yale New Haven Hospital.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization with Patient-Friendly Features

YNHH does not offer a dedicated patient access form distinct from its third-party release authorization. The single system-wide form serves both purposes. However, the form makes notable accommodations for patient self-access: the title includes the word "Access" (not just "Release"), "Personal use" is listed as the first purpose option, and the form supports bidirectional requests (both "RELEASE information TO" and "OBTAIN information FROM"). Despite these touches, the underlying structure is a generic HIPAA authorization. A patient requesting their own records must designate themselves as the "recipient" — an awkward fit that reveals the form's third-party-release DNA. The form does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 or frame the request as an exercise of the patient's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A simple web search immediately surfaced it on the YNHHS parent system website, which hosts a dedicated "Request Medical Records" page with direct PDF download links. No login, account creation, or bot-blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on ynhhs.org (parent system) rather than ynhh.org (hospital), which is logical but could cause mild confusion for patients starting at the hospital's own site.

## Form Document Quality

Form 1 is an impressive digital artifact. It is a born-digital, fillable PDF with 97 interactive form fields — one of the highest counts in the study. Every data-entry point appears to have an interactive field, enabling patients to complete the form entirely on-screen before printing for signature. The two-page layout follows a logical flow: patient identity → purpose → recipient → delivery method → facility/visit selection → date range → record types → sensitive information exclusions → legal disclosures → submission instructions → signature. Sections are clearly delineated and the form is dense but functional.

The language is mostly clear in the data-entry sections but shifts to dense legal prose in the "I understand that" statements on page 2. The minor consent paragraph is particularly complex, with nested age thresholds under Connecticut state law. The sensitive information section uses an opt-out model (all sensitive records released unless the patient initials specific exclusions), which is patient-friendly in intent but uses double-negative framing that could confuse.

## Submission and Delivery

The form offers robust submission options: mail (PO Box 9565, New Haven), fax (203-688-4645), and three email addresses differentiated by entity (Hospital, NEMG, Yale Medicine). This flexibility is a genuine strength — patients can submit electronically without visiting the facility.

For delivery, five options are available: MyChart portal (requiring an active account), mail, fax, secure email, and pick-up. MyChart delivery is a standout feature that most ROI forms lack, offering an end-to-end electronic pathway for records receipt.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness is required. No in-person submission is mandated. The authorization is valid for one year, and revocation rights are clearly explained. The voluntariness statement is explicit: treatment is not conditioned on signing.

The main compliance gap is ambiguous fee language. "Reasonable cost-based fees apply" appears next to radiology images, while "There may be a charge for copies in accordance with Connecticut law" appears in the legal section. Neither amount is disclosed, and the form does not clarify whether the HIPAA cost-based fee ceiling applies when a patient requests their own records. The turnaround commitment of 10 business days is explicit and well within HIPAA's 30-day limit.

## Notable Strengths

- **97 fillable fields** — exceptionally high digital-first form design
- **MyChart delivery** — electronic records receipt via patient portal
- **Multiple submission channels** — three email addresses, fax, and mail
- **Granular record selection** — 17 specific categories plus complete record option
- **10-business-day turnaround commitment** with a customer service phone number

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway** — patients use the same form as third-party requesters
- **Wet signature required** — breaks the digital workflow (fill → print → sign → scan → email)
- **Fee language is ambiguous** — does not distinguish patient-access fees from third-party fees
- **Form last updated July 2019** — nearly seven years old, may not reflect current policies
- **No multilingual versions found**

## Overall Assessment

Yale New Haven Hospital provides a competent, digitally mature records request experience that falls short of true patient-centeredness. The fillable PDF, multiple submission/delivery options, and MyChart integration demonstrate genuine investment in accessibility. However, the organization has not taken the step of creating a distinct patient access pathway — patients must navigate a dual-purpose authorization form designed primarily for third-party release. The result is a solid B-level experience: functional and mostly friction-free, but not designed around the patient's perspective.
