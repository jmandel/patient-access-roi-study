      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital with one gap — the form has 97 fillable fields enabling full digital completion, but requires printing for a wet signature before submitting electronically via email or fax."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — logical section flow, clear headers, and granular record selection, but dense legal prose in the 'I understand' statements and confusing double-negative framing for sensitive information opt-outs."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — despite 'Personal use' purpose checkbox and 'Access' in the title, patients must navigate a third-party release framework and designate themselves as the 'recipient,' with no HIPAA Right of Access citation."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization, no in-person requirement, clear revocation and voluntariness language, but fee disclosure is ambiguous and does not distinguish patient-access fees from third-party copy charges."
