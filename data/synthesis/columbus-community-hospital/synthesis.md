# Columbus Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Columbus Community Hospital is an independent nonprofit community hospital in Columbus, Nebraska. A single ROI form was found: a one-page "Authorization to Release Medical Records" (form MR-1, dated December 2014). The hospital does not offer a patient portal-based records request, an online request wizard, or any dedicated patient self-access form. The sole pathway is this generic third-party authorization form, with email submission available via `release@columbusch.com`.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release Only

The most significant finding is that Columbus Community Hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The form is structured entirely as a release authorization: "I authorize Columbus Community Hospital to release the following information on [patient] to: [Name and Address]." A patient requesting their own records must write their own name and address in the "to:" field — an unintuitive workaround with no guidance that this is a valid or expected use of the form. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that patients have a right to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required **moderate effort**. The hospital operates two domains: `columbusch.com` (the primary patient-facing site) and `columbushosp.org` (a legacy domain hosting the PDF). The patient forms page on the newer site mentions the Release of Information form and provides an email address for submission, but does not include a direct download link. A web search was needed to surface the PDF URL on the legacy domain. No bot blocking or technical barriers were encountered during download.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** with zero interactive fields. All blanks are represented as printed underscores requiring handwritten completion. Despite having a text layer (not a scan), the document offers no digital interaction — patients must print, handwrite, and then scan or photograph it to submit via email.

At one page, the form is concise. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, recipient identification, treatment dates, record type checkboxes (nine options plus "Complete Record"), purpose checkboxes (six options), sensitive-information authorization, patient acknowledgments, and signature blocks. However, the single-page density leaves little whitespace, and internal filing codes appear in the footer ("Found in Policy Manager/Consent Forms," "c: HIPAA Manual," page "42") — artifacts of internal document management that were never removed for patient-facing use.

Language is generally understandable but includes unexplained jargon ("H & P") and legalistic constructions in the acknowledgment section. The form includes no instructions or guidance text explaining how to complete it.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form avoids several common barriers: no fees are mentioned, no notarization is required, and no in-person submission is mandated. The revocation rights are clearly stated, and a built-in "Notice of Revocation" section allows patients to revoke authorization without finding a separate form — a genuine bright spot. The non-retaliation statement and 12-month authorization expiration are appropriate.

However, the witness signature line is ambiguous — it is unclear whether a witness is required or optional, which could deter patients completing the form at home. The form's age (dated 2014, over 11 years old at evaluation) raises questions about whether it reflects current regulatory requirements.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bright spots:** Built-in revocation section; granular record-type selection (nine categories); email submission channel available; concise single-page format.

**Red flags:** No patient self-access pathway; form structured exclusively for third-party release; no mention of patient rights; non-fillable PDF requiring print and handwrite; internal filing codes visible on patient-facing document; disconnected web presence with form hosted on legacy domain without links from the main site.

## Overall Assessment

Columbus Community Hospital provides a minimally functional but outdated and poorly patient-centered records request process. The form works — a determined patient can download it, fill it out by hand, and email it in — but the experience reflects a pre-digital, compliance-oriented approach rather than a patient-access-oriented one. The absence of any dedicated patient self-access pathway, combined with a non-fillable form from 2014 and a fragmented web presence, places this organization below average for patient-centeredness. **Grade: C**
