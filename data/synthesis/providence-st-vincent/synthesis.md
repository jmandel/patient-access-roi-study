# Providence St. Vincent Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Providence St. Vincent Medical Center does not publish facility-specific ROI forms. All record request forms are managed at the parent system level by Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), a major nonprofit health system spanning seven states. Three overlapping forms were found on the Providence HIM page:

1. **Form-1** — "Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information" (ORC 240A, rev. 03/20): A general-purpose ROI authorization covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Includes a "Self" checkbox but is framed around disclosure to others.
2. **Form-2** — "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set" (940507, dated 3/27/25): A dedicated patient access form with updated PSJH branding and R1RCM vendor contact info. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
3. **Form-3** — "Patient Request for Access to Designated Record Set" (rev. 03/20): An older OR/MT-specific patient access form that form-2 appears to supersede, with outdated PH&S branding and contact information.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Providence meaningfully distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Form-2 is explicitly titled as a "Patient Request to Access" and defaults to disclosure "to Myself" as the first option. This is a genuine dedicated patient access form — not a generic authorization repurposed with a self-access checkbox. However, the general authorization (form-1) is more easily found via web search, meaning a patient may encounter the less appropriate form first. The HIM page does not clearly guide patients toward form-2 over form-1.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the correct form required pivoting from the facility name to the parent system. A search for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center" did not surface ROI forms directly — searchers had to navigate to the system-level HIM page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management`. Once found, this page is comprehensive, listing multiple forms with instructions. However, the presence of three overlapping forms with no clear guidance on which is current creates confusion. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2, the primary patient access form, is a well-constructed digital document. At 3 pages and 72 fillable fields, it is genuinely interactive — patients can complete nearly every field digitally before printing for signature. The layout uses clearly labeled sections (patient information, use and disclosure, record type selection, rights statement, signature) with capitalized headers. Record type options are helpfully tiered: "Pertinent information" (with an explanatory list of common record types) versus "All/Entire Medical Record," plus an "Other" field and "Last two years only" option.

The language is mostly clear, though the title uses the HIPAA term "Designated Record Set" rather than plain-language alternatives. The opening warning — "Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization" — is somewhat intimidating without clarifying which fields are required versus optional.

Five delivery options are offered: MyChart, Paper (Mailed), CD (Mailed), FAX, and Email. Including MyChart is a notable patient-friendly touch. Submission can be made by mail, email (ROIHIMreception@r1rcm.com), or fax — no in-person visit is required.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable barrier is the wet-signature requirement on forms 1 and 3, though form-2 may accept electronic signatures (it lacks the explicit "Print form and sign by hand" instruction found on the others). Fees are disclosed vaguely — "there may be a fee" — without specifying amounts or referencing HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access.

A potential red flag appears in form-2's internal "HOSPITAL USE ONLY" section, which includes a physician approval/denial workflow for record release. Under HIPAA § 164.524, denial of patient access is permitted only in narrow circumstances; a blanket physician-approval gate could constitute an unreasonable barrier if applied broadly.

The continued publication of the outdated form-3 alongside form-2, with different contact information and organizational branding, risks sending patients to non-functional channels.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from general third-party authorization
- **72 fillable interactive fields** on the primary form — genuinely digital-first design
- **Five delivery format options** including MyChart and email
- **Multilingual language assistance notices** in English, Spanish, and Chinese
- **Multiple submission channels** (mail, email, fax) with no in-person requirement
- **Comprehensive HIM page** with centralized ROI processing

## Overall Assessment

Providence St. Vincent, through its parent system, provides an above-average patient record request experience. The existence of a dedicated patient access form with strong digital fillability and multiple delivery options demonstrates genuine attention to patient needs. The main weaknesses are findability (requiring navigation from facility to system-level resources), form proliferation without clear versioning guidance, vague fee disclosures, and the physician-approval gate embedded in form-2's workflow. A patient who finds form-2 will have a good experience; the challenge is ensuring they find it.
