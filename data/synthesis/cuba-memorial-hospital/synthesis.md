# Cuba Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Cuba Memorial Hospital is a small, independent critical access hospital in Cuba, NY, affiliated with the Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS) alongside Olean General Hospital (OGH) and Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC). The hospital does not publish its own medical records request form. Instead, patients must discover and use ROI forms from affiliated UAHS facilities, found on a separate organization's website.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two forms were retrieved, both from the BRMC-OGH website (brmc-ogh.org), not from Cuba Memorial's own site:

- **Form 1 (OGH)**: "Authorization for Patient Access and/or Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information," branded for Olean General Hospital. This is the most relevant form since both OGH and Cuba Memorial are New York facilities within UAHS.
- **Form 2 (BRMC)**: Nearly identical form branded for Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Less relevant due to cross-state jurisdiction, but its blank disclosing-organization field makes it theoretically more adaptable.

The hospital's website also mentions a "YourHEALTH" patient portal for electronic record access, but no ROI form or formal request process is linked from the portal page.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The forms are dual-purpose: their title explicitly covers both "Patient Access" and "Use and Disclosure." Section 4 includes dedicated checkboxes for patient inspection or copies, alongside a third-party release authorization line. This is a modest positive — the form acknowledges patient self-access as a use case rather than treating it as an afterthought. However, the form is fundamentally a generic HIPAA authorization that serves all release purposes, not a dedicated patient access form. A Cuba Memorial patient must also contend with the fact that neither form mentions their hospital by name, creating real confusion about which form to use and where to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding these forms was moderately difficult. Cuba Memorial Hospital's own website has no medical records page, no patient forms section, and no downloadable ROI form. Multiple search strategies — including site-specific searches, direct navigation, and sitemap review — yielded nothing. The forms were only discovered by following a small footer link from Cuba Memorial's site to the BRMC-OGH website, then navigating to the medical records page. A patient would need to recognize this footer link as relevant, navigate a different organization's site, and infer that the "OGH" form applies to their Cuba Memorial records — a non-obvious multi-step process.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms are 2-page, digitally produced PDFs with text layers — not scans. However, neither has fillable fields (fillable_field_count: 0). Patients must print and complete them by hand. The forms use a numbered seven-section structure (authorization statement, disclosing organization, record types, recipient/patient access, patient rights, expiration, specially protected information) that provides reasonable organization. Approximately 15 fields require completion for a patient self-access request.

The language is moderately legalistic but generally comprehensible. Patient rights statements in Section 5 cover voluntariness, no treatment impact, revocation rights, re-disclosure risk, and right to copies. However, a typo in Section 5(c) — "but in do" instead of "but if I do" — has persisted across both forms since at least 2017, suggesting the templates are unmaintained.

## Barriers

- **No clear submission pathway**: The forms provide no instructions for how to submit them. The bolded statement "Photo ID is required for records to be picked up" implies in-person pickup as the expected or only delivery method. No fax number, email address, mailing address, or online submission option is mentioned on the form or the BRMC-OGH medical records page.
- **Witness lines**: Dedicated witness signature lines appear without indication of whether witnessing is required or optional, potentially deterring patients from submitting unwitnessed forms.
- **90-day expiration**: Authorization expires after 90 days, which is unnecessary for patient access requests under HIPAA's ongoing right of access.
- **Vague fee disclosure**: Section 5(e) mentions "a reasonable copy fee" with no specifics or fee schedule reference.
- **Outdated forms**: Both forms were last revised in January 2017, predating Information Blocking rules and 21st Century Cures Act implementation.

## Strengths

- The form explicitly contemplates patient self-access with dedicated inspection/copies checkboxes — relatively uncommon among generic authorization forms.
- Granular record type selection (11 categories with date ranges) gives patients meaningful control over their request scope.
- Appropriate handling of specially protected information (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) with separate consent checkboxes consistent with New York law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Overall Assessment

Cuba Memorial Hospital presents significant access challenges for patients seeking their own records online. The hospital publishes no form of its own, requiring patients to navigate to an affiliated organization's website and use a form branded for a different hospital. The forms themselves, while structurally adequate and notably inclusive of patient self-access checkboxes, are non-fillable, outdated, and provide no guidance on submission or delivery methods. The implied requirement for in-person pickup with photo ID — potentially at a facility 30+ miles away — represents a meaningful barrier for a rural critical access hospital population. The overall experience falls short of patient-centered design, earning a grade of C.
