      "score": 4,

      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate single-page layout with logical flow and useful checkboxes, but dense legal text in the lower third, no submission instructions, all-or-nothing sensitive information bundling, and a default-to-minimal-records warning create notable clarity problems."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The PDF form is a generic third-party authorization — patients must identify themselves as both patient and recipient and navigate fields designed for broader use. The Swellbox portal partially compensates, but the downloadable form itself was not designed for patient self-access."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
