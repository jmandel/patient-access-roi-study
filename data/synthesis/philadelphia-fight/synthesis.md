# Synthesis: Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers

## Overview

Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers (Philadelphia, PA) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC historically focused on HIV/AIDS care. The organization maintains a well-organized "Forms and Consents" page on its website with direct PDF download links, offering forms in both English and Spanish. Two ROI-related forms were found: a dedicated patient access form (form-1) and a separate third-party authorization form (form-2).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Philadelphia FIGHT stands out by maintaining **separate forms for patient self-access and third-party release** — a best practice that many larger organizations fail to implement. Form-1, titled "Patient Request for Access to Information," is explicitly designed for patients exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (§ 164.524). It opens with a clear rights statement and deals exclusively with the patient's own records. Form-2, the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Information," is a standard § 164.508 authorization for third-party disclosures. This structural separation means patients requesting their own records are not funneled through a generic authorization workflow designed for insurers, attorneys, or other third parties.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. The Forms and Consents page is accessible via the main navigation (About → Forms and Consents) and was surfaced quickly by a site-specific web search. Direct PDF download links with descriptive text ("Request for Access to Information Form") made identification easy. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or other technical obstacles were encountered. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF with a clean text layer. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are underscores requiring print-and-fill or PDF annotation workarounds. This is a meaningful gap given that the form was clearly authored digitally (7 fonts, embedded logo) and could easily have been made interactive.

The form's structure follows a logical flow: patient identification, scope of request (entire medical record, billing record, or specific records), access method (copy vs. inspection), format preference (paper or electronic with a "Specify" field), delivery method (pick up or mail), and requester identification (self, guardian, or representative). At one page, it is appropriately concise.

The language is moderately complex. The introductory paragraph front-loads legal information about timelines, fees, and denial rights in dense prose. While accurate, it could be more accessible if broken into bullet points. The form does not use explicit section headers beyond the internal-use divider.

## Submission Methods

Form-1 lists four submission channels: in-person, email (privacy@fight.org), fax (215-732-1145), and mail. The inclusion of **email submission** is a notable strength — many organizations limit submission to fax and mail. A patient can complete and submit the form without physically visiting the facility.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **Fee language is vague**: The form describes four categories of chargeable costs (labor, supplies, postage, summary preparation) but provides no dollar amounts, fee schedule, or cost estimates. Costs are billed after fulfillment, with no mechanism for a patient to learn the cost in advance or set a spending limit.
- **No mention of right to appeal a denial**: The form states FIGHT may deny access but does not inform the patient of their right to request review of a denial, which HIPAA requires for reviewable denials under § 164.524(d)(4).
- **Response timeline stated**: 30 days, with possible 60-day extension — consistent with HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a structural best practice.
- **Email submission option** in addition to fax, mail, and in-person — a low-barrier digital channel.
- **Electronic format option** with an open "Specify" field, respecting the patient's right to choose format.
- **Adolescent self-access at age 13+**, reflecting Pennsylvania minor consent law.
- **Bilingual availability** (English and Spanish) on the Forms and Consents page.
- **Sensitive information opt-out** on the third-party form, with granular categories (HIV, mental health, substance abuse) — especially relevant for this organization's patient population.

## Overall Assessment

Philadelphia FIGHT delivers an above-average patient access experience among FQHCs. The structural decision to separate patient access from third-party authorization is the standout feature, demonstrating clear understanding of HIPAA's distinct provisions. The form is concise, logically organized, and offers multiple submission channels including email. The main weaknesses are the lack of fillable PDF fields (forcing a print-and-fill workflow), vague fee disclosures, and the omission of denial appeal rights. With relatively modest improvements — adding fillable fields and clarifying fees — this organization could achieve an excellent rating.
