# El Centro de Corazón — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

El Centro de Corazón is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Houston, Texas. It offers a single downloadable PDF form for health information disclosure — a bilingual (English/Spanish) "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information." This form is the only pathway available for patients seeking their own medical records, and it is oriented entirely toward third-party release of information rather than patient self-access.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page authorization for disclosure hosted on the organization's WordPress site. Page 1 is in English, page 2 is a Spanish translation. No patient portal–based request pathway, online submission wizard, or dedicated patient access form was identified. The form's fax number (713-926-9105) is printed on the document, suggesting fax is an accepted submission method, though this is not explicitly stated as a submission instruction. No email, portal, or other electronic submission options are mentioned.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

El Centro de Corazón does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The form uses a "provide to / receive from (circle one)" structure that presumes records flow between El Centro and another entity. There is no "send records to me, the patient" option. Among the nine reason-for-disclosure checkboxes (Continuing of Care, Financial Insurance Verification, Legal Proceedings, etc.), none corresponds to "personal/patient request." A patient wanting their own records must use the "Other (Specify)" write-in, which is unintuitive and signals that patient self-access was not a design consideration.

The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), does not include any patient rights language, and does not ask how the patient would like to receive their records (mail, electronic, in-person pickup). This is a generic HIPAA authorization form pressed into service for all disclosure scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A single web search returned a direct link to the PDF on El Centro's WordPress site. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or authentication was encountered. The URL structure (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/...`) is a standard WordPress media path — functional but not linked from a clearly labeled "Medical Records" or "Patient Resources" page. The form appears to date from August 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** (zero interactive form fields). It must be printed and completed by hand — the design uses underscore-line blanks and a "circle one" instruction that are hallmarks of print-era forms. The text layer is present (not a scan), so the content is readable and searchable, but there is no digital-first workflow available.

**Field count** is modest: patient name, DOB, phone number, the other party's information, reason checkboxes, information-type checkboxes, a sensitive-information acknowledgment, and signature/date fields — roughly 12–15 fields per language. At one page per language, the form is compact and not overwhelming.

**Layout** is functional but dense. Section headers are minimal; the form flows as a single block of content. Language is relatively plain, though legal constructs appear ("I hereby authorize"). A grammatical error exists in both versions regarding re-disclosure language.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Witness signature line**: Present on both English and Spanish versions. HIPAA does not require a witness for authorization forms. While the line appears optional (no mandatory language), its presence may lead staff to enforce it as required, creating an unnecessary barrier.
- **Fee disclosure**: Vague — "I understand that I may be charged for the copies of health records I have requested" — with no specifics about amounts, HIPAA cost-based limits, or dispute processes.
- **90-day expiration**: The authorization defaults to 90 days, which is reasonable for third-party disclosures but irrelevant for patient access requests (which must be fulfilled within 30 days).
- **No delivery format options**: The form does not ask how the patient wants to receive records.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual (English/Spanish)**: Providing a full Spanish translation on the same document is a meaningful accessibility feature for an FQHC serving Houston's predominantly Spanish-speaking communities. This is uncommon and commendable.
- **Compact design**: One page per language avoids the multi-page complexity that discourages completion.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No patient self-access pathway**: The form's entire structure is oriented toward third-party disclosure. A patient exercising their Right of Access is a second-class user.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive fields; purely a print-and-handwrite workflow.
- **Checkbox mismatch**: The Spanish version omits "Billing Records" as a checkbox option, creating a translation inconsistency.

## Overall Assessment

El Centro de Corazón provides a findable, compact, bilingual form — but it is a generic third-party authorization that does not serve patient self-access as a first-class use case. The non-fillable format, lack of patient rights language, ambiguous witness requirement, and vague fee disclosure all contribute to a below-average patient experience. The bilingual design is a genuine bright spot that partially offsets the form's structural shortcomings.
