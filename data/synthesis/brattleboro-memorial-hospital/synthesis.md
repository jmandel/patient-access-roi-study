# Brattleboro Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, an independent nonprofit community hospital in Brattleboro, Vermont, publishes three ROI-related forms on its website. All three are general-purpose HIPAA disclosure authorization forms designed primarily for releasing records to or from third parties. None is a dedicated patient access request form. The most current version — form-1.pdf, dated January 2025 — serves as the primary pathway for any patient requesting their own records, though patients must navigate a third-party-oriented workflow to do so.

## Access Pathway

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three forms use a FROM/TO structure designed for transfers between parties. A patient requesting their own records would need to select the "Personal Records" purpose checkbox (available only on form-1 and form-3, not form-2) and enter their own name in the "TO" field — a workable but unintuitive approach. There is no online portal, patient portal integration, or web-based request wizard. The hospital's HIM Department lists a phone number (802-257-8258) and fax number (802-257-8881) on the form header, providing fax as an electronic submission channel, though the form itself never explicitly states how to submit it.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was easy. Standard web searches immediately returned direct PDF links hosted on the hospital's WordPress site. No login, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. However, the three overlapping forms are published without any landing page, version guidance, or indication of which is current. A patient who finds form-2 (older, shorter, with a witness line and 6-month default expiration) gets a materially different experience than one who finds form-1 (updated, more comprehensive, 12-month expiration, no witness line).

## Form Document Quality

**Form-1.pdf** (the best available) is a 2-page flat PDF. Despite retrieval notes suggesting fillable fields, metadata confirms zero interactive form fields — all blanks are underscore lines and text-rendered checkbox characters. Patients must print, handwrite, and submit via fax or physical delivery. The two-page structure is logical (instructions/rights on page 1, data entry on page 2), and required fields are marked with an asterisk convention. However, page 2 is densely packed with FROM/TO fields, purpose checkboxes, record-type checkboxes, verbal communication designees, date ranges, and signature blocks. Some checkbox labels are misaligned across columns. The language mixes plain statements with ALL CAPS instructions and bureaucratic phrasing — Instruction 4, which conditions processing on internal record completeness, is particularly confusing for patients.

The form offers approximately 15 fields for patient completion, a reasonable scope. Record-type checkboxes are comprehensive, covering standard categories plus sensitive information (psychiatric, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, hepatitis) and notably progressive categories (reproductive health care, gender affirming care). Delivery options are limited to "Pick Up" and "Send Out" with no electronic delivery mentioned.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on form-1 (though form-2 includes a witness line that may create perceived barriers). Fees are mentioned vaguely — "in accordance with state and federal law" — without specific amounts or a fee schedule. No response time commitment is stated. The form does not require in-person submission, and fax is available as an electronic submission pathway.

## Notable Strengths

- **Progressive sensitive-information categories**: The January 2025 revision includes Reproductive Health Care and Gender Affirming Care checkboxes — unusually inclusive for a community hospital.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to receive health services" directly addresses a common patient concern.
- **Verbal communication designees**: A dedicated section for authorizing up to three individuals for verbal communication with the hospital goes beyond typical ROI forms.
- **Easy online availability**: Forms are publicly accessible without any barriers to download.

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: All forms funnel patients through a generic third-party disclosure workflow.
- **Non-fillable PDF**: The primary form cannot be completed digitally despite its digitally-authored appearance.
- **Multiple unversioned forms**: Three overlapping documents with no guidance creates confusion.
- **No electronic delivery options**: Only physical pickup or mail for receiving records.
- **No explicit submission instructions**: Fax and phone numbers are listed but the form never tells patients how to submit it.

## Overall Assessment

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital provides an adequate but unexceptional records request experience. The forms are easy to find and free of egregious barriers, and the January 2025 update shows thoughtfulness around sensitive health categories. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, non-fillable form format, and absence of electronic delivery options place the hospital behind peers who have modernized their records request processes. The overall experience earns a **C grade** — functional but not patient-centered.
