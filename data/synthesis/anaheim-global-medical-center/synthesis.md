# Anaheim Global Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Anaheim Global Medical Center (AGMC), a for-profit community hospital in Anaheim, CA operated by KPC Health, offers patients a notably difficult path to requesting their own medical records. The hospital publishes no downloadable ROI or authorization form on its website. Instead, patients are directed to a third-party portal (ChartRequest) that requires account creation before a records request can even be viewed or submitted. The only document of privacy relevance available on the website is a Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP) from 2016 — which, while informative, is not a request form and cannot be used to initiate a records request.

## Available Forms and Pathways

**Only one document was retrieved**: the Notice of Privacy Practices (form-1.pdf), an 8-page informational document. It is not an ROI or authorization form. No other PDF forms — neither patient access request forms, third-party authorization forms, nor fee schedules — were found on the AGMC website or on any sister KPC Health facility site.

The **primary pathway** for records requests is the ChartRequest portal at `https://app.chartrequest.com/m/KPC-locations`. This is a system-wide portal used across all KPC Health facilities. It requires account creation (sign-up with login credentials) before a patient can submit a request. This is a meaningful barrier: a patient cannot even preview the request process or see what information is needed without first registering with a commercial third-party vendor.

The NPP references an internal "record request form" available from the Hospital Privacy Office, but this form is not published online and apparently must be obtained in person or by phone — an opaque process that the website does not explain.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

AGMC does **not** clearly differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The ChartRequest portal appears to handle all records requests generically, and the NPP makes no distinction between a patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access and a third party requesting records under an authorization. There is no dedicated patient access form or streamlined self-access process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding records request information for AGMC was **hard**. The search was complicated by name confusion with AHMC Anaheim Regional Medical Center (a different hospital system). After clarifying the parent system (KPC Health), comprehensive searches of the website, web searches for KPC Health authorization forms, and a full PDF scan of the site all came up empty. The only actionable link — "Access Medical Records" on the Patient & Family Resources page — redirects to the ChartRequest portal with no intermediary explanation.

## Form Document Quality

Since no actual ROI form was retrieved, form quality assessment is limited. The NPP (form-1.pdf) is a digitally-created PDF with a text layer, but has **zero fillable fields** — even the signature and date lines at the end are static text. The document is densely written legal prose with 100+ word sentences and nested parentheticals. It follows a logical Roman-numeral structure and is reasonably organized for a legal document, but it is not patient-friendly. A rendering defect ("Page !1", "Page !2") in every page footer suggests limited quality review. The document is severely outdated (2016), predating the 21st Century Cures Act and recent HIPAA enforcement guidance.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No downloadable form**: The most significant barrier is the complete absence of a downloadable authorization or request form. Patients cannot begin the process without either visiting the Privacy Office or creating an account on a third-party portal.
- **Account creation required**: The ChartRequest portal gates access behind registration, adding friction and potentially deterring patients.
- **Outdated NPP**: The 2016 NPP makes no mention of electronic health information, information blocking, or rights under the Cures Act.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The NPP mentions "reasonable cost of copies" without specifying amounts.

## Bright Spots

- The NPP correctly cites 45 C.F.R. § 164.524 (patient access) and § 164.528 (accounting of disclosures).
- Breach notification commitment of 5 business days is substantially faster than the HIPAA-required 60 days.
- Comprehensive coverage of California-specific privacy protections.
- The ChartRequest portal, while requiring registration, does at least provide an electronic submission pathway — patients are not limited to physical mail or in-person delivery.

## Overall Assessment

AGMC scores poorly on patient-centeredness and findability. A patient attempting to request their own records online faces a frustrating experience: no form to download, no clear instructions, and a mandatory account creation with a third-party vendor. The absence of any ROI form — not even a generic HIPAA authorization — is unusual and represents a significant gap. The organization's reliance on an outdated NPP as its only published privacy document, combined with the opaque ChartRequest portal, suggests that patient self-access to records is not a priority. While the electronic submission pathway (ChartRequest) prevents the worst-case scenario of requiring physical delivery, the overall experience falls well below what patients should expect.
