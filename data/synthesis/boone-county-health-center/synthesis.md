# Boone County Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Boone County Health Center (BCHC) is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Albion, Nebraska. The organization provides a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all records release requests — there is no dedicated patient self-access pathway. Three documents were found: the current ROI form (form-2), a superseded 2017 version (form-1), and a HIPAA Contact Information form (form-3) that is explicitly not an ROI substitute.

## Available Pathways and Primary Form

The primary and only ROI form is form-2, "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information," uploaded in February 2026 as a Microsoft Word .docx file. This replaced an older PDF version (form-1, August 2017) that remains accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the website. The current form is a generic authorization that handles both outbound release ("Release Information To") and inbound record requests ("Obtain Records From") through a single check-one mechanism. While a "Patient Request" purpose checkbox exists, the form does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party authorization, and makes no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — basic web searches surfaced both the old and new versions, and the current form is listed on the Patient Forms section under Patient Resources > General Information. The main complication is that the current form is published only as a .docx file, which is unusual and less accessible than PDF. The website also requires JavaScript rendering to display form links. Retrieval difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a 2-page document with a logical flow: patient identification, release direction, purpose, date range, record types, sensitive information authorization, delivery format, legal acknowledgments, and signatures. It has zero fillable fields — all inputs are underscore blank lines, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The .docx format theoretically allows typing, but without proper form fields the experience is poor.

The layout is reasonably organized with clear sections, though the release direction framing ("Release Information To" vs. "Obtain Records From") is confusing for patients who simply want their own records. The sensitive information section has garbled instruction text from formatting issues. Language is generally plain and accessible, with concise legal acknowledgments. There are no instructions explaining how to submit the completed form, though the header provides phone, fax, and a dedicated ROI email address (Roi@boonecohealth.org).

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization is required. Fee disclosure is vague — the form states "copy fees may apply in accordance with Nebraska law" without specifying amounts or distinguishing between patient-access and third-party fees. A photo ID/witness requirement appears on the signature line but its scope is ambiguous — it may apply only to in-person pickup. The form includes a proper non-coercion statement, re-disclosure warning, 12-month fixed expiration, and revocation rights. No turnaround time is stated. A typo ("Heath" instead of "Health") appears in the legal section.

Submission methods include fax (402-395-2180), potentially email (Roi@boonecohealth.org is listed but not explicitly stated as a submission channel), mail, and in-person delivery. Fax availability means electronic submission is possible without visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

BCHC shows several bright spots unusual for a small critical access hospital: a dedicated ROI email address suggesting a staffed intake process, encrypted email as a delivery format option, and careful handling of sensitive information categories with separate initials required for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV/AIDS records per Nebraska law. The form is compact (2 pages) and avoids excessive legalese.

## Notable Weaknesses

The .docx-only publication format is a meaningful accessibility barrier. The lack of fillable fields means this is fundamentally a paper workflow. The generic authorization framing without any acknowledgment of patient access rights under HIPAA means a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for third-party release. The continued availability of the superseded 2017 form at its original URL creates confusion risk.

## Overall Assessment

Boone County Health Center provides a functional but unremarkable records request process. The form is findable and the content is adequate, but it reflects a traditional paper-centric approach with no digital-first design or patient access differentiation. The bright spots — dedicated email, encrypted delivery, compact design — show genuine effort, but the .docx format, lack of fillable fields, and generic authorization framing hold back the overall experience. A patient can get the job done, but must figure out the process largely on their own.
