# U.S. Dermatology Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides a single ROI form — "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — available as a one-page PDF from their Patient Forms page. Two copies were found online: form-1.pdf (uploaded March 2020, currently linked) and form-2.pdf (uploaded June 2019, orphaned but still publicly accessible). Both contain identical text, with a revision footer of "Rev 08/2017," indicating the content has not been substantively updated in nearly nine years. For patient self-access purposes, form-1.pdf is the relevant document.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Instead, it uses a generic HIPAA authorization form that bundles patient self-access with third-party release scenarios. "Patient Access" appears as one checkbox among five under "Purpose of Use/Disclosure," alongside "To Doctor," "To Insurance," "To Attorney," and "Other." The overall framing — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure" — is oriented toward third-party release, and a patient requesting their own records must navigate a form structure designed for a different purpose. For example, the recipient section asks for "Name of individual or organization" and its address, which is confusing when the patient is requesting records for themselves. The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for the organization name plus "medical records release form" surfaced the PDF directly, and the Patient Forms page at `usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/` has a clearly labeled "Medical Records Release" link. No bot blocking, login wall, or browser fallback was needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields** (`fillable_field_count: 0`), requiring patients to print, hand-fill, and physically sign. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow with clear sections for patient identification, disclosure direction, delivery method, purpose, date range, record types, and rights disclosures. Language is somewhat legalistic but generally readable. The form lacks instructions on where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, or email is provided.

## Delivery and Submission

The form lists three delivery options for records: mailed, faxed, or electronic (patient portal only). However, these describe how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself is *submitted*. The form is silent on submission method, leaving patients without guidance. Given the lack of submission instructions and the non-fillable PDF, the workflow is effectively: download → print → hand-fill → unknown submission. The patient forms page and general website would likely require calling the office to determine where to send it; fax is presumably available once the patient contacts the office.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No submission instructions**: The most significant usability gap. A patient who completes the form has no idea where to send it.
- **Blanket liability waiver**: The form requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure," bundled into the authorization with no opt-out. This is overreaching for patient self-access requests.
- **Vague fee language**: "A reasonable fee may be charged for the records" does not distinguish patient-access requests (HIPAA-limited) from third-party releases, and gives no indication of actual costs.
- **Typo**: "IDS" instead of "AIDS" in the sensitive information disclosure — uncorrected since 2017.
- **No response time commitment**: No mention of turnaround time or the 30-day HIPAA requirement.
- **Not fillable**: Zero interactive fields despite being a digitally created PDF.

## Bright Spots

- **Single-page brevity**: The entire authorization fits on one page without being cramped — a respectful use of patient time.
- **Clear voluntariness statement**: "I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment" is unambiguous and well-placed.
- **Easy online findability**: Directly linked from a well-organized Patient Forms page with clear labeling.
- **Patient rights disclosures**: Five bullet points covering right to a copy, right to inspect, right to revoke, voluntariness, and sensitive information notice.

## Overall Assessment

U.S. Dermatology Partners provides an easily findable, concise ROI form that technically accommodates patient self-access through a checkbox — but the form is fundamentally a third-party authorization repurposed for all disclosure scenarios. The lack of fillable fields, missing submission instructions, bundled liability waiver, and vague fee language collectively create a paper-era experience with notable friction points. The form has not been meaningfully updated since 2017. A patient can likely get their records through this process, but the organization has not designed the experience around patient self-access as a first-class use case.
