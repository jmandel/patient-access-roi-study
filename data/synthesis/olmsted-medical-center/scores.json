    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Fillable PDF with 62 interactive fields allows complete digital form-filling; loses one point because submission still requires fax, mail, or in-person delivery — no fully online submission workflow (rubric level 4: mostly digital with one gap in the workflow)."

      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Single-page form with clear section headers, logical flow, granular record-type checkboxes, and reasonable field count; minor issues include the intimidating 'this is a legal document' opener, two typos, and unexplained 'limitations may apply' qualifiers (rubric level 4: well-organized with minor clarity issues)."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Generic authorization form not designed for patient self-access — patients must figure out to put their own name in the 'To' field and select 'Personal' as reason; however, the form is usable for this purpose and includes a CFR 164.524 reference and non-conditioning statement (rubric level 3: patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them)."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "No notarization, no mandatory in-person submission, clear revocation rights, explicit right-of-access citation, and non-conditioning statement; minor ambiguities about delivery 'limitations' and no fee disclosure prevent a 5 (rubric level 4: minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding)."
