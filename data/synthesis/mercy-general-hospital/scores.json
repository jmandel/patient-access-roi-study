    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Both patient access forms have zero fillable fields, requiring a print-and-handwrite workflow; the hospital form (form-3) provides only mailing addresses for submission, making this primarily a paper workflow despite form-2 listing fax/email contact info for the medical group department."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Forms are organized with lettered sections and checkboxes at an appropriate 2-page length, but form-3 has severe font encoding corruption impairing screen reader accessibility, the date range is framed as 'hospitalization' rather than general dates, and fee amounts are undisclosed."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Dedicated patient access forms exist and are clearly separated from third-party authorization, but the dual-track structure requires patients to determine hospital vs. medical group, physician gatekeeping provisions undermine patient autonomy, and no patient rights statement is included on either access form."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Physician approval requirements for patient access to own HIV and psychiatric records likely exceed HIPAA Right of Access limits; the physician notification/veto mechanism on form-3 creates an illegitimate barrier; no appeal rights or reviewing professional process disclosed as required by 45 CFR § 164.524(d)(4)."
