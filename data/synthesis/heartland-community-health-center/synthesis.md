# Heartland Community Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Heartland Community Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Lawrence, Kansas, serving patients across three locations. The organization provides a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" — for all records requests. There is no dedicated patient self-access pathway distinct from third-party release.

## Forms & Pathways

Only one form was found: a single-page PDF titled "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" (form-1.pdf), hosted in the organization's WordPress uploads directory. This form serves all release purposes — patient access, provider-to-provider transfers, insurance disputes, and referrals. A "Patient's Request" checkbox appears among the purpose options, but the form's structure (with "Records From" and "Records To" fields) is oriented around third-party transfer rather than individual access. A patient requesting records for personal use would find it unclear how to complete the "Records To" section.

Submission options are reasonable: email (medrecords@heartlandhealth.org), fax (785-856-0375), and mail. A phone line for questions (785-842-4477, Option 5) is also provided. These multiple channels meet the baseline for adequate electronic submission.

## Retrieval Experience

The form was not discoverable through generic web searches but was found via a site-scoped search (`site:heartlandhealth.org`). The URL is descriptive and the download was straightforward once located. The form is not prominently linked from obvious patient-facing pages — it lives in a WordPress uploads directory, suggesting it may be embedded on an interior page but is not surfaced in primary navigation or a patient resources section.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a digitally-created, single-page PDF with a full text layer — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being born-digital, it functions as a print-and-handwrite document. The layout is logically ordered (demographics → record types → delivery method → from/to → purpose → legal disclosures → signature → return instructions) and fits everything onto a single page, though the density is high with 16 fonts and tight spacing.

The form uses approximately 20+ data entry points (name, DOB, address, phones, date ranges, multiple checkbox groups, records from/to blocks, signature lines). The opening line — "To treat you effectively, your provider needs to review your past medical records" — is patient-friendly, though it subtly frames the form around incoming records transfer rather than patient-initiated access.

One notable design feature is the pre-bundled "Record Set" option, which offers a thoughtfully curated default bundle (last 3 visit notes, recent labs, medication list, immunization records, screening reports, and specialist list). This reduces decision burden for patients who want comprehensive records.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Witness requirement**: A "Witness" signature line is present but never explicitly stated as required. Its inclusion may deter patients or create confusion about whether a witness is actually needed.

**Mental health records**: These require a completely separate form and cannot be combined with other record types on the same submission, creating an additional barrier for patients seeking comprehensive records.

**Email liability disclaimers**: Two separate liability waivers for email delivery appear on the form, which may discourage patients from choosing this convenient option.

**Fees**: No fees are mentioned anywhere on the form — neither disclosed nor waived.

**Compliance language**: The form properly addresses revocation rights, 12-month expiration, treatment non-conditioning, and re-disclosure warnings. However, it does not reference the patient's Right of Access under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Overall Assessment

Heartland Community Health Center provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The form is accessible online (with some searching), offers multiple submission channels, and includes some patient-friendly elements like the pre-bundled record set and plain-language opening. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic third-party release framing, the ambiguous witness requirement, and the absence of any dedicated patient access pathway all work against patient-centeredness. The form is adequate for its purpose but was not designed with patient self-access as a primary use case. For an FQHC serving a population that may face literacy or technology barriers, the non-fillable format and dense layout represent meaningful obstacles.
