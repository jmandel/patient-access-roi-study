    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: primarily a paper workflow — despite being a born-digital PDF with a text layer, it has zero fillable fields, requiring patients to print and handwrite; submission can be done electronically (email/fax) but the form itself demands a paper step."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: well-organized with minor issues — the form has a logical flow, clear section ordering, a helpful pre-bundled record set option, and plain-language opening, but is very dense for a single page and the mental health records restriction adds confusion."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: patient self-access is an afterthought — the form is a generic third-party release authorization with 'Records From/To' fields designed for transfers, not individual access; 'Patient's Request' is merely one checkbox among several purpose options with no dedicated pathway."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — the ambiguous witness signature line could be interpreted as a barrier, no fees are disclosed or waived, no Right of Access reference is included, but revocation rights and treatment non-conditioning are properly stated."
