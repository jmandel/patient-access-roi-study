# Emory University Hospital — Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways

Emory University Hospital, part of the Emory Healthcare system, offers four documents on its medical records page: a current English ROI authorization form (form-1, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), a legacy 4-page ROI package (form-2, ~September 2022), a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3, fillable PDF, revised November 2025), and a Request for Amendment form (form-4). The primary form for a patient requesting records is form-1, the current English authorization. Emory also provides a Swellbox/Datavant online records request wizard as an alternative digital pathway.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Emory does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release authorization. The primary form is a generic "Authorization for the Release of Protected Health Information" used for all release scenarios — patients requesting their own records, attorneys, insurers, and other third parties all use the same document. However, the form does include "At my request" as a named purpose option, and its delivery methods include MyChart and EHI Export, signaling awareness that patients are a key audience. A patient requesting their own records must fill themselves in as the recipient, navigating a form framework designed around the third-party release paradigm. The Swellbox portal offers a somewhat more guided digital alternative, but the overall process does not clearly distinguish HIPAA Right of Access requests from general authorization-based releases.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A targeted web search for Emory Healthcare medical records forms surfaced the PDF URL directly, and the medical records page at `emoryhealthcare.org/patients-visitors/medical-records` is well-organized with clear links to all relevant documents — English and Spanish authorization forms, fee sheets, e-delivery instructions, amendment form, and the Swellbox portal. No bot blocking was encountered, and no browser fallback was needed. The descriptive filename convention (`english-authorization-form-fillable-revised-11-2025.pdf`) is a small but meaningful usability detail. One minor issue: the URL path includes a `/wr/` segment (likely referencing the Warner Robins facility), which could confuse patients at other Emory locations.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a genuinely fillable 2-page PDF with approximately 100 interactive fields (checkboxes and text inputs), though the PDF's AES-256 encryption caused metadata tools to report zero fillable fields. The form is organized into numbered sections covering facility selection (18+ Emory Healthcare locations), recipient and delivery information, record type specification (17+ granular checkboxes with date fields), and purpose. The layout is clean and logical. Language is a mix of clear structural labels and moderately dense legal text on page 2 (revocation rights, re-disclosure warnings, sensitive information waiver). The form is not tagged for screen reader accessibility.

A notable strength is the range of delivery options: paper, CD, USB drive, MyChart, mail, pick-up, e-delivery website, email, and — remarkably — **EHI Export**, a forward-thinking option that very few organizations surface on their authorization forms. The Spanish-language version (form-3) mirrors the English structure, though it has character encoding issues (accented characters rendering as digits) and incomplete translation of institutional terms.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. No in-person submission requirement exists — patients can fax or use the Swellbox portal. The primary form does not disclose fees directly; a separate fee sheet ($6.50 flat for electronic delivery, $0.07/page for paper) is available on the medical records page. The legacy form-2 required a separate fee acknowledgment signature, but the current form-1 does not. The form does include a blanket waiver for sensitive information (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health) that does not allow patients to opt out of releasing specific sensitive categories — a common but patient-unfriendly approach.

## Overall Assessment

Emory Healthcare provides a competent, well-organized records request process with several standout features — particularly the EHI Export delivery option, the Spanish-language form, and the Swellbox online portal. The forms are easy to find, fillable, and recently updated. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must use the same generic authorization form as third-party requesters, without clear guidance on how to request their own records specifically. The form accommodates patient requests but was not designed around them as a first-class use case. This is a solid B-level experience — functional, accessible, and well-maintained, but not yet patient-centered in its design philosophy.
