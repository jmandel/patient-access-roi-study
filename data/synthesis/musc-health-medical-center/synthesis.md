# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

MUSC Health University Medical Center in Charleston, SC is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina health system. The organization provides three pathways for patients to request their medical records: a downloadable PDF authorization form, MyChart patient portal, and an online Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool. Three documents were retrieved: the English authorization form (form-1), a MyChart instructional guide (form-2), and a Spanish-language authorization form (form-3).

## Access Pathway Assessment

MUSC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary pathway is a generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form that serves both patient access and third-party release scenarios. A patient requesting their own records must navigate the same "Release Records From" / "Release Records To" framework designed for third-party disclosures, filling in their own name as both patient and recipient — an unintuitive experience. The form includes "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" as one of eight purpose-of-release checkboxes, but patient self-access is not called out as a distinct pathway.

However, MUSC partially compensates by offering the MyChart portal pathway, where patients can submit records requests electronically. The MyChart guide (form-2) describes a step-by-step process for requesting records within the portal, though it prominently warns about fees and a prepayment requirement. The Ciox/Swellbox eRequest tool is a third option but requires webcam identity verification, adding friction.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A standard web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF URL at a clean, descriptive path (`muschealth.org/-/sm/health/medical-records/f/authorization-to-disclose-phi.pdf`). The medical records landing page links directly to the form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered. The Spanish version was similarly accessible at a predictable URL. This is a model of straightforward form availability.

## Form Document Quality

The primary English authorization form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. All blanks are static underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a significant shortcoming given that the form offers modern delivery options like encrypted email and MyChart. The form was clearly designed digitally (9 fonts, clean layout) but not built for digital completion.

The layout follows a logical progression: patient demographics → records source/destination → record types → purpose → date range → delivery method → legal disclosures → signature. The record-type options are well-designed, including a helpfully defined "Abstract" option. Five delivery methods are offered (mail, MyChart, fax, encrypted email, other) — above average for ROI forms. However, page 1 is dense, with legal disclosures compressed into a wall of small-print text at the bottom.

Language is a mix of plain instructions and legal/regulatory terminology. The opening warning ("FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION") is clear but intimidating. Rights disclosures reference specific CFR sections, which is appropriate but not patient-friendly.

## Barriers and Concerns

Several barriers exist. The form requires a **witness signature** — a line with no explanation of when or whether it's required, likely confusing patients into thinking it's always mandatory. HIPAA does not require a witness for patient access requests. The form also requires attaching **a copy of patient identification** for all requests, not just representative requests — an extra step that adds friction for patients without easy copier access. The request for the **last 4 digits of SSN** is unnecessary for patient identification and may deter some patients.

The fee situation is a notable red flag. The MyChart instructional guide explicitly states that fees apply to "all patient requests released to the patient" including "search and duplication" — HIPAA only permits reasonable cost-based fees (not search fees) for patient access requests. The guide also describes a **prepayment requirement** before records are released, which may conflict with HHS/OCR guidance on patient access rights.

## Bright Spots

MUSC demonstrates genuine effort in several areas. The **Spanish-language form** (form-3) is a full professional translation preserving the complete structure and content of the English original, with bilingual headers — uncommon among organizations in this study. **Multiple pathways** (PDF, MyChart, Ciox eRequest) give patients genuine choice. **Multiple delivery methods** including encrypted email show digital awareness. The **multi-facility contact directory** on page 2 provides complete information for 9 MUSC locations, and the form explicitly references **45 CFR §164.524** (right to inspect/copy), making HIPAA rights visible to patients.

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health earns a **B grade** overall. The organization makes forms easy to find, offers multiple request pathways and delivery options, provides a Spanish-language version, and includes patient rights language. However, the generic third-party authorization form is not designed around patient self-access, the PDF lacks fillable fields despite digital distribution, and the fee/prepayment language raises compliance concerns. The witness signature and blanket ID requirements add unnecessary barriers. A dedicated patient access form with fillable fields and clearer fee disclosures would meaningfully improve the patient experience.
