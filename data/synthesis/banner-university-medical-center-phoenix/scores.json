    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Primarily a paper workflow — the PDF has zero fillable fields, requiring patients to print, handwrite all fields, and sign by hand; fax submission is available but the form itself offers no digital completion capability."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — the form has clear section headers, logical flow, and granular record-type selection, but the opening paragraph about third-party directives is dense regulatory jargon and there is a grammatical error in the exclusion instructions."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form is a generic authorization for all releases with a 'Self' checkbox option, but does not distinguish patient access rights from third-party release; the portal callout is helpful but the form itself is not patient-access-specific."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing that would materially impede a patient — the form correctly states non-conditioning of treatment, right to revoke, and right to a copy, but the fee disclosure is vague and the broad liability waiver goes beyond HIPAA requirements."

      "grade": "C",
      "summary": "Banner Health provides easily findable and well-maintained forms with good content design, but the non-fillable PDF, generic authorization pathway, and vague fee disclosure keep it in the average range for patient experience."
