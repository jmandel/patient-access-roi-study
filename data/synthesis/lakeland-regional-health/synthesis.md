# Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center provides three downloadable documents, but only one is relevant for patient self-access: **form-3.pdf**, the current "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" (CONS00337, dated LRH 01/22). This single-page PDF is linked from the organization's [Medical Records page](https://www.mylrh.org/medical-records/) and is the actively maintained ROI form. An older version of the same form (form-1.pdf, dated 04/16) remains publicly accessible at a separate URL but is no longer linked from the site. The third document (form-2.pdf) is an LRH Physicians Group Release/Authorization Form — a multi-purpose intake/consent bundle covering insurance assignment, billing, and treatment consent — and is not a patient-initiated records request form.

In addition to the PDF form, the organization offers a **Swellbox digital intake wizard** (http://www.swellbox.com/lakeland-wizard.html) as an alternative electronic pathway, which is a meaningful digital option for patients who prefer not to deal with paper.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Lakeland Regional Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form (form-3) is a generic HIPAA authorization with bidirectional language — "to disclose my PHI to" and "to obtain my PHI from" — using checkboxes for each direction. A patient requesting their own records must figure out that they should check "to disclose my PHI to" and enter their own name and address as the recipient, an unintuitive workflow. There is no dedicated patient access form, no simplified request pathway, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). The form treats patient self-access identically to third-party release, including applying the same fee structure.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A web search for Lakeland Regional Health medical records release form returned direct PDF links immediately, and the Medical Records page is straightforward to locate via site navigation. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor concern is that the superseded 2016 version remains publicly accessible without any "outdated" marking, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-3) is a **clean, digitally-authored single-page PDF** with a full text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**: all blanks are underscore lines requiring print-and-handwrite completion. The layout is logical and reasonably organized, flowing from patient identification through recipient details, date range, delivery method, record type checkboxes (13 categories plus "Other"), sensitive information notice, five legal clauses, and signature blocks. The language is a mix of plain English and legal terminology — the numbered "I understand that..." clauses are reasonably accessible, though the fee reference to Florida statutes without disclosing actual amounts is opaque.

Three delivery options are offered: Paper, Electronic (email), and MyChart Patient Portal — a forward-thinking inclusion. The form provides granular record-type selection with 13 specific categories, and includes a patient-protective redaction option for mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records.

## Barriers

**Fee disclosure** is a notable weakness: patients must "agree to pay charges... per Florida Statute 395.3025 or Florida Administrative Code 64B8-10.003" without knowing what those charges are. This state fee schedule reference may exceed HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests, and the form makes no distinction between patient access and third-party release fee structures.

A **witness signature line** appears on the form without clear indication of whether it is required or optional. If required, this creates a logistical barrier for patients completing the form at home or remotely. The form also collects the **last four digits of SSN**, which is unnecessary when MRN, name, DOB, and address are already requested. A "Photo ID verified" checkbox is ambiguous — if interpreted as requiring in-person ID presentation, it could conflict with electronic submission.

## Bright Spots

- **Swellbox digital intake** provides a fully electronic alternative pathway
- **MyChart Patient Portal** as a delivery option leverages existing infrastructure
- **Granular record-type selection** (13 categories) gives patients meaningful control
- **Sensitive information redaction option** with explicit notice is a patient-protective feature
- **Single-page conciseness** keeps the form efficient and reduces patient burden

## Overall Assessment

Lakeland Regional Health provides a **serviceable but undifferentiated** records request experience. The form is easy to find, concise, and reasonably well-organized, with some genuinely patient-friendly features (granular record selection, redaction option, MyChart delivery). However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic authorization form not designed for individual access, failing to disclose fees, and including potentially unnecessary requirements (witness, partial SSN). The availability of Swellbox as a digital alternative partially compensates for the non-fillable PDF, but the core form experience remains paper-first. The organization earns credit for accessibility and findability but loses ground on patient-centeredness and compliance nuances.
