    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds; fax submission available — the PDF has a text layer but zero fillable fields requiring print-and-handwrite, though the Swellbox digital portal and fax provide electronic submission options."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity or length issues — single-page form with logical flow, granular record selection, and reasonable language, but fee clause references statutes without disclosing amounts and bidirectional authorization language is unintuitive for patients."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — generic HIPAA authorization form with no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release, requiring patients to figure out which checkboxes apply and enter their own name as recipient."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements or language that may go beyond what the law requires for patient access — witness signature line may create an unnecessary barrier, fee clause cites state statutes that may exceed HIPAA cost-based limits for patient access, and partial SSN collection is unnecessary."
