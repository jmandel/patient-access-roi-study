# Esse Health — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Esse Health is an independent, for-profit physician practice based in St. Louis, Missouri. Two documents were retrieved from their patient forms page: an Authorization for Release of Medical Information (form-1.pdf) and a communication/message authorization (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is relevant for a patient requesting their own health records. Notably, Esse Health also offers a DocuSign-based electronic submission pathway for the same ROI form, which meaningfully improves the overall patient experience.

## Access Pathway

Esse Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The single ROI form (form-1.pdf) is a generic HIPAA authorization with "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED BY" and "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED TO" fields — a structure designed for records transfers between providers or releases to attorneys, insurers, and other third parties. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. There is no dedicated patient access request form, no separate section for individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient requesting their own records has different rights than a third party requesting records on someone's behalf.

The form does cite 45 CFR 164.524 (the HIPAA right of access provision), which is a positive signal, but this is buried in a dense paragraph of legal language rather than presented as guidance for patients. The availability of a DocuSign electronic submission option is a genuine bright spot — it allows patients to complete and submit the form digitally without printing, scanning, or visiting the office.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF URL, and the patient forms page at `essehealth.com/patient-center/patient-forms/` is well-organized with clear labeling under "General Forms." No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The retrieval was rated **easy**. One minor issue: the communication authorization form (form-2) has "Medical Records" in its website title, which could mislead a patient looking for the actual records release form.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally-created PDF. While the metadata reports 28 fillable field annotations, the field names array is empty, suggesting the fields may not be properly configured for interactive use. The form relies on underline blanks — it was designed primarily as a print-and-write document. However, the DocuSign alternative compensates significantly by providing a fully interactive digital pathway.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification, release from/to fields, 11 record-type checkboxes, sensitive information disclosure, revocation and expiration language, and signature. The language is a mix of plain English and moderate legalese — the opening authorization statement is clear, but the disclosure paragraphs covering HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse are denser. At one page, the form is appropriately concise without being cramped.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signature is required. The form states that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment. It provides a six-month default expiration and a revocation mechanism, though the revocation language ("present my written cancellation to the health information management department") is ambiguous about whether this can be done remotely. Fee disclosure is vague — "there may be a charge associated with copying my health information" — with no specifics about amounts or HIPAA's cost-based limits. No delivery format options (electronic, paper, mail, pick-up) are mentioned, which is a gap for patient self-access scenarios. Submission options include the DocuSign electronic pathway, making electronic submission available.

## Overall Assessment

Esse Health provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The key strength is the DocuSign electronic submission option, which elevates the experience above many peers by enabling end-to-end digital completion and submission. The key weakness is the lack of any differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release — the generic authorization form forces patients to navigate a process not designed for them. The form itself is clean and concise but not interactive, and the fee disclosure is vague. For an independent physician practice, this represents a middle-of-the-road effort: the form is easy to find and usable, but the organization has not invested in a patient-centered access pathway.
