# La Clínica de La Raza — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

La Clínica de La Raza is an independent, nonprofit FQHC serving the East Bay community in Oakland, CA. Of the three documents collected during the retrieval process, **none is an actual ROI or records-request form from this organization.** Forms 1 and 2 were retrieved from La Clinica Health Centers in Medford, Oregon — a completely different organization whose similar name caused persistent search-engine confusion. Only form-3, a Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), actually belongs to La Clínica de La Raza, and it is an informational document rather than a request form.

## Access Pathway

La Clínica de La Raza does **not** offer a clear, patient-facing pathway for requesting medical records online. There is no dedicated patient access form, no generic ROI form, and no portal-based request wizard on their website. The only guidance appears in the 8-page NPP (FORM 8092, effective October 2012), which instructs patients to "write us at the contact address at the end of this notice" — a P.O. Box:

> La Clínica de La Raza, Inc.  
> Attention: Privacy Officer  
> P.O. Box 22210, Oakland, CA 94623

No fax number, email address, or online submission option is provided for record requests. The organization does use OCHIN's MyChart patient portal, but the NPP does not direct patients to use it for records access. The practical result is that a patient's only documented pathway is to compose a letter — with no form to structure their request and no guidance on what information to include — and mail it to a P.O. Box.

The organization does not differentiate individual access from third-party release, because it provides no release-of-information process at all on its public website.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval difficulty was **hard — effectively no form found online.** Multiple search strategies were exhausted: filetype-specific Google searches, manual website navigation, URL guessing against common WordPress upload patterns, and Wayback Machine checks. Every search either returned nothing or surfaced forms from the similarly-named Oregon organization. The laclinica.org website has no "Medical Records," "Forms," or "Release of Information" section. The only patient-facing documents published are the NPP (in English, Spanish, and Chinese), a Rights and Responsibilities page, and a sliding fee schedule.

## Form Document Quality

Because no ROI form exists online, there is no form to evaluate for document quality. The NPP — the only relevant document — is a standard 8-page legal notice with zero fillable fields. Its text layer is present but degraded by extraction artifacts (bullet points rendering as "c", scattered watermark fragments like "EW", "O N", "LY", "VI"). The document is over 13 years old (effective October 2012), predating the 2013 HIPAA Omnibus Rule and 2016 CURES Act.

## Barriers

- **No downloadable form**: The most significant barrier. Patients have no structured way to submit a records request without first contacting the organization by phone or in person to obtain a form.
- **Postal mail only**: The NPP's instructions direct patients to write to a P.O. Box — no fax, email, or online option is mentioned for record requests.
- **Vague fee language**: The NPP states "We may charge you a fee for the copies" without amounts or a fee schedule, leaving patients uncertain about costs.
- **No guidance on request content**: The NPP does not specify what a records request letter should include (name, DOB, date range, record types, preferred format).
- **Outdated document**: A 2012 NPP may not reflect current regulatory requirements or organizational practices.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual NPP**: The Notice of Privacy Practices is published in English, Spanish, and Chinese, reflecting the linguistic diversity of the FQHC's patient population.
- **Electronic format right acknowledged**: The NPP explicitly mentions the right to receive PHI in electronic format and to direct copies to a designated third party — a HITECH Act requirement that some organizations omit.
- **Approachable tone**: The NPP uses "we/you" language and ends with a gracious "We thank you for entrusting your health care to us."

## Overall Assessment

La Clínica de La Raza represents one of the most difficult access scenarios in this study. An FQHC serving a predominantly low-income, multilingual community provides no online pathway for patients to request their own records. The absence of any downloadable form — combined with a mail-only process described only within a dense, outdated 8-page privacy notice — creates a meaningful barrier to exercising HIPAA access rights. While the organization does not impose illegitimate requirements like notarization or excessive fees, the sheer absence of an accessible process is itself a significant patient-access failure.
