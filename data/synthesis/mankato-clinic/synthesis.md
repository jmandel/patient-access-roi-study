# Mankato Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Mankato Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Mankato, Minnesota. Two PDF forms were found — both versions of the same "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" document (form MC032). Form-1 (revised 02/23) is the current version; form-2 (revised 07/20) is a superseded version that remains publicly accessible. The clinic also offers an online medical record request tool and accepts submissions via fax, email, and DocuSign, providing patients with multiple channels beyond the PDF form itself.

## Access Pathway & Patient Self-Access

Mankato Clinic does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. Both forms use a generic two-party structure — "Release my medical records from" (source) and "Share my medical records with" (destination) — requiring a patient who wants their own records to awkwardly list Mankato Clinic as the source and themselves as the destination. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights language, and no indication that patients have a legal right to obtain their records. The form is framed entirely as a release/disclosure authorization.

That said, the clinic does offer an **online medical record request tool** at a separate URL, which may provide a more streamlined patient self-access experience. The ROI page also notes that DocuSign is accepted, and patients can submit signed authorizations by fax (507-388-1878) or email (ROI@mankatoclinic.com). This gives patients practical electronic submission options even though the PDF form itself is print-oriented.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced direct PDF links and the dedicated Release of Information page at `mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/`. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The ROI page provides clear contact information and links to both the PDF form and the online request tool. One minor concern: both the current and superseded form versions remain live with no redirect or deprecation notice, which could confuse patients.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a 2-page digitally authored PDF — page 1 is the authorization, page 2 is a full page of field-by-field instructions. Despite being natively digital, the form has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print, handwrite, and return via fax or mail. The policy that "Mankato Clinic does not accept typed signatures unless a verification program is utilized" reinforces the print-and-sign workflow.

The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → source → destination → record types → reason → signature. Section headers use bolded questions ("WHO HAS INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE RELEASED?") with sidebar labels, creating a clear visual hierarchy. The form-1 revision improved readability by replacing clinical labels ("Health Care Facility / Provider") with plain language ("Release my medical records from"). The 11 record-type checkboxes cover a reasonable range including sensitive categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health/substance abuse). The instruction page is a genuine bright spot — section-by-section guidance that is uncommon and practically useful.

The form is English-only. Field count is moderate (approximately 20 fields including patient demographics, source/destination addresses, checkboxes, and signature). The legal boilerplate is clear and reasonably concise.

## Barriers & Compliance

- **Fees**: Vaguely disclosed — "I understand there may be a charge" with no amounts or schedule. Patients cannot anticipate costs before submitting.
- **Turnaround**: 7–10 business days stated, well within HIPAA's 30-day window.
- **Witness line**: The older form-2 includes a "Witnessed by" line (removed in form-1), which could have been perceived as a barrier.
- **Delivery options**: The form lists physical delivery methods only (given, mailed, faxed, pick up). The older form-2 instructions explicitly state "Medical records are not able to be emailed." No electronic delivery option appears on either form.
- **Authorization expiration**: 12 months with written revocation — standard and compliant.
- **Treatment conditioning**: Properly disclosed with HIPAA-compliant exceptions.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated instruction page** with practical guidance ("We prioritize requests by appointment date")
- **Multiple ROI contact points** — three offices with dedicated phone/fax, plus email
- **Accepts any HIPAA-compliant form**, including the Minnesota Standard Consent Form
- **Online request tool** available as an alternative to the PDF form
- **Modernized plain-language labels** in the current form version

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable fields on a natively digital PDF — an unnecessary friction point
- No differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release
- Vague fee disclosure with no specific amounts
- No mention of patient rights or HIPAA Right of Access
- Two versions of the same form hosted simultaneously without deprecation notice

## Overall Assessment

Mankato Clinic makes its ROI form easy to find and provides multiple submission channels (fax, email, online tool), which removes the most critical access barriers. The form itself is well-organized with an unusually helpful instruction page. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization framing (no patient access pathway differentiation), and vague fee disclosure keep it from excelling. The organization's practical accommodations — multiple contact points, alternative submission methods, acceptance of any HIPAA-compliant form — partially compensate for the form's design limitations.
