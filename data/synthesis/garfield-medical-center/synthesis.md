# Garfield Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Garfield Medical Center (GMC), a for-profit community hospital in Monterey Park, CA, operated by AHMC Healthcare Inc., provides a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URL paths on the AHMC website. Neither form is specifically designed for patient self-access; both are general-purpose "Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information" documents that serve third-party release and personal use alike.

## Access Pathway

GMC does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient requesting their own records must use the same authorization form designed for release to insurers, attorneys, and other third parties. The form includes "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox, and a patient could fill in their own name in the "Release To" field, but the framing is clearly oriented toward third-party disclosure ("I authorize Garfield Medical Center to Release Medical records to: Person/Organization"). There is no online portal, no digital request wizard, and no separate patient access request form.

That said, the form does include an "Inspect or Review Medical Record" option alongside copies, acknowledging the patient's right to review records in person — a positive touch that many facilities omit.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF links with no bot blocking, login requirements, or browser workarounds needed. Both form versions were indexed and accessible via descriptive URLs. The only minor confusion is that two near-identical forms exist at different paths (`/gmc/documents/` and `/gmc/docs/`), both marked "Revised 9/21." A patient discovering both would have no clear way to determine which is authoritative.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a 2-page, digitally-created PDF with a text layer — **not** a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, meaning patients must print and complete it by hand despite its digital origin. This is a significant missed opportunity: the form was clearly authored in a word processor but exported without interactive fields.

The layout is well-organized, following a logical flow: Patient Information → Release To → Purpose → Information to Be Released → Delivery Instructions → Notice of Rights → Term → Signature. Section headers are clear and distinct. The form offers impressive granularity in record type selection (12+ specific categories plus "ALL RECORDS") and provides multiple delivery options including email with a dedicated address field.

Language is generally accessible, using an "I understand that..." format for patient rights. However, legal references to California Health and Safety Code sections are included without plain-language explanation. The opening line — "Failure to provide all information may invalidate this authorization" — sets an intimidating tone, and it is unclear which fields are truly mandatory.

## Barriers & Concerns

- **CD liability waiver bundled into authorization:** All patients must waive liability for CD release as part of signing the form, even when not requesting imaging on CD. This is consent bundling.
- **Fees disclosed without amounts:** The form references California fee statutes but provides no specific costs, leaving patients unable to anticipate expenses.
- **Revocation limited to postal mail:** Revoking authorization requires a signed letter mailed to the Privacy Officer — no fax, email, or in-person option.
- **No notarization or witness required** — a positive absence.
- **Submission methods:** The form lists fax (626-307-2186), mail, email, pick-up, and hand delivery. Fax and email availability mean a patient can submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Email delivery option** with a dedicated field — uncommon among ROI forms.
- **"Inspect or Review" checkbox** alongside copies — acknowledges the HIPAA right to review.
- **Granular record type selection** giving patients meaningful control.
- **Clear treatment non-conditionality statement** and 180-day expiration with patient override.

## Overall Assessment

Garfield Medical Center provides a reasonably well-structured authorization form that is easy to find and offers useful features like email delivery and record type granularity. However, it falls short of patient-centeredness by funneling all requests through a generic third-party release form, lacking fillable fields, and bundling a CD liability waiver. The absence of a dedicated patient access pathway and the non-fillable PDF format are the most significant gaps. The facility meets the baseline for electronic submission (fax and email are available) but offers no modern digital workflow.
