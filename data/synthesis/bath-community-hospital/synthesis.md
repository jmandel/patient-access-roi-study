# Bath Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Bath Community Hospital is an independent, nonprofit critical access hospital in Hot Springs, Virginia. The organization offers a single ROI form for medical records requests, hosted on its website. No patient portal, online request wizard, or alternative digital pathway was identified.

## Forms and Pathways

Only one form was found: a one-page "Request of Information" PDF (`form-1.pdf`) branded under **Bath Community Physicians Group** rather than Bath Community Hospital itself. This branding mismatch is common among small critical access hospitals where the hospital and physician group share administrative infrastructure. The form is hosted on the hospital's website at `https://bathhospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medical-Records-Request.pdf` and linked from the Patient Resources → Forms page.

The form is a generic release-of-information authorization — it uses a "Send / Receive" and "To / From" structure designed primarily for inter-provider record transfers, not for patient self-access. A patient wanting their own records would need to adapt the form by marking "Send" and writing in their own name and address as the recipient. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA individual access rights, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **moderately easy**. A targeted web search surfaced the PDF directly, and the hospital's website links to it from a clearly labeled "Medical Records Request" section under Patient Resources. The URL path is descriptive. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. For a small critical access hospital, the form is reasonably discoverable.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **scanned paper document** with an OCR text layer — not a digitally-created or fillable PDF. Despite metadata suggesting 21 fillable fields, the field names are empty and the form functions as a flat scan that must be printed and completed by hand. The OCR layer contains numerous errors ("ERNOTE," "LABffEST RESULTS," "IMAGINE REPORTS," "DISHCHARGE SUMMARY"), rendering the document inaccessible to screen readers and text-based search tools.

At one page with approximately 15 patient-completed fields, the form is appropriately brief. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → authorization direction → destination → reason → record type selection → signature block. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records consent paragraph is somewhat dense. No instructions are provided for how to complete or submit the form.

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient access requests. This creates a real barrier — a patient must find someone to witness their signature before submitting. The form also requests the last four digits of the patient's Social Security Number, raising privacy concerns for a document that may be faxed.

No fees are mentioned. No response time commitment is stated. Submission instructions are absent; the header includes a fax number (540-962-7881), suggesting fax is an available submission method, but this is not explicitly stated. No in-person-only requirement is stated, so fax submission appears available.

## Notable Strengths

The form correctly separates consent for alcohol/drug abuse and psychiatric records into a dedicated checkbox — proper 42 CFR Part 2 practice that many organizations neglect. It also includes a checkbox for patients to request a copy of their signed authorization, a HIPAA requirement that many forms omit.

## Overall Assessment

Bath Community Hospital provides a minimally functional pathway for patients to request their records, but the experience is not patient-centered. The form was designed for provider-to-provider transfers and requires patients to adapt it for self-access. The scanned-image quality, OCR errors, witness requirement, and lack of submission instructions all create friction. While the form is findable and brief, it reflects an older, paper-first approach to health information management typical of small independent facilities. A patient could complete the process, but would receive little guidance and face an unnecessary witness barrier along the way.
