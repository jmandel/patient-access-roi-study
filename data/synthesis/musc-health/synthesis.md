# MUSC Health University Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

MUSC Health provides five documents related to medical records release: the current English authorization form (form-1, Rev. 10/2023, 2 pages), an older superseded version (form-2, Version 11, dated 11/2017), a dental-specific variant (form-3, Version 9, dated 5/2019), a MyChart instructions guide (form-4, 4 pages, dated 2017), and a Spanish translation of the current form (form-5). The primary form for patient self-access is form-1, the current "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information."

Critically, MUSC offers three distinct request pathways clearly presented on its medical records page: (1) MyChart Patient Portal for existing portal users, (2) an online eRequest wizard via Ciox/Swellbox for fully digital submission, and (3) manual form download for traditional mail/fax/email submission. This multi-pathway approach gives patients genuine flexibility.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

MUSC does differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release — but at the process level, not the form level. The MyChart instructions document (form-4) explicitly states that MyChart is for patient self-requests, while the HIPAA authorization form should be used "for medical records to be sent directly to a physician office, hospital or third parties." The medical records webpage reinforces this distinction through its tabbed layout.

However, the downloadable PDF form itself (form-1) is a generic HIPAA authorization serving all purposes. "Patient/Guardian/Legal Rep" is listed as one purpose checkbox alongside "Continuing Care," "Legal," "Insurance," and others. The form does not distinguish the legal basis, fee structure, or processing rules for patient access under 45 CFR §164.524 versus third-party authorization — even though it cites that regulation. A patient using only the form must navigate a document designed around the third-party release paradigm.

## Retrieval Experience

Findability is excellent. The medical records page is reachable in two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records), and all three pathways are clearly presented. Web searches for MUSC records release forms return direct PDF links. No bot-blocking or access difficulties were encountered. The form URLs are descriptive and intuitive. Both English and Spanish versions are co-located under a clearly labeled section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a digitally-authored, text-layered PDF with clean layout and logical flow: Patient Information → Release From → Release To → Record Types → SUD Records → Purpose → Date Range → Release Method → Authorization/Consent → Signature. At two pages, the length is appropriate — page one handles all authorization substance, page two provides a useful facility contact directory for nine MUSC Health locations across South Carolina.

The most significant technical shortcoming is that the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being revised in October 2023. Patients must print the PDF and handwrite all entries, then fax, scan-and-email, or mail the completed form. This is a missed opportunity for a major academic medical center's current-revision document.

Record type options are granular and well-designed, including a dedicated Substance Use Disorder section with proper 42 CFR Part 2 citation and opt-in choices. Delivery options include mail, MyChart, fax, and encrypted email. However, the encrypted email option creates confusion: the checkbox says "Encrypted E-mail" but the accompanying consent language warns about "unencrypted e-mail" risks, leaving patients uncertain about what they're authorizing.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The form includes a **witness signature line** — not required by HIPAA — paired with a header warning that "FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE MAY INVALIDATE THIS AUTHORIZATION." Together, these could prevent a patient completing the form at home without a witness from submitting it.

Fee language references only South Carolina law ("fees may be charged as provided by S.C. Law") without acknowledging HIPAA's more restrictive cost-based fee limits for patient self-access requests. The MyChart instructions document goes further, stating a blanket fee "for all patient requests" with a prepayment requirement and no disclosed amounts — a notable compliance concern.

The form requires attaching a copy of photo identification, which is reasonable but adds friction for remote submission.

## Strengths

MUSC's standout features include: a **Spanish-language form** that faithfully mirrors the current English version with professional translation quality; **three clearly presented request pathways** including a fully digital portal option (Ciox/Swellbox); a **comprehensive nine-location facility directory** with fax numbers, phone numbers, and dedicated ROI email addresses; **granular SUD records consent** with correct 42 CFR Part 2 citation; and an **explicit citation of 45 CFR §164.524** (patient right of access).

## Overall Assessment

MUSC Health demonstrates strong organizational infrastructure for records access — excellent findability, multiple pathways, bilingual support, and process-level differentiation between patient and third-party requests. However, the core downloadable form remains a generic authorization that doesn't center patient self-access, the PDF is not fillable despite a 2023 revision, and compliance details around fees and the witness requirement introduce unnecessary friction. The availability of the Ciox/Swellbox portal partially mitigates the form-level weaknesses by offering patients a fully digital alternative. Overall, this is a competent but not exceptional approach from a well-resourced teaching hospital.
