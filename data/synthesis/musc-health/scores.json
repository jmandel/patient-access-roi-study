      "score": 4,

      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but the primary downloadable form wasn't designed for them — it's a generic HIPAA authorization with 'Patient Request' as one checkbox among seven purposes; the org differentiates at the process level (MyChart for self-access, auth form for third-party) but not within the form itself."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements beyond what HIPAA requires — witness signature line not required by HIPAA, fee language references only SC state law without acknowledging HIPAA's cost-based fee limits for patient access, prepayment requirement in MyChart instructions; offset by proper revocation language, voluntariness statement, and 45 CFR §164.524 citation."
