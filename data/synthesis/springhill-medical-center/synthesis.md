# Springhill Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms & Pathways

Springhill Medical Center provides two downloadable documents from its Medical Records page: a single-page "Request for Release of Health Information" authorization form (form-1.pdf) and a generic ONC patient rights infographic (form-2.pdf). Only form-1 is an actionable authorization form. The organization's Medical Records page also links to a **Zoho-based online ROI request portal** operated by MedRecs Management, and mentions a patient portal. The HIM department accepts fax submissions at 251.410.4014.

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

Springhill does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole authorization form uses a generic structure — "I hereby authorize ___ to release the following information to ___" — designed for third-party disclosure. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in the hospital as the source and themselves as the recipient, with no guidance for this use case. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no dedicated patient access form, and no language acknowledging that individual access requests have different legal requirements than third-party authorizations. The Zoho portal may offer a more tailored digital workflow, but the downloadable form funnels all requesters through a single generic pathway.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A simple web search returned the PDF directly, and the organization's Medical Records page clearly links to both the form and the Zoho portal. No bot blocking or browser workarounds were needed. However, the form URL embeds "2011-Version-1" in the filename, raising immediate questions about currency.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat, non-fillable PDF** — no interactive fields, no clickable checkboxes, just underscore blanks and bracket-style checkboxes requiring print-and-handwrite completion. At one page, the length is reasonable, and the logical flow (demographics → authorization → record types → delivery method → legal language → signature) is sound. However, the form is visually dated and dense, cramming all content onto a single page with small text. The language is a mix of functional and legal — mostly accessible but with a dense legal block at the bottom covering revocability, sensitive information categories, and redisclosure warnings.

The form requests approximately 20–25 fields including patient demographics, record type selections, delivery method details, and signatures. Notably, it asks for the patient's **Social Security Number**, which is unnecessary for a records request and creates a significant privacy risk.

## Barriers & Concerns

Several barriers stand out:

- **SSN collection**: Requesting Social Security Numbers for a medical records request creates unnecessary privacy risk, especially for forms submitted via fax or email.
- **Witness signature line**: The form includes a "Signature of Witness" field, implying a witness may be required — an unnecessary barrier with no HIPAA basis for patient-initiated requests.
- **Sensitive information bundling**: Substance abuse, psychiatric, STD, and HIV/AIDS records are bundled into the general authorization without separate opt-in, potentially conflicting with 42 CFR Part 2.
- **Outdated references**: The form still uses the legacy name "Springhill Memorial Hospital" and references "UB-92" (replaced by UB-04 in 2007), signaling a form that has not been updated in over a decade.

## Notable Strengths

- **Multiple delivery methods**: The 2011-era form offers five delivery options — pick-up, mail, fax, patient portal, and email — which was forward-looking for its time.
- **Online portal availability**: The Zoho-based electronic request portal provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.
- **Patient rights education**: Hosting the ONC patient rights infographic shows awareness of patient access rights, even if the resource is generic.
- **Non-conditioning statement**: The form explicitly states that treatment and payment cannot be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Springhill Medical Center provides a functional but dated pathway for records access. The form is easy to find and offers multiple submission methods including fax and email, but the authorization form itself is a 15-year-old, non-fillable generic release form that does not distinguish patient self-access from third-party disclosure. The SSN requirement and witness signature line create unnecessary barriers. The existence of a Zoho-based online portal is a meaningful positive, offering patients a digital alternative — though the downloadable form itself reflects a process that has not been meaningfully updated since 2011. A patient can get their records through this organization, but the experience requires navigating a form not designed for them.
