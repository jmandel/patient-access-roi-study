# Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC) is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Anchorage, Alaska. Two documents were retrieved from its publicly accessible forms page: a primary ROI authorization form ("Advanced Authorization for Release of Information," Rev. 08/2025) and a standing PHI Disclosure Agreement (Rev. 8/4/23). Of these, form-1 is the relevant document for a patient requesting copies of their own health records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

ANHC does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form. The primary ROI form (form-1) is a dual-purpose generic HIPAA authorization covering both "obtain information from" an external source and "release information to" a third party. A patient wanting their own records must check "Release Information to" and fill in their own name and address as the recipient — functional, but not intuitive. The form's instructions frame it around sending records elsewhere, not around the patient's individual Right of Access. There is no separate, simplified pathway for patients who just want their own records.

That said, the form does include a notably strong patient-rights statement: it explicitly cites 45 CFR § 164.524 and tells patients they are "NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information." This is uncommon and commendable, partially compensating for the generic form structure.

The retrieval notes also mention a text-based ROI request option (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which could be a more accessible alternative channel, though its scope and workflow aren't detailed on the forms page.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A site-scoped search surfaced the ANHC forms page (https://www.anhc.org/forms), which is well-organized with clear section headings including a "Request a Release of Information" section with direct PDF links. No bot blocking, captchas, or authentication barriers were encountered. The form was also available in Spanish, which is a notable accessibility feature for an FQHC. Difficulty: **easy**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1) is a single-page, digitally composed document — not a scan — with a clean text layer and reasonable file size (164 KB). However, despite being revised as recently as August 2025, it has **zero fillable PDF fields**. Patients must print the form, fill it by hand, and return it via fax or in person. This is a significant missed opportunity for a document that is clearly digitally designed.

The form collects approximately 15 fields: patient name, DOB, last four SSN digits, two phone numbers, full address, recipient information, record type checkboxes, sensitive information authorization, date range, and signature. Requesting SSN digits is unnecessary for a records request and adds friction. The form fits everything on one page, which is efficient but dense. Layout is adequate with clear section divisions, though the volume of content compressed onto a single page limits whitespace.

Language is generally accessible. The introductory "PLEASE READ" paragraph is clear and plain-language. The legal disclosure section is denser but not impenetrable, covering authorization voluntariness, expiration, revocation rights, and redisclosure prohibitions. There is a typo ("heath care" instead of "health care") and a malformed HIPAA citation in the legal text.

## Barriers and Compliance

- **Fees**: The form discloses that ANHC charges for copies, with an exception for facility-to-facility transfers. It does not clarify that patient self-access requests are subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee limits, which could discourage patients.
- **SSN collection**: Requesting the last four SSN digits is unnecessary and creates friction.
- **No notarization** required — positive.
- **Submission**: Fax (907-743-7255) is available as an electronic submission method. The form also lists the physical address. No email or portal submission option exists for the ROI form itself, though ANHC does use MyChart (referenced in form-2).
- **Response time**: Not stated on the form.

## Bright Spots

- **Explicit HIPAA Right of Access citation** (45 CFR § 164.524) with clear patient-empowering language
- **Spanish-language version** of the ROI form available
- **Text-message alternative** for initiating ROI requests
- **Recently revised** (08/2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Adolescent privacy protections** on form-2 (MyChart proxy access controls for minors 12–17)

## Overall Assessment

ANHC presents a mixed picture. The forms are easy to find, the website is well-organized, and several bright spots — Spanish availability, text-message option, explicit HIPAA rights language — show genuine attention to patient access. However, the core pathway funnels patients through a generic third-party authorization form rather than offering a dedicated patient self-access route, the primary PDF has no fillable fields despite recent revision, and the fee language could discourage patients from exercising their rights. For an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations, the lack of a fillable digital form is a notable gap. The organization earns credit for accessibility features and rights transparency, but falls short on digital form quality and access pathway differentiation.
