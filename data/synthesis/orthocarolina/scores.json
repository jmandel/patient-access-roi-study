      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Single-page form with logical flow and reasonable record-type granularity, but dense cramped layout, garbled text in delivery section due to overlapping text boxes, and run-on legal paragraphs create notable clarity problems."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Generic HIPAA authorization form with a 'Personal Use' checkbox acknowledges patient self-access but was not designed for it — patients must list themselves as the disclosure recipient and navigate fields intended for third-party releases."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Revocation rights and non-conditioning language are properly stated, but vague purpose-dependent fee structure with no cost-based fee distinction for patient access, broad liability waiver, and dropped refusal notice go beyond what the law requires."
