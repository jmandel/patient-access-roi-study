    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital — ChartRequest provides an online portal workflow for form completion and submission, but mandatory account creation on a third-party platform is a gap that prevents patients from previewing the process."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 2,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
