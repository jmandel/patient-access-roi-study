# Minnie Hamilton Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Minnie Hamilton Health System (MHHS) is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Grantsville, West Virginia, affiliated with Mon Health. The organization does not publish any downloadable ROI or patient access form on its website. Instead, it directs all medical records requests through ChartRequest, a third-party online portal. Two documents were downloaded during this evaluation: a patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) and a Mon Health Medical Center authorization form (form-2.pdf) from the affiliate system — neither is an MHHS-branded records request form.

## Access Pathway

MHHS routes patients to ChartRequest (https://app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville) for medical records requests. This is an online portal where the authorization form is embedded in the electronic workflow. While portal-based submission is inherently electronic and potentially convenient, ChartRequest requires account creation before a patient can even see the authorization form or understand the terms of the request. This creates opacity — patients cannot preview the form, understand fee structures, or assess what information they'll need to provide before committing to a third-party account.

The organization does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The ChartRequest portal appears to be a general records release platform, not a pathway specifically designed for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524. There is no publicly visible indication that MHHS has a separate, streamlined process for patients requesting their own records.

MHHS also maintains an Athena Health patient portal for clinical messaging, but the only downloaded document about it (form-1.pdf) covers sending documents *to* providers — the opposite direction of a records request. Whether a patient could request records through a portal message is unclear; the website directs records requests exclusively through ChartRequest.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding records request information for MHHS was **hard**. An extensive search process — multiple query variations, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine CDX API queries, and direct website navigation — failed to surface any downloadable ROI form. The MHHS website has no "Patient Forms" or "Downloads" section. The website does link to ChartRequest from the patients page, but there is no standalone form to evaluate. The Mon Health authorization form (form-2.pdf) was located only by broadening the search to the affiliate system and is branded exclusively for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — a separate facility approximately 150 miles away.

## Form Document Quality

Because MHHS does not publish a standalone form, there is no primary form to assess for document quality in the traditional sense. The ChartRequest portal workflow could not be evaluated without creating an account. The Mon Health form (form-2.pdf), while not applicable to MHHS, provides the closest reference point: it is a single-page, non-fillable PDF (zero interactive fields) with dense content, a 4.1 MB file size (extremely bloated with 40 embedded images and 107 fonts), and no instructions for patients. It is a generic third-party authorization form that includes "Personal Use" as one purpose option but is not designed around patient self-access.

The patient portal instruction guide (form-1.pdf) is well-written with numbered steps and plain language, suggesting MHHS is capable of producing clear patient-facing materials — but this capability was not applied to the records request process.

## Barriers and Compliance Concerns

The primary barrier is **gatekeeping behind account creation**. Patients must create a ChartRequest account before they can access the authorization form or learn anything about the records request process. For patients with limited internet access or digital literacy — a real concern in rural Grantsville, WV — this is a significant obstacle. There is no phone-based or paper-based alternative publicly documented on the website, though the medical records department phone number (304-354-9700, ext. 2521) is listed.

No fee information is publicly available. No response time commitment is published. No patient rights information is accessible before engaging with the ChartRequest platform. The lack of any publicly visible authorization terms means patients cannot make informed decisions about the process before entering it.

## Strengths

- **Electronic submission pathway**: The ChartRequest portal provides a fully digital workflow, eliminating the need for printing, faxing, or mailing paper forms.
- **Digital-first approach**: MHHS has adopted modern platforms (Athena Health portal, ChartRequest) rather than relying solely on paper-based processes.
- **Clear instructional writing**: The patient portal guide demonstrates an ability to produce accessible, well-structured patient materials.

## Overall Assessment

Minnie Hamilton Health System presents a paradox: it has adopted a modern electronic records request platform, but in doing so has made the process less transparent and less accessible than many organizations that simply post a PDF form. The complete absence of a publicly available authorization form, fee schedule, timeline, or patient rights information means that MHHS patients enter the records request process with no visibility into what to expect. The reliance on a third-party platform with mandatory account creation creates an unnecessary gatekeeping barrier, particularly problematic for a rural critical access hospital serving a population that may have limited internet access. While the ChartRequest workflow may be well-designed internally, the opaque exterior facing patients undermines what could otherwise be a modern, patient-friendly approach.
