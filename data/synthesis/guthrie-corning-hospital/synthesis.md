# Guthrie Corning Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Guthrie Corning Hospital is a community hospital in Corning, NY, operating within the Guthrie Clinic regional health system. All medical records forms are published at the system level by Guthrie Clinic and apply uniformly across its facilities (Corning, Troy, Cortland, Robert Packer, and Towanda Campus). Three documents were found: a general-purpose ROI authorization form (form-1), a family/friends access authorization (form-2), and a companion instruction sheet with fees and contact information (form-3).

## Best Pathway for Patient Self-Access

The most relevant document for a patient requesting their own records is **form-1**, the "Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form — it serves all release purposes (provider-to-provider, legal, insurance, personal use) rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. A patient must select "Personal Use" from a list of purpose options alongside "Legal," "Insurance," and "Lay Caregiver." The form does not differentiate individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524 from third-party authorization under § 164.508. Form-2 (family access) is irrelevant for patient self-access. Form-3 (instructions) supplements form-1 with submission details and fees.

The instruction sheet mentions that "Continuation of care requests may also be completed thru your individual eGuthrie/MyChart account," hinting at a patient portal pathway, but no detail is provided and this does not appear to cover general patient access requests.

## Retrieval Experience

Forms were **easy to find**. A basic web search immediately returned the PDF, and the Guthrie website's medical records page (guthrie.org/medical-records) serves as a well-organized hub. No bot blocking, JavaScript barriers, or login was required. All three documents were directly downloadable.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, non-fillable PDF**. It has zero interactive fields — patients must print it and fill it out by hand. Despite being digitally authored (not a scan), it was designed as a print-and-fill document with blank lines and empty checkbox squares rather than interactive elements. The form uses 9 fonts and has a dense layout that packs patient demographics, facility selection, record type checkboxes, format options, recipient information, purpose, rights statements, sensitive information opt-outs, and signature into one page. This compression keeps the form brief but makes it visually crowded.

The form's organization is logical: numbered sections flow from facility selection through record types, format, recipient, purpose, rights, expiration, and sensitive information. Language is moderately legalistic — phrases like "I authorize the disclosure of the above-named individual's health information" use distancing third-person framing. The instruction to "Read Entire Document Before Signing" is helpful but insufficient as the only guidance on the form itself.

Notable content features include three format options (Paper Copy, Electronic CD/DVD, Electronic On-Line) and granular record type selection (discharge summary, H&P, operative report, radiology by modality, etc.), giving patients meaningful control.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees** are transparent: the companion instruction sheet states a $6.50 flat rate for personal-use electronic records (HIPAA-compliant) and explicitly notes no charge for provider-to-provider transfers. This fee transparency, while not on the form itself, is better than most organizations.

**Submission** is available by mail, fax, or in-person — fax provides an adequate electronic submission channel. No online or email submission is available.

**No notarization** is required. The form does request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary and may deter privacy-conscious patients. The sensitive information default is opt-out (drug/alcohol, HIV, mental health records are released unless the patient checks boxes to exclude them), which is less protective than an opt-in approach. Genetic information is mentioned with no opt-out at all.

Corning Hospital patients face a geographic nuance: the instruction sheet notes "No onsite support" for Corning, directing patients to contact Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA, and mail forms to that address. This could be disorienting for local patients.

## Notable Strengths

- Excellent findability with a well-organized central medical records page
- Single-page form keeps burden low
- Clear fee transparency with HIPAA-compliant pricing
- Granular record type and format selection including electronic options
- System-wide forms eliminate confusion across facilities

## Notable Weaknesses

- No fillable/interactive fields despite being a digitally-created PDF
- Generic authorization form with no dedicated patient access pathway
- No reference to patient's right of access under HIPAA
- Sensitive information defaults to release (opt-out rather than opt-in)
- Critical information (fees, submission addresses, fax numbers) split across a separate document
- No onsite medical records support at Corning Hospital itself

## Overall Assessment

Guthrie Corning Hospital provides a functional but unexceptional records request process. The forms are easy to find, the fee structure is transparent and compliant, and the single-page format keeps patient burden manageable. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization approach that doesn't distinguish patient self-access from third-party release, and the reliance on a print-handwrite-fax workflow place it squarely in the middle tier of organizations studied. The process works, but it was not designed with the patient as the primary user.
