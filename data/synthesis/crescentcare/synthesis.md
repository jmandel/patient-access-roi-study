# CrescentCare — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

CrescentCare is an independent nonprofit FQHC in New Orleans, Louisiana. The organization provides two downloadable PDF authorization forms — one in English (form-1.pdf) and one in Spanish (form-2.pdf) — for patients to request release of their medical information. Both are prominently linked from the Patient Resources and Downloads page. Notably, CrescentCare also maintains a dedicated "Request your medical records" page at `/records-request-form/` with an online submission option, providing a digital-first alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Access Pathway Assessment

CrescentCare uses a single generic HIPAA authorization form for both patient self-access and third-party release. However, the form is designed with patient self-access as a first-class use case: the "Myself via" option appears first in the recipient section, before the "Or to:" third-party option. This is a meaningful design choice that signals patient access is not an afterthought. The form offers three delivery methods for self-requests — Patient Portal, Encrypted Email, and Pick Up — with two of the three being electronic.

The organization goes further by offering a separate online records request page, giving patients who prefer a fully digital workflow an alternative to printing and mailing a PDF. This dual-pathway approach (PDF form plus online portal) is commendable for an FQHC.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding CrescentCare's forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's Patient Resources page prominently lists both language versions. No bot blocking, browser fallbacks, or creative search strategies were needed. The filenames are descriptive and language-tagged (`_en.pdf`, `_es.pdf`). Retrieval difficulty: Easy.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-1.pdf) is a single-page, digitally-authored PDF with a clean text layer. It follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient Information → Recipient → Information to Be Disclosed → Special Authorization for Sensitive Records → Purpose → Expiration → Patient Rights → Signature. The language is plain and accessible throughout; the patient rights section uses clear bullet points rather than dense legalese.

The form provides meaningful granularity with six record-type checkboxes plus an "Other" option, and appropriately gates sensitive records (behavioral health, substance use, HIV/AIDS) behind separate patient initials, consistent with Louisiana law and 42 CFR Part 2.

The primary weakness is that the PDF has zero fillable form fields despite being digitally authored. Patients must print, handwrite, and return the form — a notable gap for a document distributed online. Additionally, the form lacks submission instructions: no mailing address, fax number, or email address appears on the form itself, leaving patients uncertain how to return it.

## Barriers and Compliance

CrescentCare's form imposes no unnecessary barriers. There is no notarization or witness requirement. The no-conditioning statement is explicit ("my treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on my signing this authorization"). Revocation rights are clearly stated, though requiring a "signed letter" is a slightly higher bar than simply accepting any written request. No fees are mentioned on the form — this neither discourages patients nor sets expectations. No response timeframe is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Providing fully translated English and Spanish forms with identical structure is especially appropriate for New Orleans' diverse patient population.
- **Electronic delivery options**: Offering Patient Portal and Encrypted Email for self-requests is progressive — many organizations only offer mail or pickup.
- **Online records request page**: The dedicated `/records-request-form/` page provides a digital alternative to the print-and-mail PDF workflow.
- **Single-page efficiency**: Fitting all necessary authorization elements on one well-organized page respects patient time.
- **Self-access prioritized**: Placing the "Myself via" option before third-party release on the form signals that patient access is a primary use case.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDF**: Zero interactive form fields despite digital authoring — a missed opportunity for a form designed for online distribution.
- **No submission instructions**: The form gives patients no guidance on how to return the completed authorization.
- **No fee or timeline disclosure**: Patients have no expectations about cost or turnaround time.

## Overall Assessment

CrescentCare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an FQHC. The combination of a well-designed bilingual authorization form, explicit patient self-access options, electronic delivery methods, and a separate online records request portal places it ahead of most peers. The main gaps — a non-fillable PDF and missing submission instructions — are common across the industry and prevent an excellent rating. Overall grade: B.
