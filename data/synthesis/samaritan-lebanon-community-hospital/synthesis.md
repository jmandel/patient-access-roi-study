# Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Samaritan Lebanon Community Hospital is part of Samaritan Health Services (SHS), a nonprofit regional health system in Oregon's Willamette Valley. All records request forms and processes operate at the system level — there are no facility-specific forms for the Lebanon campus. Five documents were retrieved: a standard Authorization to Disclose Health Information in English (form-4) and Spanish (form-5), a specialized Computer Readable EHI Export Request in English (form-1) and Spanish (form-2), and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3).

## Pathways Available

SHS offers three distinct pathways for patients requesting their own records:

1. **MRO Express Online Portal** — The primary pathway the website directs patients toward. This is an outsourced third-party portal (MRO Corp.) for submitting records requests online. No downloadable PDF is produced; the request is web-based.

2. **Standard Authorization Form (form-4/form-5)** — A general-purpose "Authorization to Disclose Health Information" PDF covering both patient self-access and third-party release. Submittable by mail, fax, or email. Available in English and Spanish.

3. **EHI Computer Readable Export Form (form-1/form-2)** — A specialized form for requesting health information in machine-readable format. Also available in English and Spanish. This is a notably rare offering.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The standard form (form-4) is a generic HIPAA authorization that serves both patient self-access and third-party release. However, it handles the distinction reasonably well: Section 3 includes a "Personal" checkbox for purpose, and Section 7 splits into "released to myself" (with multiple delivery options) versus "OR release my records to" a third party. This is a combined form, not a dedicated patient access pathway, but the dual structure is functional and the patient self-access route is clearly accommodated.

The EHI export form (form-1) is genuinely patient-centric — its purpose field comes pre-checked as "Patient Request - Electronic" and the entire form is designed around patient self-access. However, this serves only the niche use case of computer-readable data export.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the downloadable forms was **difficult**. The medical records request page primarily directs patients to the MRO Express online portal. The PDF form download links are hidden inside a collapsed accordion section titled "Sending a Request by Mail or Fax" that required browser DevTools (JavaScript link extraction) to discover. Web searches returned confusable results from unrelated organizations with similar names. A patient who prefers a traditional form rather than the online portal would struggle to find the PDF.

## Form Document Quality

The primary form (form-4) is a 2-page, digitally-authored PDF with clean text and logical organization. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete it by hand despite the form being digital in origin. The form uses numbered sections (1–9) with clear headers and a matching instruction page. The language mixes functional plain language with legal boilerplate; the rights section is dense but the instructions on page 2 are more accessible. Record type granularity is strong, with 11 specific checkboxes plus an "Other" field.

Format and delivery options are a genuine bright spot: patients can choose from MyChart, email, paper, CD, fax, or write in an alternative. The form explicitly offers electronic delivery, which is uncommon among ROI forms.

## Barriers and Compliance

**Fees**: The fee disclosure is exemplary. Form-4 explicitly states "Initial Patient Request: No Charge" and "Continuing Care: No Charge," with fees only for third-party requests. However, the EHI export form (form-1) lacks this "no charge" language, stating only that "reasonable cost-based fees apply" — an inconsistency that could deter patients seeking computer-readable data.

**Processing time**: Stated as "up to 30 days," within HIPAA's permitted window.

**No notarization** required. No in-person-only submission requirement — mail, fax, and email are all accepted.

**Submission**: The form can be submitted by mail, fax (541-768-9363), or email (SHSHIMROI@samhealth.org). The email option is notable — it allows fully electronic submission even without the MRO portal, though the non-fillable PDF creates an awkward print-fill-scan-email workflow.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: All forms (standard ROI and EHI export) are available in both English and Spanish — a meaningful commitment to language access.
- **Dedicated EHI export form**: Offering a separate form specifically for computer-readable health information export is exceptionally rare and demonstrates genuine Cures Act awareness.
- **Fee transparency**: The three-tier fee structure with "No Charge" for patient requests is clear and patient-friendly.
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Six format options including two electronic channels (MyChart and email).
- **Email submission channel**: Accepting form submission via email lowers barriers significantly.

## Weaknesses

- **Non-fillable PDFs**: All forms have zero interactive fields despite being digitally authored — a clear missed opportunity.
- **Hidden download links**: The downloadable forms are buried in collapsed accordion sections, requiring technical effort to discover.
- **No dedicated patient access form**: The standard form serves both patient self-access and third-party release, requiring patients to navigate which sections apply.
- **EHI export fee ambiguity**: The EHI form does not match the standard form's "no charge" commitment for patient requests.

## Overall Assessment

Samaritan Health Services provides a solid, above-average experience for patients requesting their own records. The combination of an online portal as the primary pathway, a well-structured authorization form with multiple delivery options, bilingual availability, transparent fee disclosures, and a rare dedicated EHI export form puts this organization ahead of most peers. The main gaps are the non-fillable PDF forms and the poor discoverability of the downloadable form option. The organization clearly takes patient access seriously, even if the form design hasn't been fully modernized for digital-first completion.
