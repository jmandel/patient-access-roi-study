# NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) provides a well-organized, multi-channel records request system anchored by a system-wide "Tripartite" HIPAA authorization form shared across NYP, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medicine. Three documents were retrieved: the primary Tripartite ROI form (form-1), a patient-facing FAQ (form-2), and an older Lawrence campus-specific variant (form-3). The organization directs patients primarily to a Verisma online portal, with MyChart and paper form submission as alternatives.

## Access Pathway & Differentiation

NYP offers genuine differentiation at the pathway level: the medical records page provides separate Verisma portal links for Patient, Patient Representative, and Attorney workflows. This is a meaningful distinction that helps patients identify their correct route. However, the underlying authorization framework remains generic — the paper form (form-1) is a single HIPAA authorization used for all disclosure types, with "Patient Request" as one of seven checkboxes alongside Life Insurance, Legal Purposes, and Worker's Comp. The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) or distinguish the legal framework for patient self-access from third-party release. The authorization section states "if you refuse to sign NYP will not release your records," which is accurate for third-party releases but misleading for patient access requests, where HIPAA requires only a written request, not a signed authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward — two clicks from the homepage (Patients & Visitors → Medical Records) leads to a well-organized page. Web searches readily surface both the medical records page and direct PDF links. The form is hosted on a digital asset management platform (nyp.widen.net), which initially served an HTML viewer rather than the raw PDF, requiring some effort to extract the actual download URL. This is a minor friction point for an otherwise easy retrieval.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is technically excellent. It is a born-digital, fully interactive PDF with 103 fillable fields — one of the most technically capable ROI forms in this study. The 2-page form follows a logical flow through patient demographics, recipient information, disclosing entity selection (covering all 11 NYP campuses plus outpatient groups), granular record-type checkboxes (16+ options including "Entire Medical Record"), sensitive information authorization (compliant with New York state law for HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing), six delivery methods, and a numbered authorization section. The layout is clean with bold section headers, though the density of content on two pages results in small text in places. The authorization language includes some compound legalese that is difficult to parse, but the overall organization is strong.

The form is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese — a notable accommodation for New York City's diverse population.

## Barriers

No notarization is required on the primary form (though the older Lawrence form-3 includes a "Witness or Notary" line). The Verisma portal requires two forms of photo ID, which exceeds typical HIPAA identity verification expectations and may exclude patients without two scannable photo IDs. The form mandates a date-of-service range, stating "records will not be released unless Date of Service section is complete" — a potential barrier for patients seeking their complete longitudinal record. Fees are described as "reasonable fees to recover costs," tracking HIPAA's statutory language without specifying amounts. No response time commitment appears on the form or FAQ.

## Notable Strengths

NYP's system stands out for its dedicated phone line (646-NYP-4ROI, M-F 8am-6pm), multilingual form availability, comprehensive FAQ document with transparent MyChart record-type listings, and the sheer technical quality of the fillable PDF. The six delivery options — paper, fax, email, CD, flash drive, and patient portal (at no cost) — give patients meaningful choice.

## Overall Assessment

NYP delivers a technically strong, well-organized records request experience with good findability and multiple access channels. The main weakness is the lack of a truly patient-access-specific pathway: despite portal-level differentiation, the underlying form treats patient self-access as one use case among many without acknowledging the distinct legal rights involved. The two-photo-ID portal requirement and mandatory date-of-service range create unnecessary friction. Overall, this is a solid B-level experience — above average in technical execution but falling short of patient-centered design.
