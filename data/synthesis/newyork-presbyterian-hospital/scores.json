      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital — form-1 has 103 fillable fields for complete on-screen completion, and Verisma portal offers full online submission; one gap is that PDF submission still requires fax/mail, and portal demands two photo IDs."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — 'Patient Request' is one checkbox among seven on a generic HIPAA authorization form; no Right of Access language; portal offers separate patient link but underlying framework is third-party release."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities — fee language tracks HIPAA statutory standard, revocation rights stated, no notarization required; but mandatory date-of-service range, two-photo-ID portal requirement, and 'won't release if you don't sign' language create some unnecessary friction."

      "summary": "NYP delivers a technically strong, well-organized records request experience with excellent findability and multiple channels, but relies on a generic HIPAA authorization rather than a patient-access-specific pathway."
