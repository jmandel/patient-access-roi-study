# Intermountain Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT) is a community hospital within the Intermountain Health system (formerly Intermountain Healthcare), a major nonprofit health system operating across Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming. The facility uses system-wide forms rather than facility-specific ones — all three retrieved documents are branded and published by Intermountain Health at the enterprise level.

## Forms and Pathways

Three PDF forms were found, all hosted on Intermountain Health's website:

1. **Form 1** (legacy, 2017): "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — a general-purpose third-party release form. Non-fillable, branded under the old "Intermountain Healthcare" name. Effectively superseded but still accessible online.
2. **Form 2** (06/2025): "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)" — a fillable third-party disclosure form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug explicitly reads `request-records-be-sent-to-someone-else`.
3. **Form 3** (06/2025): "Patient Request for Health Information" — a fillable patient self-access form with 48 interactive fields. The URL slug reads `request-records-for-yourself`.

The most relevant form for a patient requesting their own records is **form 3**, which is the primary basis for this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Intermountain Health stands out for explicitly separating patient self-access from third-party release into **two distinct forms**. Form 3 is titled "Patient Request for Health Information," uses question-based section headings ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?"), and defaults to "Self" as the first delivery recipient option. This is meaningfully different from the common pattern of funneling all patients through a generic HIPAA authorization form. The footer acknowledges the patient's right of access under HIPAA.

One blemish: Form 2 (the third-party form) confusingly includes a "Patient Access Information" section with bullets about supervised in-person review and photo ID requirements, blurring the line between the two forms. However, the existence of a separate, cleaner patient-access form mitigates this.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. Standard web searches returned direct PDF download links with no login, portal, or JavaScript rendering required. No bot blocking was encountered. The forms are hosted on two domains — the legacy `intermountainhealthcare.org` and the current `prod.intermountainhealth.org` — which creates minor confusion but did not impede retrieval. The URL paths are descriptive and logical.

## Form Document Quality (Form 3)

Form 3 is a single-page, fully fillable PDF with 48 interactive fields, Print/Clear buttons, and a clean numbered 7-section layout. The language is plain and direct — section headings are phrased as questions, and the instruction "Please fill out all sections to avoid delay" is practical. Record types are covered by 12 checkboxes spanning clinical, imaging, billing, and substance use categories. Delivery options include paper mail, in-person pickup, and electronic (email, USB, CD, portal, other) with a free-text specification field. At ~2,030 characters of text, the form is admirably concise with no dense legal boilerplate.

Submission methods include email, fax, and mail — organized by state (UT/ID routes to Murray, CO/NV/MT/WY routes to Broomfield). Email submission is a genuine accessibility feature enabling fully digital completion and submission.

## Barriers

No notarization or witness signature is required. Multiple remote submission options (email, fax, mail) are available — no in-person-only restriction. Fee language is vague: "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records" without specifying amounts, which could deter patients. The UT/ID email routes to R1 RCM (`MedRecReq@r1rcm.com`), a third-party vendor, without explanation on the form.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient self-access form** separate from third-party authorization — uncommon and patient-centered
- **48 fillable fields** on a single page with Print/Clear buttons — excellent digital-first design
- **Question-based section headings** make the form feel conversational rather than bureaucratic
- **Email submission accepted** — a fully digital pathway from completion to submission
- **Electronic delivery explicitly offered** including email, USB, CD, portal, and "other"
- **Multilingual interpretation notices** on the legacy form (Chinese Traditional and Spanish)

## Overall Assessment

Intermountain Health provides one of the stronger patient access experiences in this study. The deliberate separation of patient self-access from third-party release, combined with a well-designed fillable form and multiple electronic submission channels, demonstrates genuine patient-centeredness. The form's plain language, logical structure, and concise single-page format make it accessible without assistance. Minor weaknesses — vague fee disclosure, undisclosed vendor routing, and a confusing legacy form still online — prevent a top-tier score but do not materially impede patient access.
