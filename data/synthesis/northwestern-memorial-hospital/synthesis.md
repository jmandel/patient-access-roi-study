# Northwestern Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Northwestern Memorial Hospital, part of the Northwestern Medicine / Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) system, publishes three documents related to medical records requests. The primary form is **form-1.pdf**, a 2-page English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form 8094, rev. 2/2026) — a system-wide ROI authorization covering all 11 NMHC hospitals, physician groups, and behavioral health locations. **Form-3.pdf** is a full Spanish translation of the same form (8094SP, rev. 8/2024). **Form-2.pdf** is a separate inbound records request form for transferring records *into* NMHC from other providers — not relevant for patient self-access.

All forms are published at the system level on nm.org and are used across all NMHC entities. Northwestern Memorial Hospital does not maintain facility-specific forms.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Northwestern Medicine does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The primary form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for all releases — to attorneys, insurers, other providers, and patients alike. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" as the purpose, then list themselves as the recipient in the "Send Information To" section. This is functional but unintuitive: the form was not designed with individual access as a first-class use case. There is no dedicated patient access request form, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) anywhere on the form. This matters because Right of Access requests carry different fee limits and timing requirements than third-party authorizations.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was trivially easy. A basic web search returned direct download links to the PDFs hosted on nm.org's media CDN. No website navigation, login, CAPTCHA, or bot-blocking was encountered. The URLs are descriptive and the forms are well-organized in the patients-and-visitors section.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a well-constructed interactive PDF with **79 fillable fields** — text inputs, checkboxes, and date fields can all be completed digitally without printing. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient demographics → facility selection → purpose → record types → delivery method → medical images → recipient → legal disclosures → signatures. Record-type categories include helpful parenthetical explanations (e.g., "Hospital Stay (History and physical, progress notes, consultations, operative reports, discharge summary, test results)") that help patients understand what they're requesting. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate.

The legal disclosure section is moderately dense but covers required elements: 30-day response window, right to revoke, no care denial for refusal to sign, and sensitive-record opt-outs (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic testing, mental health). The language is somewhat complex but not impenetrably legalistic.

## Submission and Delivery

Submission options are strong: mail (Winfield, IL), fax (312.926.3093), and email (releaseofinformation@nm.org). Delivery options are notably forward-looking: **MyNM patient portal**, fax, email, and US mail (CD or paper). The portal delivery option is a standout feature that removes a common access barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization or in-person requirements exist. Fees are referenced vaguely — "Standard record copying fees per 735 ILCS 5/8-2006 may apply" — without specific amounts or clarification that HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a cost-based amount. This ambiguity could lead patients to expect the (higher) Illinois statutory copying fees even for personal-use requests.

## Notable Strengths

- **Spanish-language form** with the same 82 fillable fields — Spanish-speaking patients get equal digital functionality
- **MyNM portal delivery** alongside fax, email, and mail
- **Email submission** (still uncommon among healthcare organizations)
- **Memorable toll-free number**: 877.9RECORD with TTY: 711 support
- **Parenthetical record-type explanations** helping patients understand each category

## Notable Weaknesses

- No dedicated patient access pathway — generic authorization form for all release types
- No reference to HIPAA Right of Access or patient access rights
- Fee language references Illinois statute without distinguishing patient-access fee limits
- Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version (missing hospital renaming, updated 42 CFR Part 2 language, and TTY reference)

## Overall Assessment

Northwestern Medicine provides a technically strong, easy-to-find form ecosystem with excellent digital features (fillable fields, email submission, portal delivery, Spanish translation). The primary weakness is structural: the organization channels all records requests — including patient self-access — through a generic authorization form designed for third-party release, without acknowledging the distinct rights and fee limits that apply to individual access under HIPAA. The form works well for patients who know what they need, but it wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.
