      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process by selecting 'Personal Use' and listing themselves as recipient, but the form was designed for third-party release — the patient must navigate sections intended for attorneys/insurers and figure out which parts apply to self-access."

      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: The form states a 30-day response time, includes right to revoke and no-care-denial clauses, and references 42 CFR Part 2; minor ambiguity in fee language citing Illinois statute without distinguishing HIPAA's lower patient-access fee limit."
