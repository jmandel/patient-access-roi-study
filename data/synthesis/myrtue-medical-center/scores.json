    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds; fax submission available — the form is a text-based PDF but has zero fillable fields, requiring print-and-handwrite workflow; fax and email submission are available as electronic submission pathways."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity or length issues — single-page design with logical top-to-bottom flow, clear section structure, and mostly plain language; minor issues include dense bottom section and parenthetical instructions that are easy to miss."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic bidirectional From/To authorization form requires patients to figure out which parts apply to self-access, with no Right of Access language, no dedicated patient pathway, and authorization framing (expiration, revocation) applied to what should be a simpler access request."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing that would materially impede a patient — no notarization or witness required, includes no-conditioning statement and revocation rights, but fee amounts are undisclosed and the form conflates §164.508 authorization requirements with §164.524 patient access rights."

      "summary": "Myrtue Medical Center provides a findable, well-organized single-page ROI form with progressive features (bilingual availability, MyChart and encrypted email delivery, careful substance use handling), but the lack of fillable fields, generic authorization framing, and absent patient access differentiation keep it from the top tier."
