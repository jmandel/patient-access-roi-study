    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The PDF has a text layer and is digitally composed but has zero fillable fields, requiring print-and-handwrite workflow. Fax and email submission to VitalChart are available, providing electronic submission options. Not level 4 because the form itself cannot be completed digitally."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized single-page form with clear numbered sections, logical flow, conversational headers, and good record-type granularity. Minor issues include dense legal boilerplate in Section 6 and ambiguous submission instructions. A patient could largely complete this without assistance."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The form is a generic authorization serving all release purposes; a patient can select 'Personal Use' but must navigate a form not designed for self-access. No mention of HIPAA Right of Access, no dedicated patient access pathway, and the form frames the patient as authorizing release to a third party."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Standard HIPAA disclosures present (right to revoke, non-conditioning, re-disclosure). First copy free per Kentucky law. However, $1.00/page for additional copies may exceed HIPAA cost-based limits for patient access, $5.00 late fee is problematic, and SSN collection is unnecessary — requirements that may go beyond what the law requires."
