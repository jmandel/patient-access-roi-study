# Lexington Clinic — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Lexington Clinic is an independent, for-profit physician practice in Lexington, Kentucky. Two ROI authorization forms were found on their website: a current 2024 version (form-1) co-branded with VitalChart, a third-party ROI processing vendor, and a legacy 2014 version (form-2) that remains publicly accessible but appears to be superseded. The 2024 form is the actively linked version on the Patient Forms page and represents the best available pathway for patient self-access.

## Access Pathway

Lexington Clinic does **not** offer a dedicated patient access pathway. Both forms are generic "Authorization for Release" documents designed to serve all disclosure purposes — patient self-access, transfer of care, legal requests, and other third-party releases. However, form-1 includes a "Personal Use" checkbox under "Purpose of Disclosure," which effectively signals a Right of Access request even though the form never explicitly references HIPAA § 164.524 or uses the term "Right of Access."

The organization funnels all records requests through VitalChart, which processes the authorization and fulfills the request. This vendor-mediated model means the patient completes a single generic authorization form and sends it to VitalChart rather than directly to Lexington Clinic's HIM department. No online portal or digital request wizard is available.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. A straightforward web search returned direct PDF download links on the first attempt. The Patient Forms page at lexingtonclinic.com/patients/patient-forms clearly lists the Medical Records Release Form. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor concern is that the legacy 2014 form (form-2) remains publicly indexed and discoverable via search engines, with no version labeling or "superseded" notice — creating a risk that patients might find and use the outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a single-page, digitally composed PDF with a clear text layer but **zero fillable fields** — a significant missed opportunity given its digital origin. A patient must print it, fill it by hand, and then submit it via mail, fax, or email to VitalChart. The layout is well-organized with six numbered sections following a logical "who → where → what → why → cost → sign" flow. Section headers like "TELL US ABOUT THE PATIENT" and "WHERE AND HOW ARE WE SENDING THE RECORDS?" are unusually conversational and patient-friendly for a medical-legal form. However, the legal disclosures in Section 6 shift to dense HIPAA boilerplate, and fitting everything onto one page makes the form somewhat dense.

Record-type granularity is good: patients can select specific providers, date ranges, conditions, and record subtypes (labs, radiology, office notes, immunizations, operative reports). Delivery options include mail, email, and fax (fax restricted to healthcare providers only). Email delivery to patients is a meaningful positive — many organizations offer only mail or fax.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fee structure**: The form cites KRS 422.317, stating the first copy is free, with additional copies at $1.00 per page. While the first-copy-free provision is patient-friendly, the $1.00/page charge for subsequent copies may exceed HIPAA's "reasonable, cost-based fee" limit for Right of Access requests. A $5.00 late fee and "non-refundable once services are rendered" language add financial friction not contemplated by HIPAA's access provisions.

**SSN collection**: The form requests the last four digits of the patient's SSN, which is not a HIPAA requirement for ROI authorization and raises privacy concerns.

**Submission ambiguity**: While VitalChart's mailing address, phone, fax, and email are listed at the bottom, the form never explicitly instructs patients on how to submit the completed authorization. A patient may be unsure whether they can email the completed form.

**No notarization or witness required** — a positive. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- First copy free with clear Kentucky statutory citation
- Email delivery available to patients (not just providers)
- Conversational, patient-friendly section headers
- Good record-type granularity enabling targeted requests
- Single-page, concise format
- Easy online findability

## Overall Assessment

Lexington Clinic provides a reasonably accessible records request process that clears several important bars: the form is easy to find, well-organized, and can be submitted electronically via fax or email to VitalChart. However, the lack of fillable fields, the generic authorization form design (no dedicated patient access pathway), and the potentially non-compliant fee structure for patient access requests hold it back from a higher rating. The organization's approach is typical of mid-sized independent practices that outsource ROI processing to a vendor — functional but not patient-centered.
