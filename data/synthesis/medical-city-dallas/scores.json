    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Clear three-section organization with labeled headers and granular record-type selection, but the single-page format creates extreme density with likely small fonts, and legal terminology may challenge low-literacy readers."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the form by selecting 'At the request of the individual' as the purpose, but the form was not designed for patient self-access — it is a generic authorization serving all release scenarios with no HIPAA Right of Access reference."
