# Sea Mar Community Health Centers — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Sea Mar Community Health Centers is an independent nonprofit FQHC based in Seattle, WA. The organization publishes a single ROI form — a general-purpose "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" — that serves as the only downloadable pathway for patients requesting their own records. Sea Mar also offers a patient portal (MyChart) at seamar.org/ohr/index.php, though this was not evaluated as part of the form retrieval process.

## Access Pathway

Sea Mar does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The sole form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed to cover all disclosure scenarios — transfer of care, third-party release, and patient-initiated requests alike. The "Purpose of the release" section includes "At my request" as one option alongside "Transfer of Care" and "Verbal Disclosure," but there is no separate patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no mention of the specific protections that apply to individual access requests (fee limits, format choice, 30-day timeline). A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form that treats their legally-distinct right as just another checkbox on a general authorization.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. A basic web search returned a direct link to the PDF on the first attempt, and a site-scoped search confirmed no other ROI forms exist. There was no bot blocking, login wall, or CAPTCHA. The URL (`seamar.org/dl/ROI%20COPY%202022%20PDF.pdf`) uses the acronym "ROI" which patients are unlikely to recognize, but the form was immediately discoverable through search engines. This is a genuine bright spot — many organizations make their forms far harder to find.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a single-page PDF with a text layer (not a scanned image), but it has **zero fillable fields**. All entries use underscores and blank lines designed for handwriting. A patient must print the form, fill it out by hand, and return it — there are no interactive checkboxes, text inputs, or digital signature fields. The form cannot be completed digitally without third-party PDF annotation tools.

The layout is structured with labeled sections on the left side (Patient Information, From, To, Information to be released, etc.) following a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the single-page compression creates density issues with minimal whitespace. The language mixes plain directions with legal terminology — the reference to "Title 42 of the United States code" is imprecise (it should cite 42 CFR Part 2 specifically) and provides no actionable information to patients.

The instruction "Please initial one section" under record types is confusing — there are actually six initialing options, some of which patients might logically want to combine. The "All records" option excludes sensitive information without clearly cross-referencing the separate sensitive information section below, creating a two-step requirement that patients could easily miss.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is the **apparent requirement for in-person submission**. The form lists delivery methods for receiving records (In-Clinic, Verbal, CD, Paper, Fax) but provides no mailing address, fax number, or email address for submitting the completed form. The "Staff Use Only" section — with checkboxes for "Verified all sections are complete" and staff initials — strongly implies the form is designed to be completed in-clinic, in front of staff. No fees are mentioned, and no response timeline is stated. The 90-day default expiration is reasonable for a third-party authorization but conceptually irrelevant for a patient access request, since the right of access is ongoing.

## Bright Spots

- **Granular record type options**: The "Recent summary of care" itemizes specific components (Medication List, Problem List, Progress Notes, Imaging, Immunizations, screening results), giving patients a clear picture of what they'll receive.
- **Minor consent section**: A well-structured section for minors ages 13–17 to authorize release of sensitive information, with age thresholds aligned to Washington State's mature minor doctrine.
- **Easy discoverability**: The form was found on the first search attempt with no access barriers.
- **Patient rights statement**: Present, though generic — covers revocation right and no-conditioning, but does not reference individual access rights.

## Overall Assessment

Sea Mar provides a functional but paper-centric, undifferentiated pathway for patient record access. The form is easy to find online but impossible to complete digitally, and the apparent in-person submission requirement creates a meaningful barrier. The conflation of patient self-access with third-party authorization means patients receive no information about their specific rights under HIPAA's Right of Access. For an FQHC serving diverse communities, the absence of a Spanish-language version and the lack of any digital workflow are notable gaps.
