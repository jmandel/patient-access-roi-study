      "score": 3,

      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the PDF form is a generic third-party authorization with a 'Self' checkbox rather than a dedicated patient access form, though the Swellbox portal offers a somewhat more patient-oriented alternative."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing that would materially impede a patient — proper revocation rights and non-conditioning disclosures are present, though the liability release clause and SSN request on form-2 are unnecessary requirements."
