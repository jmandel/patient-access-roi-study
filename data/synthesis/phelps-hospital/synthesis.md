# Phelps Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Phelps Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, NY is a community hospital within the Northwell Health system. It uses Northwell's system-wide forms for medical records requests, hosted at the parent system's medical records page (northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records). Six documents were retrieved in total: two core forms (patient access and third-party authorization), a Spanish bilingual authorization form, two companion instruction guides, and a duplicate non-fillable version of the authorization form.

## Access Pathway: Dedicated Patient Self-Access

Northwell Health stands out by clearly differentiating patient self-access from third-party release. The medical records page has two distinct sections: "Request for Access to Health Information" (for patients requesting their own records) and "Authorization for Release of Health Information" (for directing records to third parties). The patient access form (form-2) is explicitly titled "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative" and opens by citing HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524) — framing the request as an exercise of patient rights rather than a permission grant. A "To me" checkbox in Section 2 makes the self-access pathway concrete. This separation is a genuine best practice that many health systems fail to implement.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. Web searches for "Phelps Hospital" combined with medical records terms immediately surfaced the Northwell Health medical records page. The page is well-organized with descriptive URLs and clear section headings. The main friction is that Phelps Hospital's own sub-site (phelps.northwell.edu) does not host forms directly — patients must navigate to the parent system's website, which is a minor extra step but the connection is clear from the Northwell branding.

## Form Document Quality

The primary patient access form (form-2) is a 2-page digitally-authored PDF with 28 fillable interactive fields. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence: patient demographics, facility releasing records, recipient (with "To me" option), delivery manner and format, requested health information scope, substance use/HIV section, and signature. The delivery options grid is particularly well-designed, pairing delivery manner (mail, pickup, email, fax) with format (paper, USB, CD, secure/unsecure email) in a structured table. Scope options include medical record abstract, date-range records, entire record, lab results, radiology, itemized bills, and a free-text "Other" field — giving patients granular control.

The language is reasonably plain, with parenthetical glosses like "(From Who)" and "(To Who)" alongside formal labels. The substance use disorder section (Section 5) is denser legal text, but it's conditionally required — only for patients requesting those specific record types. A companion instruction document (form-6) provides step-by-step annotated examples with sample data, significantly lowering the completion barrier.

## Barriers and Concerns

No notarization is required. The witness signature line is present but not explicitly mandatory. No fees are mentioned. No in-person submission is required. These are all positives.

The most significant gap is the absence of submission instructions on the form itself — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link. A patient who fills out the form has no guidance on where to send it. Fax submission is presumably available as an industry standard for Northwell facilities, but the patient must find this information independently.

A notable equity concern: the website has a bug where both the "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)" links point to the same URL, which contains only the Spanish authorization (third-party) form. There is no Spanish-language version of the patient access form despite the website appearing to offer one. This effectively denies Spanish-speaking patients access to the correct form for exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

## Notable Strengths

The strongest features of Northwell's approach for Phelps Hospital patients are: (1) the dedicated patient access form with explicit HIPAA § 164.524 citation, (2) companion instruction documents for both forms with annotated visual examples, (3) rich delivery format options including secure email, USB, CD, and fax, (4) fully fillable interactive PDFs for digital completion, and (5) plain-language accessibility touches throughout. The dual-form architecture — with separate patient access and third-party release pathways — represents a structural investment in patient-centered design.

## Overall Assessment

Phelps Hospital, through its parent Northwell Health system, provides an above-average patient records request experience. The dedicated patient access pathway — with its explicit HIPAA § 164.524 framing, separate form architecture, and companion instruction materials — represents a genuinely patient-centered design that earns top marks for patient-centeredness. The fillable digital forms and comprehensive delivery options round out a strong offering. The main weaknesses — missing submission instructions on the form and the broken Spanish form links — are addressable defects rather than structural problems. This is a solid B-grade experience overall (4.25/5.0): clearly competent and patient-aware, with room for improvement in closing operational gaps.
