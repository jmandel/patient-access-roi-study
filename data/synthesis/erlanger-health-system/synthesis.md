# Erlanger Health System — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga, TN provides three distinct ROI-related documents: a general system-wide "Authorization for Release of Medical Information" (form-1), a behavioral health–specific disclosure authorization (form-2), and a dedicated "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" (form-3). The existence of form-3 — a purpose-built patient access request form — is the key differentiator for this organization and the focus of this assessment.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Erlanger is one of the organizations that clearly distinguishes between a patient exercising their right of access and a third-party release authorization. Form-3 is titled "Patient Request for Access to Health Information" and opens with the option to "give me a copy of my health information" — framing the interaction as a patient right rather than an authorization for disclosure. This is structurally separate from form-1, which serves as the general-purpose ROI authorization covering any release direction (to self, third party, insurer, attorney, etc.). The existence of this dedicated pathway shows deliberate organizational awareness that patient access and third-party release are different use cases with different legal frameworks.

However, the dedicated form originates from Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital (EWCH) and it is unclear from the form itself whether it applies system-wide. The general ROI form (form-1) does include a "_________myself" option in the "Release Information To" field, providing an alternate pathway through the broader form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. All three were surfaced through a single web search, with no login walls, bot blocking, or broken links. The main erlanger.org site hosts a Medical Records page under patient tools. Form-3's URL is under a "murphy" path that may be associated with a specific facility building, making it less discoverable via direct site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the primary patient access form, is a single-page, digitally authored PDF with a text layer — not a scan. However, it has **zero fillable fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The layout is clean and logical, flowing from patient identification through facility selection, date range, record type checkboxes, format preference, delivery method, and signature. The language is notably plain and patient-friendly, using first-person phrasing: "I would like," "I want these parts of my record." The form provides granular record selection with 18 options across hospital and office/clinic categories, giving patients meaningful control over scope.

Form-1 (the general ROI) is also digitally authored with a text layer but no fillable fields (2 pages, 14+ record type options). Form-2 (behavioral health) is an image-only scan — inaccessible to screen readers and impossible to fill electronically.

## Submission Methods

Form-3 does not clearly state how to submit the completed form. An "EWCH Use Only" section with "ID Verified" checkboxes implies in-person submission may be expected. However, the broader Erlanger system accepts fax submissions — form-2's instruction page provides a fax number for the HIM department, and form-1 includes fax as a contact/delivery option. Mail is also available. No online portal or email submission option exists for the forms themselves, though secure email is offered as a records *delivery* method.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness requirements exist. The primary patient access form (form-3) is completely silent on fees — patients have no idea if they will be charged. Form-1 mentions "charges may apply" for CD and paper copies but does not specify amounts. Form-3 notes a 30-day turnaround, consistent with HIPAA requirements. Both form-1 and form-3 request the last 4 digits of SSN, which is unnecessary when combined with name, DOB, and medical record number. Form-1 bundles sensitive-category consent (substance abuse, HIV, mental health) with no opt-out mechanism, which may raise 42 CFR Part 2 concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** distinct from third-party release — a meaningful structural choice
- **Plain-language, first-person framing** that is unusually patient-friendly
- **Granular record type selection** (18 options across hospital and clinic settings)
- **Secure email as a delivery option** for receiving records
- **Single-page simplicity** for the patient access form

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No fillable fields** on any form — all require print-and-handwrite workflow
- **No fee disclosure** on the patient access form
- **Unclear submission process** for form-3 (implies in-person with ID verification)
- **No patient rights statement** on the dedicated access form
- **Behavioral health form (form-2)** is an image-only scan with production errors (placeholder text left in)

## Overall Assessment

Erlanger demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness by offering a dedicated patient access form with plain language and granular record selection. The organizational awareness that patient access differs from third-party release is commendable. However, the complete absence of fillable fields, unclear submission instructions, and lack of fee transparency prevent the experience from being truly streamlined. The overall pathway earns a **B** — solid design intent held back by technical and process execution gaps.
