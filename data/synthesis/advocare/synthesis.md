# Advocare, LLC — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Advocare, LLC provides three downloaded authorization forms and an online submission alternative:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): The current English-language "Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Protected Health Information," a 2-page fillable PDF with 41 interactive fields, revised January 2026. Linked directly from the official medical records page.
- **form-3.pdf**: A Spanish-language translation of the same authorization form, dated January 2024, with 44 fillable fields. Also linked from the medical records page.
- **form-1.pdf** (legacy): An older single-page version (v2, April 2021) found on a different CDN path, likely from an individual practice sub-site. It has zero fillable fields and includes a Social Security Number field that the current version removed.

Beyond the downloadable PDFs, Advocare's medical records page offers an **online request option via ShareCare** and a separate third-party requester portal. The PDF forms list mail and email as delivery options, and fax is implicitly available through their practice offices.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Advocare does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form distinct from third-party release. All three PDF forms are general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for disclosure to third parties. However, form-2 includes a **"Patient Request" checkbox** under the purpose field, acknowledging patient-initiated requests. The structural awkwardness remains: a patient requesting their own records must still fill out "recipient" fields, essentially listing themselves as the party receiving disclosure. This is a common industry pattern but reflects a third-party-release mindset rather than a patient-access-first design.

The ShareCare online portal provides an alternative pathway, though it was not evaluated as a downloaded form in this study.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding Advocare's forms was **easy**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the dedicated medical records page, which clearly links to downloadable PDFs in English and Spanish, the ShareCare online portal, and a third-party requester portal. No bot blocking, authentication, or browser workarounds were needed. The only minor issue is that the legacy form-1.pdf remains discoverable via web search, creating a risk that patients could find and submit an outdated document.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2.pdf is a **born-digital, fillable PDF** with 41 interactive fields — a significant improvement over the legacy form-1 (which had zero fillable fields). The layout follows a logical flow: patient demographics → sending/receiving provider → purpose → date range → record types → sensitive categories → attestation → signature. The two-column sender/recipient layout is efficient, and the form includes 12 record-type checkboxes plus an "Abstract Record" shortcut (last year of encounters and results).

The language is a mix of standard HIPAA authorization phrasing and reasonably clear instructions. While not truly plain-language, it is accessible to most adults. One notable defect: the PDF contains a duplicated/garbled heading ("Select from thethe following...") — a layout error. The fillable fields also lack accessible names, which would impact screen reader users.

The Spanish version (form-3) is a high-quality professional translation with fillable fields, though it lacks the email delivery option present in the English form — a functional parity gap.

## Barriers and Red Flags

- **No notarization or witness required** — appropriate.
- **No in-person submission requirement** — mail, email, and online (ShareCare) are available.
- **No fees disclosed** on the form — neither good nor bad, but not transparent.
- **No SSN field** on the current form (the legacy form-1 did collect SSN — a red flag that was corrected).
- **90-day default expiration** is shorter than the industry-typical 6 months, potentially requiring re-authorization if processing is slow.
- **30-day response timeline** is clearly stated, correctly reflecting HIPAA requirements.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual forms**: Offering a professionally translated Spanish form alongside English is uncommon and valuable, especially in a Northeast practice.
- **"Abstract Record" option**: Provides a practical shortcut for patients who want a summary without selecting individual record types.
- **Reference Guide**: Page 2 defines sensitive information categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, reproductive services) in plain language with NJ law citations.
- **Email delivery option**: Explicitly offers electronic delivery alongside mail.
- **Online submission via ShareCare**: Provides a fully digital alternative to the PDF workflow.

## Overall Assessment

Advocare demonstrates above-average patient-centeredness for an independent physician practice. Forms are easy to find, fillable, available in two languages, and offer electronic submission. The main gap is the lack of a dedicated patient self-access pathway — patients must navigate a general-purpose authorization form designed around third-party disclosure. The "Patient Request" checkbox partially addresses this, but the form's structure still assumes a sender-to-recipient model that doesn't map cleanly to individual access rights. This is a solid B-level performance: competent, accessible, and showing genuine attention to patient needs, with room for improvement in truly centering the patient access experience.
