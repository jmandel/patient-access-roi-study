# Millinocket Regional Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Millinocket Regional Hospital provides a single downloadable PDF form: an **"Authorization to Release Health Care Information"** document hosted on its website since at least 2014. This is the only records-related form found for the organization. There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The sole pathway for a patient requesting records is to download this two-page PDF, print it, fill it out by hand, and submit it — most likely via fax to the number listed in the form header ((207) 723-3019).

## Patient Access vs. Third-Party Release

The form does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. It is structured entirely around a third-party disclosure model: the patient authorizes "Name of Institution" to disclose records to another "Name of Institution or Person." A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly fill in themselves as the recipient, with no guidance on how to do so. The "reason for release" field offers only "continuing care" or "other (please specify)" — there is no option for "personal records request" or "individual access under HIPAA." This is a generic HIPAA authorization form repurposed for all release scenarios.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form required persistence. Two generic web searches returned no results; only a site-scoped query (`site:mrhme.org`) succeeded. The form does not appear to be prominently linked from a patient resources or medical records page. The URL path (`/2014/06/`) suggests the document has not been updated in over a decade. Once located, the download was straightforward — no bot blocking or browser fallback needed.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **flat PDF with zero fillable fields**. All data entry uses underscore blanks designed for handwriting. The document has a text layer (not a scan) and uses four fonts, but it is fundamentally a print-and-fill artifact. The layout lacks section headers, visual hierarchy, or any design elements beyond bold title text. Record types are presented as an 18-item list (a–r) using an unusual **opt-out approach**: items are released unless crossed out, which uses double-negative logic that could easily confuse patients.

The form covers patient identification, sender/recipient institution, record type selection, reason for release, sensitive information consent (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric), and signature lines — approximately 25 fields across two pages. The language is mostly plain but includes alarming legalese: *"refusal or revocation of permission may result in improper diagnosis or treatment, denial of health benefits or insurance, or other adverse consequences"* — a warning that applies to third-party release scenarios but could discourage a patient exercising their right of access.

## Barriers & Red Flags

The form mandates: *"All spaces on this form MUST be completed for this release to be valid."* This blanket requirement goes beyond HIPAA's authorization elements and could be used to reject forms with trivially missing information. A **witness signature line** is included; combined with the all-fields-mandatory language, this effectively requires a witness — a barrier HIPAA does not impose. No fees are mentioned, no response time is stated, and no delivery format options are offered.

## Bright Spots

The **18-category record-type checklist** provides meaningful granularity, including unusual categories like "Patient Additions" and "Responses to Patients Additions." The **sensitive information consent sections** correctly reference redisclosure restrictions for substance abuse records under 42 CFR Part 2. The form does include a brief patient rights statement acknowledging the right to review records and revoke authorization.

## Overall Assessment

Millinocket Regional Hospital's records request process reflects a facility that has not modernized its patient access pathway. A single generic third-party release form — non-fillable, hard to find, and over a decade old — serves as the only documented mechanism. The form was not designed for patient self-access and contains unnecessary barriers (witness requirement, all-fields-mandatory mandate). While fax submission is available and the form provides good record-type granularity, the overall experience falls well short of patient-centered design.
