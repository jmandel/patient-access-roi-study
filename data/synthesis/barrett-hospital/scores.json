      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Patient self-access is an afterthought — the form is a generic third-party authorization with no distinction for individual access rights; 'Personal Use' is merely one circled option among several purposes."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The conditioning language ('refusal may affect treatment or payment') goes beyond what the law allows for patient access requests, and SSN collection is unnecessary, though redisclosure and 42 CFR Part 2 notices are properly included."
