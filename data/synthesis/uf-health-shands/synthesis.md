# UF Health Shands Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

UF Health Shands Hospital, a major nonprofit teaching hospital in Gainesville, Florida, offers patients a single general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for all record requests. Four versions of this form (form family PS46283/RI0001) were found online, but only one — form-2.pdf, revised 5/30/19 — is linked from the official medical records page. No dedicated patient self-access pathway exists; patients requesting their own records use the same authorization form designed for third-party release.

## Forms and Pathways

The primary form (form-2.pdf) is a single-page, born-digital PDF linked from ufhealth.org/medical-records. Three additional variants persist online: form-1.pdf (a 2015 revision with more detailed identity verification and numbered sections), form-3.pdf (a 2014 legacy version with a liability waiver and HealthPort electronic delivery), and form-4.pdf (a clinic-specific variant pre-filled for the Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment). All share the same form code and general structure. The coexistence of multiple undifferentiated versions at different URLs creates a risk that patients or providers encounter outdated forms via search engines.

Submission options are mail and fax, both clearly printed on form-2. The medical records page also lists a phone number. An in-person pick-up option is noted on the form. Fax provides an adequate electronic submission pathway per the scoring baseline.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

UF Health Shands does **not** offer a differentiated patient self-access pathway. The form is titled "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — the HIPAA authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than the Right of Access framework (§ 164.524). The sole accommodation for patients requesting their own records is a small "Check here if same as patient" checkbox in the "To" field. The form does not reference the patient's Right of Access, does not distinguish fee structures for patient access versus third-party release, and does not include any language framing the request as an individual access right.

That said, the form does include "Personal Use" as an explicit purpose option, and the identity verification fields in the representative section are marked "Internal use only," appropriately sparing patients from producing documentation at the time of form completion.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is a cleanly designed, born-digital single-page PDF — but it has **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally composed (8 fonts, no embedded images, only 95 KB), the form requires printing and handwriting. This is a persistent gap across all four form versions, suggesting an organizational decision rather than a legacy issue.

The layout is logical: patient demographics → from/to routing → facility selection → record types → dates/purpose/format → legal disclosures → signature → representative section. Sixteen record-type checkboxes (including separated sensitive-information categories for behavioral health, substance use disorder, STD/HIV/AIDS, and genetic testing) provide excellent granularity. The legal disclosure section uses reasonably clear language with helpful parentheticals (e.g., "revoke it in writing (i.e., tell UF Health to cancel it)"), though the opening corporate entity definition paragraph is dense legalese.

Delivery format options include MyUFHealth (the patient portal), CD, and paper — the portal option is a notable modern addition, though it serves as a delivery mechanism rather than a request submission channel.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization, witness signatures, or in-person submission is required. Authorization expires after one year with clear revocation rights. However, the fee disclosure — "up to $1.00 per page (plus applicable tax and handling) for Paper Records" — is applied uniformly without distinguishing patient access from third-party release. For patient self-access under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4), HIPAA limits fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts; the $1.00/page rate (reflecting Florida's statutory schedule for third-party releases) may exceed this standard. No response time commitment is stated.

The older form-3 includes a liability waiver ("I hereby release and discharge UF Health...from any liability"), which is an additional barrier not present in the current primary form.

## Overall Assessment

UF Health Shands provides an easily findable, well-organized, and compact authorization form, but falls short in two critical areas: (1) the complete absence of fillable PDF fields forces a paper-based workflow, and (2) the generic authorization framework fails to differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. The fee language, while standard for Florida third-party releases, is potentially non-compliant when applied to patient access requests. The form earns credit for its granular record-type selection, explicit "Personal Use" purpose option, MyUFHealth portal delivery, and patient-friendly touches like marking verification fields as internal-use-only — but these bright spots don't compensate for the fundamental lack of a patient-centered access pathway and the print-and-handwrite workflow.
