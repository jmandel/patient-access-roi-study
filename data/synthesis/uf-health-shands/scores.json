    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Primarily a paper workflow — despite being born-digital, the PDF has zero fillable fields across all four form versions, requiring patients to print and handwrite; fax submission is available but the form completion itself is entirely paper-based."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — logical single-page layout with clear section flow, 16 granular record-type checkboxes, and reasonably plain language; minor issues include dense corporate entity definition paragraph and visual density from fitting all content on one page."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic authorization framework treats patient self-access identically to third-party release, with only a 'Check here if same as patient' checkbox as accommodation; no Right of Access language, though 'Personal Use' purpose option and internal-only verification fields show some awareness."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires for patient access — the $1.00/page fee disclosure does not distinguish patient access (subject to HIPAA cost-based limits) from third-party release (subject to state fee schedules); no notarization or in-person barriers, and clear revocation rights partially offset this concern."

      "summary": "UF Health Shands provides an easily findable and well-organized authorization form but is held back by a fully paper-based workflow (no fillable fields), a generic authorization framework that does not differentiate patient self-access, and per-page fee language that may exceed HIPAA limits for individual access requests."
