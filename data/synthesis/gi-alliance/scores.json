    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: primarily a paper workflow — the form is text-based (not a scan) but has zero fillable fields, no electronic signature, and no submission pathway specified; patient must print, handwrite, and determine submission method independently."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: adequate but with notable problems — the single-page format is concise and logically ordered, but uses legalistic language ('d/b/a', 'HIPAA Affiliated Covered Entity'), lacks section headers, has no instructional text, and leaves critical fields (provider name, revocation address) blank."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: a patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the 'Patient's Request' checkbox makes the generic authorization usable for self-access, but the form doesn't reference patient rights, offer delivery format choices, or distinguish self-access from third-party release."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: some requirements or language that may go beyond what the law requires — the form includes all required HIPAA authorization elements (expiration, revocation, non-conditioning) but conflates §164.508 authorization with §164.524 patient access, has no fee disclosure, and blank address fields undermine revocation rights."
