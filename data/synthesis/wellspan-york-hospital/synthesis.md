# WellSpan York Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

WellSpan York Hospital is part of WellSpan Health, a regional nonprofit health system in Pennsylvania. The organization publishes two ROI authorization forms at the system level on wellspan.org. **Form-1.pdf** ("Authorization to Use or Disclose Health Information," Form #2606, Rev. 08/25) is the primary system-wide form applicable to York Hospital and all other WellSpan facilities. **Form-2.pdf** ("Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information") is scoped exclusively to three WellSpan neighborhood hospitals (Newberry, Shrewsbury, Carlisle) and does not apply to York Hospital. The assessment below focuses on form-1.pdf as the relevant patient pathway.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

WellSpan does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access form or pathway distinct from third-party release. Form-1.pdf is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization with a bidirectional "Obtain from" / "Disclose to" structure designed for third-party transfers. However, the form does include a "Personal" purpose checkbox and an unusually clear statement of the right to self-access: *"I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party."* This language partially compensates for the lack of a dedicated pathway, but a patient must still navigate a form framed around releasing records to another party and figure out how to adapt it for self-access (e.g., writing their own name in the "Disclose to" field).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was effortless. A straightforward web search immediately returned a direct PDF link on wellspan.org. No login walls, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering was required. Multiple search strategies all converged on the same document. This is among the easiest retrieval experiences in the study.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1.pdf is a 2-page, born-digital PDF with a complete text layer — but **zero fillable fields**. Despite being digitally created, all fields are blank underscored lines, requiring patients to print and complete by hand. This is a significant missed opportunity. The layout is clean and logically organized: patient identification flows into record source/destination, then record type selection, purpose, delivery format, sensitive-records disclosure, legal terms, signatures, and submission instructions. The language is mostly plain and accessible, though the sensitive-records paragraph on page 1 is a dense run-on sentence that could benefit from formatting improvements.

Record type options are well structured with five top-level categories (Abstract with detailed sub-list, Diagnostic Test Results, Imaging, Billing, and Complete record). Delivery format options are a standout feature: patients can choose Paper, CD, Fax, or Email, where the email option delivers records through a secure portal as PDFs available for 30 days.

## Barriers & Compliance

The form requests the last 4 digits of the patient's SSN — an unnecessary data collection practice that introduces privacy risk without being required for patient identification. A witness signature line on page 2 creates ambiguity about whether a witness is routinely required or only for specific circumstances. Fees are mentioned as "regulated by state and federal law" but no specific amounts are disclosed. Notably, form processing is handled by MRO Corporation, a third-party ROI vendor, meaning patients interact with MRO rather than WellSpan directly.

On the positive side: the form explicitly accepts copies in lieu of originals, does not require notarization, and clearly states that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing. The 12-month authorization window is reasonable.

## Submission Methods

Patients can submit the completed form via **fax** (717-812-8119), **email** (PatientRequests@wellspan.org), or **mail** to the York, PA HIM office. The availability of fax and email means patients are not required to physically visit the facility or rely solely on postal mail.

## Overall Assessment

WellSpan York Hospital provides an easily findable, reasonably well-designed authorization form with modern delivery options (secure portal) and explicit right-to-self language. However, the absence of fillable fields in a born-digital PDF, the generic third-party authorization structure, the SSN collection, and witness ambiguity prevent it from reaching the top tier. The organization serves patients adequately but has clear room for improvement in both digital accessibility and patient-centered design.
