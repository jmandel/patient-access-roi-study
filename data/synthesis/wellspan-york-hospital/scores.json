      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form is a generic third-party authorization with 'Obtain from'/'Disclose to' structure; patients must adapt it for self-access, though the 'Personal' checkbox and explicit right-to-self language help."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
