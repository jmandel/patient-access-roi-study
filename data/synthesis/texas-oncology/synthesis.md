# Texas Oncology — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms & Pathways Available

Texas Oncology provides a single ROI form — an "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" — in both English (form-1.pdf) and Spanish (form-2.pdf). Both are 3-page fillable PDFs, structurally identical, revised 09/19/2024. They are available as direct downloads from a dedicated Medical Records page at texasoncology.com/medical-records. The page outlines a clear 3-step process: download the form, complete it, and submit by fax or mail.

No patient portal submission, online request wizard, or third-party vendor platform (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was found. The only request pathway is the downloadable PDF form submitted by fax or mail.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Texas Oncology does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party disclosure. The single form is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization covering nine disclosure reasons — Treatment, Personal Use, Billing, Legal Purposes, Disability Determination, School, Employment, Health Oversight, and Other. A patient requesting their own records must select "Personal Use" and then navigate fields designed for third-party scenarios, including filling in both "I authorize the following to disclose" (naming Texas Oncology) and "Who can receive and use the health information?" (naming themselves). This is awkward when the requester and recipient are the same person.

Notably, page 2 of the form includes a legally accurate statement that "This form is not required for the permissible disclosure of an individual's protected health information to the individual," citing 45 CFR §§ 164.502(a)(1)(i) and 164.524. However, this critical information is buried in supplementary legal text — not surfaced on page 1 where a patient would see it before completing the 3-page form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The Medical Records page is accessible from footer navigation (approximately one click from the homepage). While older PDF URLs found via web search returned 404 errors due to a site migration to Sitecore Edge CDN, the live page links worked without issue. No bot blocking, login walls, or captchas were encountered. Overall retrieval difficulty: easy to moderate — the slight complication was dead legacy URLs, but the current page is well-organized.

## Form Document Quality

The English form is a well-constructed fillable PDF with 95 interactive fields — a thoroughly digitized form designed for on-screen completion. The layout is clean and logical: patient demographics → reason for disclosure → authorizing party → recipient → delivery method → record types → time period → signature. Section headers in all caps provide clear visual hierarchy.

The form offers 16 checkboxes for specific record types (lab results, radiology reports, pathology, etc.) plus "All Health Information" and "Other," giving patients meaningful granularity. Four sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, genetic information, HIV/AIDS) require separate initialing, consistent with HIPAA and Texas law.

The language is reasonably plain for a legal authorization form. The statement that treatment cannot be denied for refusing to sign is prominently placed at the top of page 1 — better positioning than many ROI forms. However, the fee language on page 2 contains a grammatical error ("There may charge a retrieval/processing fee") and fails to specify amounts or distinguish patient-access fees from third-party disclosure fees.

The 95 fillable fields lack semantic names in the PDF metadata (all field names are empty), which impairs accessibility for screen readers and assistive technology.

## Barriers & Compliance

**Barriers are low to moderate.** No notarization is required — only a patient signature. No in-person submission is required; fax and mail are both accepted. The authorization expiration is reasonable (valid until death, revocation, or optional specified date). Right to revoke is clearly stated. The form includes current reproductive health protections (45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)) with a dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page — demonstrating up-to-date compliance with 2024 federal rules.

The main barrier is the lack of electronic submission: despite the fillable PDF and email as a records *delivery* option, patients must still print, sign, and fax or mail the form. There is no e-signature, portal upload, or online submission pathway.

Fee disclosure is vague — "a retrieval/processing fee may be charged" without specifics. No response time commitment is stated.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: A professionally translated Spanish version is offered as a parallel download — commendable for a Texas-based practice serving a significant Spanish-speaking population.
- **Reproductive health protections**: The dedicated Prohibited Use Attestation page is current with 2024 federal law.
- **Email delivery option**: Records can be delivered via email, providing a practical electronic access mechanism.
- **Treatment-not-conditioned**: Prominently positioned at the top of page 1.

## Overall Assessment

Texas Oncology provides a competent but generic records request experience. The form is well-built as a document — fillable, logically organized, bilingual, and legally current. However, it funnels patients through a third-party authorization process rather than offering a dedicated patient access pathway. The buried acknowledgment that the form "is not required" for patient self-access only underscores this mismatch. A patient can successfully request their records, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience. The organization earns a **B** grade — solid document quality and accessibility, held back by the lack of a patient-centered access pathway.
