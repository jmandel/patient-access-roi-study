      "score": 4,

      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor issues — logical flow, clear all-caps section headers, 16 granular record-type checkboxes, and plain-language opening instructions; minor deductions for grammatical error in fee language and unlabeled PDF form fields."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — generic authorization form requires selecting 'Personal Use' from nine options and filling in confusing self-referencing fields; buried page 2 note that the form 'is not required' for patient self-access underscores the mismatch."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but no material impediments — no notarization, no in-person requirement, right to revoke clearly stated, treatment-not-conditioned prominent, current reproductive health protections; vague fee language and no response time commitment are minor gaps."
