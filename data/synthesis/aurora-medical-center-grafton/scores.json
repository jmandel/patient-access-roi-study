    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds — the PDF has a text layer but zero fillable fields, requiring print-and-handwrite workflow; however, fax and email submission are available as electronic submission options."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor issues — the single-page form has logical flow, clear section headers, granular record selection, and plain language, though the dense single-page layout results in small text and tight spacing."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 5,
      "rationale": "Level 5: Process designed around patient self-access as a first-class use case — Aurora provides a dedicated 'Patient Request for Health Information' form clearly distinct from the third-party authorization, with a 'Myself' checkbox, no purpose-of-release requirement, and a prominent patient portal callout."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization required, non-discrimination language present, proper minor authorization; the only gap is the vague '(Fees may apply)' without amounts or fee schedule."
