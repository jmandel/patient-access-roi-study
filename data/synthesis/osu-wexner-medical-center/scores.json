      "score": 4,

      "score": 3,

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Requires purpose of disclosure for all requests (not required by HIPAA for patient access), fee opacity through CIOX Health with no schedule provided; offset by no notarization requirement, appropriate anti-conditioning language, and correct sensitive-records disclosures."
