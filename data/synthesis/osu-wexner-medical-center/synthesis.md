# Synthesis: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center

## Forms and Pathways

OSU Wexner Medical Center publishes two PDF forms on its [Medical Records page](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/patient-and-visitor-guide/medical-records), both titled "Authorization to Release Medical Information" (form ID MC040184, revised 11/2019). Form-1 is a single-page image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields — essentially a digitized paper artifact. Form-2 is a two-page digitally authored PDF that bundles numbered instructions (page 1) with the same authorization form (page 2). Form-2 has a full text layer and 25 embedded fonts but, despite being created in Adobe Acrobat Pro, still has zero fillable fields. Both forms use the same layout and legal text. Form-2 is clearly the better document and serves as the basis for this assessment.

The organization does not appear to offer a patient portal-based records request, an online submission wizard (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant), or any other digital request pathway. Submission instructions list three physical mailing addresses and phone numbers for the Medical Information Management offices. No fax number or email address is listed for submitting the completed form. The form does accept eSignatures ("e.g., Adobe") with a date and time stamp, which opens the possibility that a patient could fill the form digitally using annotation tools and email or fax it — but no such submission channel is explicitly provided on the form itself.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

OSU Wexner does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The same "Authorization to Release Medical Information" form is used whether a patient wants their own records or an attorney, insurer, or other third party is requesting them. The form's "Release Information To" section uses a sender-recipient model without any acknowledgment that a patient requesting their own records has distinct rights under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). There is no mention of the Right of Access anywhere on either form. Patients must complete the same "Purpose of Disclosure" field (with no guidance that they are not legally required to state a purpose for their own records), select facilities, and navigate the same legal text as any third-party requester.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search returned direct download links on the first attempt, and the forms are clearly linked from the organization's Medical Records page. No bot blocking, login walls, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The only minor friction is the presence of two versions of the same form without guidance on which to use — a patient might download the image-only scan (form-1) and have a worse experience.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2's instructions page is a genuine bright spot: seven numbered items correspond to form sections, with practical guidance like "If uncertain about the location, select all box locations." The form itself offers granular record-type checkboxes (11 categories including Emergency Dept, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, Radiology, Pathology, etc.), multi-facility selection across 8 OSU locations, and reasonable purpose-of-disclosure options. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow. However, the form page is quite dense — it packs all fields, checkboxes, four paragraphs of legal text, signature lines, and three submission address blocks onto a single page, resulting in small font sizes and cramped spacing. The language mixes accessible instructions with HIPAA-derived terms ("designated record set," "re-disclosed by the recipient") that may confuse patients. Critically, despite being authored in Acrobat Pro, the form has no fillable fields — patients must print and handwrite.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant barrier is fee opacity. The form states "a fee may be charged" and directs all billing questions to CIOX Health (1-800-367-1500), a third-party ROI vendor, without any fee schedule or distinction between patient-access and third-party fees. For patient self-access, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts; the lack of transparency here raises concerns. The instructions require "all sections must be completed in their entirety," which means patients must state a purpose — not required by HIPAA for individual access. No notarization is required, and the witness signature is optional, which is positive. The form has not been updated since November 2019, predating the 2021 information blocking rules and 2024 42 CFR Part 2 revisions.

## Bright Spots

- Dedicated, well-structured instructions page with numbered items
- Granular record-type selection (11 categories)
- Multi-facility selection with practical guidance for uncertain patients
- eSignature acceptance (Adobe)
- Correct substance use disorder and psychotherapy notes disclosures

## Overall Assessment

OSU Wexner Medical Center provides a findable, reasonably organized ROI form with useful instructions, but falls short on digital accessibility (no fillable fields, no electronic submission channel), patient-centeredness (no differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release), and fee transparency. The process is fundamentally a print-and-mail paper workflow dressed in a PDF wrapper.
