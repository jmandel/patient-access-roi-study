# Riverwood Healthcare Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Riverwood Healthcare Center is an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Aitkin, MN. It maintains a Patient Forms page with multiple release-of-information documents and offers both printable PDF and online JotForm submission options. Three PDF forms were found (from 2015, 2018, and 2025), all general-purpose HIPAA authorization forms for releasing patient information. The organization also uses MyChart (OCHIN) for patient portal access, though this is not positioned as a records request channel on the Patient Forms page.

## Available Forms and Pathways

The most relevant form for patient self-access is **form-3.pdf** (2025), the current "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" linked from the Patient Forms page as the "Printable Form." Two older versions (2018 and 2015) remain publicly accessible at their original WordPress upload URLs but are no longer linked from the main forms page. All three forms share essentially the same structure: patient demographics, release from/to fields, purpose checkboxes, record type selections, sensitive information opt-out, and standard HIPAA authorization language.

Critically, Riverwood also offers **HIPAA-compliant JotForm online submission** (https://hipaa.jotform.com/222405586410046) as an alternative to the printable PDF. This provides a fully digital workflow — no printing, handwriting, or faxing required. A second JotForm for "Consent for Release of Information" and a third for "Permission to Verbally Discuss PHI" are also available. These online options represent a meaningful accessibility advantage over the PDF-only approach.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Riverwood does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. All three PDF forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed for releasing information from one entity to another. A patient requesting their own records must use the same from/to structure intended for third-party transfers — listing themselves in the "Release Information To" field. The "Personal Use" purpose checkbox is available, signaling that self-requests are anticipated, but there is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA § 164.524 Right of Access, and no statement of patient rights.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms was **easy**. A simple web search for Riverwood's ROI form surfaced direct PDF links immediately. The Patient Forms page is accessible in one click from the main site navigation and provides organized links to both printable and online form options. The only concern is that outdated form versions (2015, 2018) remain publicly accessible, meaning a patient arriving via search engine could encounter a superseded form.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a **single-page, digitally composed PDF** with a clean layout, clear section headers, and notably helpful parenthetical plain-language guidance (e.g., "RELEASE INFORMATION FROM (WHO HAS THE INFORMATION YOU WANT RELEASED?)"). This design choice makes the form substantially more approachable than typical legal-style ROI forms.

However, the PDF has **zero fillable fields** — all checkboxes are Unicode characters (☐) rendered as text, not interactive elements. A patient must print and hand-fill the form. The JotForm alternative addresses this gap for patients who find it. The form does not collect Social Security Numbers (an improvement over the 2015 version, which did), and does not require a witness signature (also improved from the 2015 version).

Field count is reasonable at approximately 15–18 fields including demographics, from/to addresses, purpose, date range, record type selections, and signature. The authorization language is standard but dense, packed into two paragraphs with no visual breaks between concepts.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** on the current form — a positive.
- **Fax submission available** (218-927-5319), providing an electronic submission pathway beyond the JotForm.
- **No fees disclosed** on any form — appropriate for the authorization itself, though patients are not informed about potential costs.
- **Sensitive information defaults to release:** The form states "All information regarding chemical dependency will be released unless you restrict by initialing." This opt-out approach for 42 CFR Part 2–protected substance abuse records is the most significant compliance concern.
- **"Guardian" misspelled as "Gaurdian"** on the current form — a minor but unprofessional error.
- **Ambiguous revocation language:** The form requires patients to "present" written revocation to the Medical Records Department, which could be read as requiring in-person delivery.

## Overall Assessment

Riverwood Healthcare Center provides a **competent but undifferentiated** records request experience. The organization earns credit for easy findability, offering both printable and online submission options (via JotForm), and producing a clean single-page form with helpful plain-language guidance. The JotForm option is a genuine bright spot that elevates the digital experience. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the generic authorization form design, the non-fillable PDF, and the concerning opt-out model for sensitive information prevent a higher rating. This is a typical small critical access hospital approach — functional but not patient-centered.
