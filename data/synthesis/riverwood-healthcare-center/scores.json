      "score": 4,

      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — clean single-page layout with helpful parenthetical plain-language headers, logical section flow, and reasonable field count; minor issues include dense authorization language, 'Guardian' misspelled, and ambiguous opt-out initialing for sensitive records."

      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — generic HIPAA authorization form with 'Personal Use' checkbox accommodates self-requests, but no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA Right of Access, and patient must navigate a from/to structure designed for third-party transfers."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing that would materially impede a patient — no notarization, no witness, fax available, reasonable expiration; minor concerns include default-release model for 42 CFR Part 2 substance abuse records, ambiguous 'present' revocation language, and no fee disclosure."
