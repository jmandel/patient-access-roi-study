# TriStar Centennial Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

TriStar Centennial Medical Center is an HCA Healthcare–affiliated community hospital in Nashville, TN. Three documents were retrieved: the primary English-language HCA authorization form (form-1), a Spanish translation (form-3), and a separate form for Centennial Medical Group, an affiliated physician practice in Elkridge, MD (form-2). The hospital's own forms (form-1 and form-3) are the relevant documents for assessing this facility's patient access experience.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A web search for authorization/release form terms immediately surfaced the hospital's medical records page, which is clearly organized under For Patients → Medical Records. Both English and Spanish PDF download links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering, or portal login was required. The HCA Digital Asset Management URLs worked with a standard download. This is about as easy as form retrieval gets.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

TriStar Centennial does **not** offer a dedicated patient access form. The primary document (form-1) is a general-purpose "Authorization for Release of PHI" designed to serve both patient self-access and third-party release. The "Purpose of disclosure" field lists "At the request of the individual" as the first option, with "Other 3rd party recipient" as the alternative — but both flow through the same form, same fields, and same process. Patients must navigate Section B (marketing/sale of PHI disclosures) even when it doesn't apply, and the form's recipient fields are oriented toward third-party recipients rather than a simple "send me my records" workflow.

That said, the medical records page also offers a **Swellbox online portal** for digital submission and the **MyHealthONE patient portal** for direct record access, providing alternative pathways that may offer a more patient-centric experience. The existence of these portal options partially compensates for the generic form design.

## Form Document Quality

The primary HCA form (form-1) is technically excellent. It is a **digitally native, single-page PDF with 52 fillable fields** — covering every input from patient demographics to 16+ record-type checkboxes to delivery preferences. This is unusually thorough; many organizations provide flat, non-fillable PDFs that require printing and handwriting. The file is lean (170 KB, no embedded images, 9 fonts), confirming it was designed as a digital artifact rather than scanned from paper.

The form offers **four delivery format options** — paper copy, electronic media, encrypted email, and unencrypted email — which is above average. It includes a forward-looking **USCDI Release Request** option for structured health data exchange, though this feature is aimed at provider-to-provider use and would confuse most patients.

Layout is organized into three labeled sections (A: core authorization, B: marketing/sale disclosures, C: signatures), which provides logical structure. However, packing this much content into a single page means tight spacing and modest font sizes. The language is a mix of functional form labels and legal disclosures — the patient rights statements use reasonably plain first-person language ("I understand that…"), but passages like the unencrypted email risk disclaimer are dense.

The **Spanish translation** (form-3) is a full parallel version with identical structure and 52 fillable fields — not a scan or afterthought. A few staff-facing elements (footer text, "ID verified by" field) remain in English, but the patient-facing content is fully translated.

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes **no significant barriers**. No notarization or witness is required. The SSN field is explicitly marked optional. The 180-day default expiration is reasonable with options for custom dates. Psychotherapy notes are properly separated per HIPAA requirements. Fee language references a "reasonable copy fee" without specifying amounts — appropriate, though it gives patients no cost visibility.

Submission options include **fax (844-481-0298) and mail**, plus the Swellbox portal for fully digital submission. A patient can complete and submit without physically visiting the facility.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual fillable PDFs**: Both English and Spanish versions with 52 interactive fields each, directly linked from the same page
- **USCDI release option**: Rare acknowledgment of interoperability standards on an ROI form
- **Multiple delivery formats**: Four options including encrypted email
- **Portal alternatives**: Swellbox and MyHealthONE provide digital-first pathways beyond the PDF
- **10-day turnaround** (on the CMG form) and clear contact information

## Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access pathway**: The generic authorization form doesn't distinguish individual access rights from third-party release
- **Default to paper delivery**: If the delivery section is left blank, the patient gets paper — an electronic default would be more patient-friendly
- **Dense single page**: The amount of content compressed onto one page may challenge patients with limited literacy or visual impairments
- **Minor grammatical error**: "I may see and obtain a copy the information" is missing "of"

## Overall Assessment

TriStar Centennial earns a **B grade**. The technical quality of its forms is strong — fillable fields, bilingual availability, multiple delivery options, and a clean digital PDF. Retrieval is effortless. Compliance posture is solid with no unnecessary barriers. The main shortcoming is the absence of a patient-centric access pathway: a patient requesting their own records navigates the same authorization form as an insurer or attorney, with no differentiation in process, language, or workflow. The availability of portal alternatives (Swellbox, MyHealthONE) partially mitigates this, but the core PDF experience doesn't center the patient as an individual exercising their right of access.
