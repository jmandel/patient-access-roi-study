# Synthesis: Essentia Health-Fosston

## Overview

Essentia Health-Fosston is a critical access hospital in Fosston, MN, part of the regional nonprofit Essentia Health system. The facility does not maintain its own medical records forms; it uses system-wide Essentia Health documents for all records-related processes. Four documents were retrieved, but only one — the "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" (form-1, EH10843 12/25) — is relevant for a patient requesting copies of their medical records. The other three documents serve adjacent purposes: MyChart portal enrollment (form-2), MyChart proxy access delegation (form-3), and verbal information-sharing authorization (form-4).

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Dedicated Patient Access

Essentia Health does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting records on behalf of someone else. Form-1 is a general-purpose authorization with "From" and "To" fields designed for transferring records between entities. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both fields — putting themselves as the recipient — and check "Personal use" as the reason. There is no dedicated patient access form, no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and no tailored instructions for self-access requests. That said, Essentia Health does offer meaningful alternatives: the medical records page directs patients to **MyChart** as the primary access pathway and provides a **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** as a fully digital alternative to the PDF form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A basic web search immediately surfaced the direct PDF link, and Essentia Health's medical records page (`essentiahealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records`) is well-organized with clearly labeled download links. No bot-blocking or browser fallback was required. The URL structure is clean and descriptive. All forms are hosted on the main Essentia Health domain (except the MyChart-related forms on `essentiamychart.org`).

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page**, digitally-designed PDF with a complete text layer — impressively compact for the scope it covers. The layout follows a logical flow from patient demographics through release details, record type selection, delivery method, and legal notices. The form offers strong record type granularity with 18+ individual checkboxes plus an "All Routine Records" shortcut, and appropriately separates behavioral health and substance use disorder records with distinct opt-in/opt-out controls.

However, the form has **zero fillable fields** despite being digitally composed. All data entry uses blank underscores, requiring print-and-handwrite completion. This is a consistent pattern across all four Essentia Health forms and appears to be a deliberate system-wide design choice rather than a per-form oversight. The delivery method options are a bright spot: patients can receive records via MyChart, email, fax, or mail (paper or disc).

## Barriers and Compliance

The form imposes no unusual barriers — no notarization, no witness requirement (except for mark-based signatures), no in-person-only submission. Submission is available via email, fax, or mail. Fee language is vague: "I may be required to pay a fee for retrieval and photocopying of records," citing state statutes rather than HIPAA cost-based fee limits, with no specific amounts disclosed. The form properly includes anti-conditioning language, revocation rights, psychotherapy note protections, and 42 CFR Part 2 SUD protections. One notable issue: the MyChart enrollment forms (form-2, form-3) collect partial SSN, which is unnecessary for portal access and creates data minimization concerns.

## Notable Strengths

- **Swellbox/Datavant online request wizard** provides a fully digital alternative pathway
- **Single-page form** — remarkably compact for comprehensive ROI coverage
- **Electronic delivery options** including email and MyChart — not just fax/mail
- **Multi-state legal compliance** across MN, WI, and ND
- **Recently revised** (December 2025), indicating active form maintenance
- **Well-organized medical records page** with clear navigation and multiple pathway options

## Notable Weaknesses

- **No dedicated patient access form** — patients must navigate a generic third-party authorization
- **Zero fillable fields** across all four system forms — entirely print-and-handwrite
- **Vague fee disclosure** with no specific amounts or HIPAA cost-based fee reference
- **Form-3 (MyChart proxy)** published as a proof copy with no text layer — inaccessible to screen readers
- **Behavioral health opt-out vs. SUD opt-in** inconsistency may confuse patients

## Overall Assessment

Essentia Health-Fosston earns a **B grade**. The organization benefits from its parent system's well-organized web presence, a compact and recently-updated authorization form, and the availability of a digital request portal. The main limitations are the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway (patients must use a generic third-party authorization form) and the absence of fillable fields on any PDF form. The Swellbox portal partially compensates for the PDF's technical shortcomings, and the multiple electronic submission and delivery options keep the process accessible. A patient can successfully request their records without visiting the facility, but the process isn't designed around them.
