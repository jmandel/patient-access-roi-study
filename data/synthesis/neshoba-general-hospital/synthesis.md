# Neshoba General Hospital — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Neshoba General Hospital is an independent, government-owned critical access hospital in Philadelphia, Mississippi. The hospital's website (neshobageneral.com) provides basic information about services, visiting policies, and financial resources, but entirely lacks any patient-facing pathway for requesting medical records online.

## Available Forms and Pathways

After an exhaustive search — nine different web queries, full website navigation across all patient-facing pages, URL guessing for common PDF paths, Wayback Machine archive review, and third-party ROI vendor checks — **no Release of Information or medical records request form was found online**. The only authorization-adjacent document discovered was an "Employer Authorization Form" (form-1.pdf), a fillable PDF designed for employers to authorize employee visits for occupational health services (DOT physicals, drug testing, workers' compensation). This form has no relevance to patient self-access of health records.

The hospital's website has no "Medical Records" or "Health Information Management" section. No HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices PDF is published. The only apparent way for a patient to initiate a records request is to call (601) 663-1200 or visit in person.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neshoba General Hospital does not differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release because it provides **no publicly accessible pathway for either**. There is no dedicated patient access form, no generic HIPAA authorization form, no online portal, and no third-party vendor (such as Ciox/Datavant or HealthMark) handling records requests. Patients are left entirely without guidance on how to exercise their HIPAA Right of Access from the website.

## Retrieval Experience

The retrieval difficulty was **hard**. Multiple search strategies were systematically attempted and all failed to locate an ROI form. No bot-blocking or technical barriers were encountered — the forms simply do not exist on the website. The Wayback Machine confirmed that no ROI form has ever been indexed from this domain. The hospital's website is minimal, built by Scorpion Healthcare Marketing, and lacks many standard patient resource sections.

## Form Document Quality

Because no ROI form exists online, there is no patient-facing form to evaluate for document quality. Ironically, the Employer Authorization Form demonstrates that the hospital is technically capable of producing well-designed, fillable PDF forms — it features 54 interactive fields on a single well-structured page with clear section headers and logical organization. This capability has not been applied to patient records access.

## Barriers and Red Flags

The most significant barrier is the complete absence of any online records request pathway. Patients must contact the hospital by phone or visit in person merely to learn how to begin the process. Additional concerns include:

- No Medical Records or HIM department page on the website
- No published Notice of Privacy Practices (only a generic website privacy policy)
- No indication of fees, turnaround times, or patient rights related to records access
- No mention of any patient portal-based records request option (the site references a Cerner/HealtheLife patient portal, but it is behind login with no public information about records request functionality)

## Notable Strengths

The only bright spot is indirect: the employer authorization form's quality suggests the hospital has the technical infrastructure to produce good digital forms if it chose to extend that capability to patient records access.

## Overall Assessment

Neshoba General Hospital represents one of the weakest possible configurations for patient records access. A patient visiting the website looking to request their own health records would find no form, no instructions, no department contact information, and no explanation of their rights. The complete absence of any digital pathway — not even a downloadable PDF to print, fill out, and fax — makes this organization effectively inaccessible for online records requests. The hospital earns an F grade, scoring at the bottom of every dimension except compliance, where it narrowly avoids the lowest score only because HIPAA does not explicitly require online form publication.
