# Lankenau Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Forms and Pathways Available

Lankenau Medical Center is part of **Main Line Health**, a regional nonprofit health system in suburban Philadelphia. The facility does not publish its own records request form; instead, it uses a system-wide "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" form managed centrally by Main Line Health. Two nearly identical versions of this form were found at different URLs on mainlinehealth.org — form-1.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0621, June 2021) with 41 fillable fields and interactive buttons, and form-2.pdf (revision MLH900-331.0325, March 2025) as a flat, non-interactive PDF with zero fillable fields. Both are 2-page documents with identical content structure.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The form is a **generic HIPAA authorization** designed to serve all disclosure purposes — release to insurers, attorneys, other providers, and patients alike. It is not a dedicated patient access request form. That said, Main Line Health does include **"Patient personal use"** as an explicit purpose checkbox, which is a positive accommodation. However, the form's framing remains disclosure-oriented: it asks the patient to specify "This information is to be disclosed to: Name of Person or Institution," meaning a patient requesting their own records must somewhat awkwardly write their own name as the disclosure recipient. There is no separate, streamlined pathway for individual access rights under HIPAA § 164.524.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A straightforward web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No bot blocking, authentication, or patient portal login was required. The form is prominently published on the Main Line Health website. The only minor friction is that two versions coexist at different URLs without any clear indication of which is current — a patient could inadvertently download the older fillable version or the newer flat version.

## Form Document Quality

Assessing based on **form-1.pdf** (the fillable version, which provides the better patient experience):

- **Fillable fields**: Yes — 41 interactive fields plus PRINT, SAVE AS, EMAIL, and RESET action buttons. The EMAIL button suggests the form can be completed and submitted entirely digitally. This is genuinely digital-first design.
- **Layout**: Clean and logically organized — facility selection → patient ID → date range → record types → sensitive information → recipient → purpose → delivery → expiration → signatures, with a full instructions page on the reverse.
- **Language**: A mix of plain and legal language. The rights acknowledgment paragraphs are substantive but dense. Instructions on page 2 are clear and well-structured.
- **Instructions**: Thorough. Numbered instructions cover completion requirements, submission methods (fax, email, mail, walk-in), a delivery options matrix by recipient type, fee information, and detailed signing authority guidance for minors, incapacitated patients, and deceased patients under PA law.
- **Delivery options**: Exceptionally strong — six options including encrypted USB, MyChart portal, printed paper (pick-up or mail), fax, and encrypted email/third-party portal. A clear table shows availability by recipient type.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **Prepayment language**: The instructions state "payment will be expected prior to the records being delivered," which could function as a barrier to patient access. Under HIPAA, covered entities should not condition record delivery on prepayment in a way that creates unreasonable barriers.
- **Witness line ambiguity**: A "(Signature of Witness)" field is present but the form does not clarify whether a witness is required, potentially confusing patients completing the form at home.
- **Fee amounts undisclosed**: The form references fees "in accordance with Federal and PA State Law" but does not specify amounts, leaving patients uncertain about costs.
- **No notarization required**: Correct — the form does not impose this unnecessary barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Excellent delivery options** with encrypted electronic formats and a clear availability matrix
- **Fillable PDF** with embedded action buttons (form-1 version)
- **"Patient personal use" checkbox** that normalizes self-access requests
- **Detailed signing authority guidance** reflecting PA-specific law
- **Sensitive information opt-in** with separate checkboxes for HIV, psychiatric, and substance abuse records
- **HIPAA-compliant response timelines** clearly stated (30/60 days with 30-day extension)

## Overall Assessment

Main Line Health provides an above-average records request experience for Lankenau Medical Center patients. The form is easy to find, technically well-executed (in its fillable version), and offers unusually comprehensive delivery options. The primary weakness is the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway — patients must navigate a generic third-party disclosure form and adapt it to their own needs. The prepayment language and undisclosed fee amounts are minor compliance concerns. Overall, this represents a solid **B-grade** experience: a patient can accomplish their goal, but the process wasn't designed with them as the primary audience.
