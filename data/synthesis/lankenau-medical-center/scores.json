      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic disclosure authorization form requires patients to fill in their own name as the 'person or institution' receiving records, and the framing is oriented toward third-party release despite the 'Patient personal use' checkbox."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing that would materially impede a patient — prepayment language is concerning but not a clear violation, response timelines and appeal rights are correctly stated, no notarization required, fee amounts not specified."
