    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Primarily a paper workflow. The primary form (form-2) is an image-only scan with no text layer and no fillable fields; form-1 has a text layer but also zero fillable fields. Neither form provides submission instructions — no fax, email, or portal option is documented."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems. Form-2 has logical organization with clear section headers, scope checkboxes, and a well-written rights section, but the intimidating invalidation warning, dangling footnote references, and image-only format undermine usability."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Patient self-access is an afterthought. While form-2 includes a 'Patient request' checkbox under Purpose, the form is fundamentally structured as a third-party release authorization requiring a recipient's name and address. No HIPAA Right of Access reference, no format/delivery options, no differentiation of the patient self-access workflow."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements or language that may go beyond what the law requires. Form-2 includes proper expiration, revocation, and sensitive info handling. However, the 'failure to provide all information may invalidate' warning could chill patient access, no fees are disclosed, and no submission pathway is provided."

      "summary": "Mayers Memorial provides a below-average records access experience with a mislabeled, scanned authorization form that lacks fillable fields, submission instructions, and any differentiation of patient self-access from third-party release."
