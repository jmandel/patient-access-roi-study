# HopeHealth (Florence, SC) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

HopeHealth is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Florence, South Carolina. The organization has fully outsourced its medical records release process to HealthMark Group, a third-party vendor. No HopeHealth-branded ROI or authorization form exists as a publicly downloadable document. Instead, the organization's medical records page directs patients exclusively to HealthMark's online Request Manager portal.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Two documents were retrieved during the evaluation:

1. **form-1.pdf** — HopeHealth's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP). This is an informational document, not an authorization or request form. It mentions patients' right to access records but provides no actionable mechanism beyond directing them to the Privacy Officer's contact information.

2. **form-2.pdf** — A generic HealthMark Group Medical Records Release Authorization form. This was found on HealthMark's parent company website (hmutx.com), *not* on HopeHealth's website. It is unbranded and could apply to any HealthMark client facility.

The **primary pathway** for a patient is the HealthMark Request Manager online portal, linked from HopeHealth's medical records page at `https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/`. This portal requires email verification to initiate a request.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

HopeHealth does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The generic HealthMark form lists "Patient Request" as one of six purposes alongside Attorney, Insurance, Disability, and Referring Physician — treating patient access as a flavor of general disclosure rather than a distinct legal right under HIPAA § 164.524. The form cites § 164.508 (authorization for disclosure) throughout, which is the wrong legal framework for individual right-of-access requests. It is unknown whether the HealthMark portal differentiates these pathways internally, as the portal could not be accessed without email verification.

## Retrieval Experience

Retrieval was **hard**. Extensive web searches, site-specific searches, Wayback Machine checks, and HTML source inspection failed to locate any HopeHealth-specific authorization form. Search results were complicated by name confusion with Hope Health Ellis County, TX (a different organization). The HealthMark portal is gated behind email verification, making it impossible to evaluate the actual request workflow or any forms within it. The Wayback Machine confirmed this portal-only approach has been consistent since at least 2020.

## Form Document Quality

The generic HealthMark form (form-2.pdf) is a digitally-created single-page PDF but has **no fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite or use annotation tools. It contains approximately 15 data fields and 11 record-type checkboxes. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow (recipient → patient → dates → records → purpose → acknowledgments → signature), but the content is dense, with inline CFR citations and legal language that would challenge many patients. There are no instructions for completion, no statement of patient rights, and no options for how records should be delivered.

## Barriers and Red Flags

No notarization or witness is required. Fees are not disclosed anywhere — neither on the form, the NPP, nor the medical records page. The generic form imposes a fixed 180-day expiration on the authorization, which would not apply to a § 164.524 access request. The NPP contains a notable typo: the Privacy Officer's email is listed as `HIPPA@hope-health.org` (misspelling HIPAA), which could undermine patient confidence and cause email delivery issues.

## Strengths

The decision to outsource to an online portal (HealthMark Group) is conceptually a strength — it provides a digital pathway that avoids requiring patients to download, print, and mail forms. The NPP, while dense, includes concrete patient-friendly examples of permitted uses and addresses substance use disorder protections. The generic form offers granular record-type selection with 11 categories.

## Overall Assessment

HopeHealth's approach is a mixed bag. The online portal represents a modern, potentially patient-friendly pathway, but the organization provides no transparency about what that portal experience entails. There is no downloadable form for patients who prefer a traditional approach, no fee disclosure, and no differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release. The available documentation (NPP and generic form) has quality issues including dense legalese, wrong HIPAA citations, and a notable typo. A patient navigating this system would find their way to the portal with moderate effort but would encounter opacity about the process, fees, and timeline.
