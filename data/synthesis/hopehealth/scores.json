      "score": 4,

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The generic HealthMark form has a logical top-to-bottom flow but uses dense legal language with inline CFR citations, lacks instructions, and provides no delivery format options — adequate but with notable clarity and usability problems."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the HealthMark portal to request records, but the process was not designed for patient self-access as a first-class use case — the generic form treats 'Patient Request' as one of six purposes alongside Attorney and Insurance, and cites the wrong HIPAA section."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: No illegal barriers exist, but applying §164.508 authorization requirements (including a 180-day fixed expiration) to patient right-of-access requests goes beyond what the law requires, and there is no fee or timeline disclosure."
