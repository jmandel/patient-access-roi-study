Slightly below 5 because form is not prominently featured on the homepage itself."
    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds; fax submission available — the PDF is digitally authored with extractable text but has zero fillable fields, requiring patients to print and handwrite. Fax numbers are provided for submission. Not level 2 because fax keeps it from being purely paper; not level 4 because there's no way to fill the form digitally."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity or length issues — eight clearly numbered sections follow a logical progression, granular record selection is excellent, but Section 5 is dense with 17+ line items, and legal boilerplate in Section 7 uses complex sentence structures."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form is a generic 'Authorization to Disclose PHI' oriented toward third-party release, with a 'Self' checkbox and 'Personal' purpose option as accommodations rather than a first-class patient access pathway. No patient rights language or HIPAA § 164.524 reference."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements or language that may go beyond what the law requires — SSN collection is unnecessary for patient access, witness signature line is ambiguous about whether it's mandatory, and fee disclosure is vague ('may charge a fee' with no amounts). Revocation, expiration, and non-conditioning language are properly handled."

      "grade": "C",
      "summary": "Fisher-Titus provides an easily findable and logically organized ROI form with progressive delivery options, but the print-only design, generic third-party authorization framing, SSN collection, and lack of patient rights language prevent it from reaching a patient-centered standard."
