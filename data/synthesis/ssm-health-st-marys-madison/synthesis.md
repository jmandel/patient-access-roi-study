# SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison: Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Madison, a community hospital in Wisconsin's capital and part of the SSM Health system, provides three overlapping PDF authorization forms for medical records requests. None of the three forms are specifically designed for patient self-access; all are generic "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" forms that a patient must adapt for their own use. The most relevant form for a patient at this facility is form-3, a location-specific version pre-filled with the Madison PO Box address and fax numbers for Dean Medical Group and SSM Health Hospitals.

## Available Forms and Pathways

Three forms were found online:

1. **Form-1** (AH-FRM-11595, revised 8/2024): A Wisconsin-wide SSM Health authorization form covering all Wisconsin ministries. Two pages. Most recently updated but not facility-specific.
2. **Form-2** (DPM-2065-035, dated 1/2019): A system-wide SSMHC "Request for Access to/Authorization for Use and Disclosure" form. One page. The only form whose title explicitly includes "Request for Access to" and offers patient access as a named purpose with sub-options (Copy, Inspection, Summary). However, it is outdated (7+ years old), uses the former "SSMHC" branding, and lacks submission instructions entirely.
3. **Form-3** (A9008836, dated 5/2019): A Madison-area-specific authorization form listing St. Mary's Hospital – Madison and five neighboring SSM Health facilities. Two pages. Pre-filled with the Madison PO Box and fax numbers, making it the most actionable form for this facility.

The primary submission pathways are fax (608-294-6294 for Dean Medical Group, 608-270-6815 for SSM Health Hospitals) and postal mail (PO Box 259840, Madison, WI 53725-9840). Phone numbers are provided for inquiries. No online submission portal exists.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

SSM Health does **not** offer a dedicated patient self-access pathway at this facility. All three forms are structured as general HIPAA authorization forms designed primarily for third-party release of information. The best patient-access accommodation is found in form-3's "Personal Use" checkbox (Section 4) and the instruction "(If Release is to Self, State Self)" in Section 3. Form-2 goes further with explicit "For personal access" options and "Type of access requested" (Inspection / Hard Copy / Electronic Copy), but it is outdated and lacks facility-specific submission details. A patient requesting their own records must navigate a form designed for attorneys, insurers, and other third parties, selecting the correct options to indicate self-access.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was rated **easy**. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without bot blocking or JavaScript barriers. The SSM Health website has a "Get My Medical Records" page, and the location-specific form (form-3) has a well-structured URL path (`.../patients-and-visitors/get-medical-records/wisconsin/st-marys-madison-medical-records-request-form.pdf`). However, the existence of three overlapping forms — with different dates, scopes, and content — creates potential confusion. No guidance is provided about which form to use.

## Form Document Quality

Form-3, the most facility-relevant document, is a 2-page PDF with a text layer but **zero fillable fields**. All blanks use underscores and all checkboxes appear as "q" characters, indicating a print-oriented design. A patient must print the form, complete it by hand, and fax or mail it. The layout follows a logical numbered sequence (patient info → recipient → purpose → records scope → format → expiration → signature), and the back page provides thorough patient rights information in an organized bullet-point format. Language is formal but not excessively legalistic. Section 6 offers notably strong delivery format options: MyChart, DVD/CD, Paper, Verbal Disclosure, Fax, and Email — the inclusion of MyChart portal delivery is a genuine bright spot.

Estimated field count for a self-access request is approximately 15 fields (patient demographics, "self" as recipient, purpose selection, record type checkboxes, date range, format, expiration, and signature), which is reasonable.

## Barriers and Concerns

- **No notarization or witness required** — good.
- **Fees for "viewing"**: The back page states SSM Health "may charge a reasonable fee for viewing, copying, postage and preparation of records." HIPAA does not permit charging patients for inspecting their own records, making the "viewing" language a compliance concern.
- **No 30-day timeline commitment** on form-3 (only form-2 mentions a 30-day response time).
- **Sensitive categories default to inclusion**: Section 5a defaults to disclosing mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and developmental disability records unless the patient explicitly excludes them — a design choice that could lead to unintended disclosure.
- **Outdated forms**: Form-3 dates to 2019, while form-1 was revised in 2024, raising questions about whether form-3 is still current.

## Notable Strengths

- **MyChart delivery option**: Offering patient portal delivery on the authorization form is uncommon and genuinely patient-friendly.
- **Multiple electronic delivery formats**: Email and fax are also available as delivery options.
- **Comprehensive patient rights information**: The back page covers right to refuse, inspect, copy, revoke, and includes detailed Wisconsin-specific minor consent rules.
- **Photocopy validity clause**: "A photocopy of this authorization is as valid as the original" removes a friction point.

## Overall Assessment

SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital – Madison earns a **C grade**. The organization makes forms easy to find and provides reasonable delivery format options including MyChart. However, the lack of a dedicated patient access pathway, the complete absence of fillable form fields, the "viewing" fee language that may overreach HIPAA limits, and the use of a generic third-party authorization form for patient self-access all reflect a process that was not designed with the patient requester in mind. The form is usable but not patient-centered.
