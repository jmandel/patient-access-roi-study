# Bayshore Medical Center — Organization-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Bayshore Medical Center, part of the Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) system, routes patients through the system-wide infrastructure for medical records requests. Six documents were retrieved during the search process, but only two are directly relevant for a Bayshore patient requesting their own records: the **Swellbox/Datavant online portal** (primary English pathway) and the **CMR-003 authorization form** (form-6, a 2-page PDF covering all 11 HMH hospitals). A Spanish companion form (CMR-003S, form-3) mirrors the English PDF. Additional documents include an older Medical Group outpatient release form (form-1, dated 2018), two forms from sister facility Pascack Valley (forms 2 and 5), and a records amendment form (form-4).

The primary pathway for English-speaking patients is the Swellbox/Datavant online wizard, linked from the HMH system-wide Medical Records page under "Request Records." Spanish-speaking patients are directed to the CMR-003S PDF download. Notably, the English PDF version of CMR-003 is **not linked** from the Medical Records page — it was found only through web search under an inconsistent URL path (medical-group/patient-forms rather than patients-visitors).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Bayshore does not offer a dedicated patient self-access PDF form. The CMR-003 PDF is a generic HIPAA authorization framed around third-party disclosure: "I authorize Hackensack Meridian Health to release information to: Organization/Recipient." A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name as the "recipient" and select "Personal use" from five purpose options — an awkward workaround. The online portal (Swellbox/Datavant) likely provides a more patient-centric experience as the primary pathway, but the PDF form does not distinguish between individual access and third-party release.

Interestingly, Pascack Valley Medical Center (an HMH sister facility) offers a separate "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-5) with patient-first language and a "Myself" default recipient option. This demonstrates that the HMH system has the concept of a dedicated patient-access form but has not standardized it across all facilities.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the relevant forms required significant effort. The search involved web searches, site-specific navigation, URL pattern guessing, and cross-facility comparison. The Bayshore Medical Center sub-page links to the HMH Medical Records page (2–3 clicks), which prominently features the Swellbox portal but buries the PDF forms. The English CMR-003 was located via web search under the Medical Group directory — a misleading location for a hospital-level form. Retrieval difficulty: **hard**.

## Form Document Quality

The primary PDF form (CMR-003, form-6) is a born-digital 2-page document with a clean text layer but **zero fillable fields**. Patients must print and hand-write all entries. This is particularly notable given that HMH's own amendment form (form-4) has 54 fillable fields — proving the organization has the capability but did not apply it to the ROI form. The layout is logically structured with a clear top-to-bottom flow: patient info → recipient → location → records → purpose → sensitive-record consent → signature → delivery format. Record type granularity is good (11 categories) and delivery format options are comprehensive (paper, encrypted USB/CD, fax, secured email).

Language is a mix of plain and legal. Core instructions are clear, but the minor consent section and legal disclosures use dense, nested phrasing. The form lacks explicit submission instructions — while the contact directory on page 2 lists HIM phone and fax numbers for each campus, the form never tells patients *how* to submit the completed authorization. The fee disclosure is vague: "There may be a fee… Please ask."

## Barriers and Bright Spots

No notarization, in-person submission, or witness requirements exist. Fax submission is available (Bayshore HIM fax: 732-888-7332), providing an adequate electronic pathway. The vague fee disclosure and absent submission instructions are minor barriers.

The standout bright spot is the **EHI Export option** — an explicit offer to provide records in a machine-readable format uploadable to another EHR. This is exceptionally rare on ROI forms and directly supports 21st Century Cures Act interoperability goals (despite the typo "Electric" instead of "Electronic" Health Record). The Spanish companion form, comprehensive contact directory, and granular sensitive-record consent are additional strengths.

## Overall Assessment

Bayshore Medical Center, via HMH, provides a **moderately patient-friendly** records request experience. The Swellbox/Datavant portal offers a digital-first primary pathway, and the PDF form — while non-fillable and oriented toward third-party release — includes progressive features like EHI Export and multilingual availability. The main weaknesses are the difficult findability of the English PDF, the generic authorization framing that doesn't clearly serve patient self-access, and the lack of fillable fields on a form that could easily support them. Grade: **B**.
