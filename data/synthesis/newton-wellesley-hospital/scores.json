    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital with one gap — the form has 78 fillable fields enabling full on-screen completion, but submission requires fax or mail (no online form submission), though records can be delivered electronically."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — five clearly lettered sections (A-E) with logical flow and clean layout, but Section D contains dense regulatory language and the 'MUST specify dates' instruction adds complexity."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form is a generic third-party authorization that accommodates patient self-access via 'Personal' purpose checkbox and self-mailing option, but doesn't distinguish patient access rights or reference Right of Access."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization required, implicit fee exemption for patient access, standard expiration and revocation provisions, though the 'MUST specify dates' requirement and outside records carve-out go slightly beyond what HIPAA requires."

      "summary": "Newton-Wellesley Hospital provides a technically well-executed, fillable authorization form through its MGB parent system that is easy to find and digitally usable, but lacks a dedicated patient self-access pathway, funneling all requestors through a generic third-party release form."
