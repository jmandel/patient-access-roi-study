    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Primarily a paper workflow — the PDF has zero fillable fields (print and handwrite only), and while fax is stated as accepted, no fax number is provided on the form itself, leaving the patient to find submission details from a separate document."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems — the single-page format and numbered structure are good, but the ambiguous item 2 field, bottom-of-page-only required-field legend, mixed plain/legal language, and absence of an 'All Records' option create friction."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic third-party release form requires patients to figure out how to use it for self-access, with no mention of patient rights or individual access under HIPAA § 164.524."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — witness signatures are unnecessary for patient self-access, bundled sensitive-info consent removes patient control, and no fee disclosure leaves cost obligations opaque."
