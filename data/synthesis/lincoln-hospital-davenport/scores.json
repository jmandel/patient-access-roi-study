      "score": 3,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but the form wasn't designed for them — the third-party release structure dominates page 1 and patients must figure out which parts apply to self-access, despite page 2's access request language."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Strong compliance fundamentals (no-conditions statement, revocation rights, response time, psychotherapy notes exclusion) are undermined by a fee schedule that likely exceeds HIPAA cost-based limits for patient access and a photo ID attachment requirement."
