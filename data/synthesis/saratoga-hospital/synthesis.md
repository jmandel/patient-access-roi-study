# Saratoga Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Saratoga Hospital is a nonprofit community hospital in Saratoga Springs, NY, now part of the **Albany Med Health System (AMHS)**. Its original website (saratogahospital.org) redirects to albanymed.org/saratoga/. Two authorization forms were found: an older Saratoga Hospital–specific form (form-1.pdf, dated 2020) and the current system-wide AMHS form (form-2.pdf, dated November 2024). The system-wide form is the one actively linked from the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page and is the primary form a patient would encounter today.

## Access Pathway: Third-Party Release, Not Patient Access

Neither form offers a dedicated patient self-access pathway. Both are titled "Authorization to Disclose Protected Health Information" and are structured as third-party release authorizations. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name and address in the "Release Information To" / "Disclose To" field and select a purpose — an awkward workaround for what should be a straightforward right-of-access request. There is no checkbox, section, or simplified flow for "I want my own records." Neither form references HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or explains patient access rights beyond the right to revoke authorization.

The system-wide form (form-2) does include a sidebar callout to **MyChart** (mychart.albanymed.org), the AMHS patient portal, as an alternative pathway. This is a meaningful digital option, though the form does not clarify what records are accessible through MyChart or whether it satisfies a full records request.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was **easy**. A general web search returned direct links, and the AMHS "Requesting Medical Records" page is accessible without login or bot blocking. The only complexity is the redirect from the Saratoga Hospital domain to Albany Med, which could momentarily confuse a patient searching by the old hospital name. Both PDFs downloaded without difficulty.

## Form Document Quality (Primary: form-2.pdf)

The system-wide form is a strong technical document. It is a digitally constructed PDF (not a scan) with **65 fillable fields** — an unusually high count indicating comprehensive interactive coverage. Patients can complete every field on-screen without printing. The form spans 2 pages with a logical layout: patient demographics → record type selection → facility selection → sensitive information initials → recipient details → delivery method (page 1), then legal disclosures and signatures (page 2).

Record type options are granular (13 categories plus "Other"), and the form includes an "Entire Record" checkbox — an option absent from the older form-1. Delivery methods include email, fax, mail (with CD/USB options), and in-person pick-up. The multi-facility checkboxes let patients specify which AMHS hospital(s) to release from.

The main weakness is page 2: a dense wall of legal text covering revocation rights, HIV/AIDS protections, re-disclosure warnings, and 42 CFR Part 2 — all in small print with no headings, bullets, or visual hierarchy. The language is written at a college reading level. The footer on both pages contains a typo ("Dislcose" instead of "Disclose").

## Barriers

**Fee concern**: Both forms state a **$0.75/page copy fee** (phrased as "$0.75 cents per page" — a formatting error). The fee is waived for physician-to-physician transfers but not explicitly waived for patient self-access. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, per-page fees are generally impermissible; only reasonable cost-based fees are allowed. This is the most significant compliance concern.

**No witness required**: The newer system-wide form (form-2) removed the witness signature line that appeared on the legacy form-1 — a clear improvement.

**No notarization or in-person requirement**: Patients can submit by fax, email, or mail, satisfying the electronic submission baseline.

**No response time stated**: Neither form commits to a turnaround timeline.

## Notable Strengths

- **65 fillable fields** on the primary form — one of the most digitally complete ROI forms encountered
- **MyChart portal alternative** mentioned directly on the form
- **Granular record type and sensitive-information controls** with separate initials for HIV, mental health, substance abuse, and genetic testing
- **Multi-facility coverage** — a single form for all four AMHS hospitals reduces confusion

## Overall Assessment

Saratoga Hospital, via the Albany Med Health System, provides a technically polished and easily findable authorization form with excellent fillable-field coverage and a MyChart alternative. However, the experience is undermined by the complete absence of a dedicated patient self-access pathway: patients must navigate a third-party release framework to exercise their individual access rights. The $0.75/page fee applied without distinguishing patient access from third-party release is a compliance concern. The form is a solid B-level document in terms of technical quality, but the lack of patient-centeredness and fee ambiguity hold back the overall score.
