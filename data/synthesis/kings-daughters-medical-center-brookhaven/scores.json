      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: No downloadable ROI form exists to directly evaluate; the Datavant wizard is a professional SaaS platform likely adequate in design, but content quality could not be independently verified. The NPP is well-designed but is not the records request form."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the Datavant wizard to request records, but the process does not differentiate patient self-access from third-party release; the fee structure and generic approach indicate the pathway was not designed specifically for individual access rights under HIPAA."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The per-page fee model ($6.50 + $0.12/page) may go beyond HIPAA's reasonable cost-based fee standard for patient access, as OCR has specifically criticized per-page charges in Right of Access enforcement actions; no notarization or in-person barriers identified."

      "grade": "B",
      "summary": "KDMC's fully digital Datavant portal is a strong technical advantage for a small community hospital, but the lack of differentiation between patient self-access and third-party release, combined with a potentially excessive per-page fee structure, prevents a higher score."
