# King's Daughters Medical Center (Brookhaven, MS) — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

King's Daughters Medical Center (KDMC) in Brookhaven, MS presents an unusual case: the organization does not publish any downloadable Release of Information (ROI) or authorization form on its website. An exhaustive search of kdmc.org found only six PDFs on the entire domain, none of which are patient-facing ROI forms. The two documents retrieved for this study — a Joint Notice of Privacy Practices (form-1.pdf) and an Employer Occupational Health Authorization Form (form-2.pdf) — are entirely irrelevant to the patient self-access use case.

Instead, KDMC has fully outsourced medical records requests to **Datavant (formerly Swellbox)**, a third-party vendor, via an online wizard at `https://www.swellbox.com/kings-daughters-mc-wizard.html`. The website's "Online Medical Record Request" page in the Patients & Visitors section redirects to this wizard. A patient portal (myportal.kdmc.org) also exists but was not evaluated as a records request pathway. Phone contact is available through both Datavant customer service (601-835-9276) and the Health Information Records department (601-835-9282).

## Access Pathway Differentiation

KDMC does **not** clearly differentiate between patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access and third-party release of information. The Datavant wizard is a general-purpose records request platform — it handles all request types through the same interface. There is no dedicated patient access form, no separate pathway labeled for individual access rights, and the fee structure ($6.50 flat fee + $0.12 per page) follows a per-page model typically associated with third-party release rather than cost-based patient access fees. The NPP tells patients they can get copies of their records but only says "Ask us how to do this" — offering no concrete steps, no link to the online wizard, and no phone number for HIM.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding records request information for KDMC was rated **Hard**. The primary challenge was that no downloadable ROI form exists anywhere on the website — the process is entirely online through a third-party vendor. Search was further complicated by name confusion with King's Daughters Health System in Ashland, KY, an entirely separate organization whose forms appeared in search results. No bot blocking was encountered and no browser fallback was needed. The difficulty was structural, not technical.

## Form Document Quality

Since no ROI form exists as a downloadable document, traditional form quality metrics (fillable fields, layout, typography) cannot be directly assessed. The Datavant/Swellbox online wizard replaces the traditional PDF form experience with a web-based workflow. As a professional SaaS platform purpose-built for medical records requests, the wizard likely provides adequate usability, but its specific content design could not be independently evaluated.

The NPP (form-1.pdf) — while not an ROI form — is notably well-crafted: a single-page, plain-language document with clear bullet points, section headers, and patient-friendly examples. It demonstrates that KDMC is capable of producing accessible patient-facing documents.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most significant concern is the **fee structure**. The $6.50 flat fee plus $0.12 per page follows a per-page model that HHS Office for Civil Rights has specifically targeted in Right of Access enforcement actions. HIPAA limits patient access fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts, and per-page charges have been deemed inappropriate for patient access in multiple OCR settlements. It is unclear whether KDMC or Datavant distinguishes patient self-access (with fee limitations) from third-party requests.

No notarization or witness requirements were identified. Photo ID is required for in-person pickup, which is standard identity verification. The complete absence of a downloadable form means patients without reliable internet access have no self-service path visible on the website — they would need to call the HIM department.

## Notable Strengths

- **Fully digital submission pathway**: For a small community hospital, offering an online records request process is a meaningful positive — many peer institutions still require printed, faxed, or mailed forms.
- **Professional platform**: Datavant/Swellbox is a purpose-built records management platform, likely providing a more consistent and functional experience than many ad hoc PDF forms.
- **Well-crafted NPP**: The single-page, plain-language Notice of Privacy Practices demonstrates good document design capabilities.

## Overall Assessment

KDMC earns a **B grade (3.50)** driven primarily by its fully digital submission pathway through Datavant — a significant technical advantage over paper-based peers. However, the organization falls short on patient-centeredness by failing to differentiate patient self-access from third-party release, and the per-page fee model raises compliance concerns. The complete absence of a downloadable ROI form, while a side effect of the online-first approach, means there is no fallback for patients who need or prefer paper. For a small independent community hospital in the South, the online pathway is commendable, but the lack of attention to HIPAA Right of Access distinctions prevents a higher score.
