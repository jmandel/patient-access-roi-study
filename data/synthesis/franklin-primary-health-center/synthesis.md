# Franklin Primary Health Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Franklin Primary Health Center is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Mobile, Alabama. Despite an exhaustive search — including five targeted Google queries, full website navigation, sitemap analysis, URL guessing across 14 filename patterns, and Wayback Machine archival review — **no dedicated Release of Information or medical records request form was found online**. The organization does not publish any mechanism for patients to initiate a records request from their website.

## Available Documents

Three documents were retrieved, none of which is an ROI form:

1. **New Patient Registration Packet** (form-1, 8 pages): A comprehensive intake packet with demographics, insurance, sliding fee scale, privacy acknowledgment, patient questionnaire, satisfaction survey, and bill of rights. Contains a narrow "Assignment and Release" clause authorizing FPHC to release information to insurers for billing — not a general records release.
2. **Notice of Privacy Practices** (form-2, 6 pages): A well-written HIPAA NPP following the HHS model template. Describes the right to "get a copy of your paper or electronic medical record" and states a 30-day response window with cost-based fees, but provides no actionable mechanism — directing patients to "Ask us how to do this."
3. **Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities** (form-3, 1 page): Lists the right "to review and have copies of your medical records" but offers no instructions, contact information, or process for exercising it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Franklin Primary Health Center **does not differentiate** between patient self-access and third-party release because it provides no records request pathway of any kind online. The only ROI-adjacent content is the billing-specific "Assignment and Release" clause in the intake packet, which authorizes release to insurance payers — the opposite of patient-directed access. A patient seeking their own records must call (251) 432-4117 or visit in person.

The organization does operate an EPIC/MyChart patient portal through OCHIN (https://mychart.ochin.org/MyChartFPHC/), which could potentially offer a records access pathway. However, the main website does not reference this portal in the context of medical records requests, and patients would need to already be enrolled to discover this option.

## Retrieval Experience

The search was exhaustive and fruitless for ROI purposes. The website's "For Patients" section has no medical records page. The WordPress sitemap contains no ROI-related URLs. The Wayback Machine confirms no ROI form has ever been published on this domain. Finding the NPP and intake packet required direct PDF link scanning. A real patient attempting this search would likely give up and call the office — which appears to be the intended workflow.

## Form Document Quality

Since no ROI form exists, form quality assessment applies only to the related informational documents. The NPP (form-2) is the strongest document: written in plain, patient-friendly language with clear section headers, logical organization, and consistent formatting. The intake packet (form-1) has 241 fillable fields and is digitally completable, but suffers from three spelling errors ("EXPIRARTION," "REPSONSIBILITIES," "REPONSIBLE"), dense all-caps legalese in the release clause, and bundled consent for treatment, financial responsibility, and billing release in a single signature block.

## Barriers

- **No online form**: The most fundamental barrier — patients cannot begin a records request online.
- **No submission pathway documented**: No fax number, email address, or mailing address is provided for records requests (the Privacy Officer contact on the NPP is framed for complaints, not access requests).
- **In-person or phone required**: The practical effect is that patients must contact the facility directly.
- **Fees ambiguous**: The NPP mentions "reasonable, cost-based fee" without specifying amounts.

## Bright Spots

- The NPP includes a clear substance abuse treatment protection statement, relevant for the FQHC population.
- The NPP is written in genuinely plain language following the HHS model template.
- The intake packet's 241 fillable fields show investment in digital-first document design (for intake, at least).
- OCHIN/MyChart portal availability could provide an alternative pathway for enrolled patients.

## Overall Assessment

Franklin Primary Health Center earns a failing grade for online patient records access. While the organization demonstrates competence in patient-facing communication (the NPP is well-written) and digital document design (fillable intake forms), it provides no pathway whatsoever for patients to request their own medical records online. The complete absence of an ROI form — not a poorly designed one, but literally none — means a patient's HIPAA Right of Access is practically inaccessible from the website. This represents a significant gap for an FQHC, whose patient population may face particular challenges with in-person visits or phone-based processes.
