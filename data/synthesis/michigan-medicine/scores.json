    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Patient self-access is clearly accommodated via the dedicated 'Myself' option (item 2) with tailored delivery methods, and the free portal pathway is prominently promoted, even though the form serves multiple purposes."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Voluntariness, revocation rights, and fees are transparently disclosed; minor ambiguity in prepayment language that could be read to apply to patient self-requests, and patient electronic delivery fee ($6.89) is close to but not clearly justified under HIPAA cost-based limits."
