    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form includes a 'Me' checkbox but patients must navigate third-party release fields, a purpose-of-release field, and authorization framing rather than access-right framing."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — no fee disclosure despite HIPAA requirements, purpose-of-release field without opt-out clarification for self-requests, and no explicit Right of Access framing, though voluntariness and revocation language are solid."
