# ENT & Allergy Associates, LLP — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

ENT & Allergy Associates is a large for-profit physician practice with 80+ offices across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Despite its size, the organization provides one of the poorest records-request experiences in this study. The sole ROI form is a 17-year-old Microsoft Word document buried on the website with no visible link, no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no pathway designed for patients requesting their own records.

## Forms & Pathways

Two documents were retrieved:

1. **form-1.pdf** (the ROI form): "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA" — a 2-page generic third-party release authorization. Originally a `.doc` file created in 2009, converted to PDF for this study. This is the only records-release mechanism available.
2. **form-2.pdf** (not an ROI form): "Patient Acknowledgment Form – Allergy Form Completion Fee" — a $25 fee acknowledgment for physician form completion (school/activity clearance). Found in the footer under the misleading label "Allergy Authorization Form."

There is no patient portal, no online request wizard, and no dedicated patient access form. The only pathway is downloading a Word document and figuring out independently how to submit it.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The organization does **not** differentiate patient self-access from third-party release. Form-1 is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for releasing records to a named third party. A patient requesting their own records must list themselves as the recipient in Item 8 ("Name and address of person(s) or category of person to whom this information will be sent"), which is unintuitive and not explained anywhere. The form contains no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), no patient rights statement specific to individual access, and no language acknowledging that a patient may simply want to inspect or obtain copies of their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding this form was exceptionally difficult. The website has no "Patient Forms," "Medical Records," or "Request Your Records" section. The FAQ mentions medical records only in the context of retention policies. The footer link labeled "Allergy Authorization Form" leads to the fee acknowledgment (form-2), not the ROI form. The actual ROI form exists at an orphaned URL (`/documents/content/enta_arphi_form.doc`) not linked from any navigable page — it was only discoverable through a targeted `filetype:doc` web search. A patient browsing the website would have no path to this form.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a Word `.doc` file with zero fillable fields, requiring patients to either print and handwrite or type into the Word template. The layout uses a numbered list but lacks visual hierarchy — no section headers, minimal bold, and no section dividers. Language is moderately dense legalese with constructions like "except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization." Item 6 is entirely in ALL-CAPS and contains a typo ("THEN" instead of "THE"). The form collects approximately 12–15 pieces of information, including the patient's Social Security Number — an unnecessary data collection point that creates a privacy risk.

## Barriers & Red Flags

- **No submission instructions whatsoever.** The form provides no address, fax number, email, or portal link. A patient who manages to find and complete it has no guidance on how to return it.
- **SSN requested.** Unnecessary for identity verification in records requests and a data security risk.
- **Severely outdated.** Last modified January 2009 — predates the HITECH Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the ONC Information Blocking Rule.
- **Confusing Item 6.** The ALL-CAPS restriction on discussing health information could be read to limit the provider's ability to discuss records even with the patient themselves.

## Bright Spots

- **Proper handling of sensitive categories.** The form correctly requires separate initialing for HIV, substance abuse, and mental health records, with anti-redisclosure language and civil rights contact information per NY/NJ state law.
- **Anti-conditioning statement.** Item 4 clearly states treatment and benefits will not be conditioned on signing the authorization.

## Overall Assessment

ENT & Allergy Associates presents a deeply patient-unfriendly records request experience. The combination of an effectively unfindable form, an outdated Word document format, zero fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no patient-access-specific pathway means that a patient attempting to request their records online would face barriers at every step. For a practice of this size and market presence, this represents a significant gap in patient-centered service. **Grade: D.**
