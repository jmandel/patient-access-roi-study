# St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, a Dignity Health (CommonSpirit Health) facility in Phoenix, AZ, offers a notably differentiated approach to medical records access. The organization maintains separate forms for patient self-access (form-2.pdf) and third-party release (form-3.pdf), with its medical records webpage clearly distinguishing between the two pathways. This separation is a meaningful patient-centeredness achievement that many organizations fail to provide.

## Forms and Pathways

Three documents were retrieved:

- **form-2.pdf** (primary): "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" (X-MR-4869, dated 02/22) — a 5-page dedicated patient access form linked from the St. Joseph's medical records page as the "request for yourself" option. This is the most relevant form for a patient seeking their own records.
- **form-3.pdf**: A 2-page third-party authorization form (X-MR-4862, dated 03/13) — an image-only scan used for releasing records to physicians or other parties.
- **form-1.pdf**: A general Arizona Dignity Health authorization form found via web search but not linked from the St. Joseph's page. It references Mercy Gilbert Medical Center and appears to be from a different facility.

The medical records page also references an online Patient Center/Patient Portal as an alternative access channel (Section D of form-2).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form required navigating approximately 4–5 clicks through the Dignity Health website (Home → Arizona → St. Joseph's → Patients and Visitors → For Patients → Medical Records). The path is logical and well-structured, though it requires traversing the multi-facility health system hierarchy. The medical records page clearly separates patient self-request from third-party authorization — a helpful distinction that reduces confusion at the point of access.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

St. Joseph's stands out for maintaining a **dedicated patient access form** that is clearly distinct from its third-party release authorization. Form-2 is explicitly titled "Patient's Request for Access to Protected Health Information" and covers only patient self-access, while form-3 handles third-party disclosures. This organizational separation reflects genuine awareness of the difference between HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524) and authorization for disclosure (§ 164.508).

However, the execution has some issues. The form's processing language states the hospital will "contact you with either denial or acceptance of the request" — framing patient access as discretionary rather than as a right that must be fulfilled within 30 days. Additionally, the employee verification block on page 4 (fields for "ID Presented" and staff verification) implies in-person presentation may be expected, even though email and fax submission are explicitly offered.

## Form Document Quality

Form-2 is digitally typeset with a clean text layer but contains **zero fillable form fields**, requiring patients to print and complete it by hand. The form is organized into five lettered sections (A through E) with a logical progression: access type → delivery format → record types → patient portal → directing records to others. This structure is clear and well-conceived.

The form offers unusually comprehensive delivery options: USB drive, CD, secure email, unsecured email, and paper. Submission can be done via email (DignityHealth-AZ-ROI@DignityHealth.org) or fax (two numbers provided), eliminating the need for physical visits. Record type granularity is excellent, with 14+ specific categories plus a "Complete Health Record" option.

The main content design weaknesses are the routing complexity on page 1 — six different email addresses and three fax numbers for different departments, requiring patients to determine which contact handles their request — and the multi-state sensitive records sections (Arizona, California, and Nevada), which add confusion for patients at an Arizona facility. At 5 pages (4 patient-facing plus a facility-only denial page), the form is moderately long but justified by the breadth of options.

## Barriers and Compliance

No notarization or witness signatures are required. Submission is available via email and fax, so no in-person visit is necessary. Fees are mentioned ("Fees may apply. See attached price list") but the referenced price list is not included in the PDF, leaving patients unable to assess costs upfront. No specific response time or turnaround commitment is stated. A Spanish version of the form is available, which is a positive accessibility feature for the Phoenix market.

## Overall Assessment

St. Joseph's earns credit for the structural decision to maintain a dedicated patient access form — a practice that most organizations do not follow. The form offers genuine patient choice in record types and delivery formats. However, the lack of fillable fields, complex routing instructions, discretionary "acceptance" language, and missing fee schedule prevent the experience from reaching its potential. The result is an organization that has the right framework but falls short in execution, landing at a **C grade (3.40)** that reflects adequate but improvable service to patients requesting their own records.
