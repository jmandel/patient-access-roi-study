      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Well-organized lettered sections (A–E) with logical flow, but notable clarity problems including complex routing (6 email addresses, 3 fax numbers) and confusing multi-state sensitive records sections on a facility-specific form."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: No notarization or in-person requirements, but the 'acceptance or denial' language goes beyond what HIPAA requires for patient access, the fee schedule is referenced but not included, and no response timeframe is stated."
