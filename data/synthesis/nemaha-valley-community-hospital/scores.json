    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Image-only scan with zero fillable fields and no text layer; patient must print, handwrite all fields, and contact the hospital to determine submission method — a primarily paper workflow."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Logical field sequence and reasonably clear legal language, but undermined by dense paragraph text without visual breaks, staff-facing cost worksheet included as page 2, pagination errors, and dated typewriter-style formatting."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the form by listing themselves as recipient, but the form was not designed for patient self-access — it lacks right-of-access language, requires naming a recipient and purpose as if for third-party disclosure, and provides no guidance for patients requesting their own records."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Fees are reasonable and no notarization required, but SSN collection goes beyond what is legally necessary, no right-of-access language is included, and the lack of submission instructions creates an implicit barrier that may delay patient requests."

      "grade": "C",
      "summary": "Nemaha Valley Community Hospital's records request process is easy to find but hampered by a decade-old image-only scan form, a generic third-party authorization design with no patient access differentiation, an unnecessary SSN field, and missing submission instructions."
