# Nemaha Valley Community Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital, an independent nonprofit critical access hospital in Seneca, Kansas, provides two documents on its Resources page: an "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a Notice of Privacy Practices (form-2.pdf). The authorization form is the only mechanism available for patients to request their records. A Spanish-language version of the authorization form is also linked from the same page but was not separately downloaded for evaluation.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

The hospital does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release. The authorization form is a generic HIPAA authorization designed for disclosures to named third parties — a patient wanting their own records must list themselves as the recipient and navigate fields (purpose, recipient address) that assume a third-party disclosure scenario. There is no mention of HIPAA § 164.524, no "right of access" language, and no separate pathway for individual access requests. The NPP, by contrast, does describe the right to inspect and obtain copies and even commits to providing records in electronic format upon request — but this information lives in a 12-page compliance document, not in the actual request form.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The hospital's Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) is accessible within two clicks from the homepage, and a site-scoped web search surfaced the link quickly. The page labels the form clearly as "Authorization for Release of Health Information." No bot blocking or access restrictions were encountered. General `filetype:pdf` searches did not return direct results, but this is a minor issue given how easily the form was found through site navigation.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a significant weakness. It is an **image-only scan** — a photocopy of a paper form scanned by a Savin copier in 2016, with zero extractable text, zero fillable fields, and no accessibility metadata. The revision date is January 2014, making it over a decade old. The form must be printed and filled out entirely by hand.

The layout is functional but dated, using a typewriter-style font with hand-drawn lines. Page 1 follows a logical sequence: patient identification, recipient designation, purpose, a 14-item record-type checklist, treatment date range, legal disclosures, and signature block. Page 2 is an internal cost-calculation worksheet that probably should not have been included in the patient-facing download — it shows per-page copy rates, labor charges, and staff-use fields for tracking releases. Both pages are erroneously labeled "Page 2 of 2."

The legal language is reasonably clear for a healthcare authorization form, but it is presented as dense paragraph text with no bold headings or visual breaks between disclosure sections.

## Barriers and Concerns

The most notable red flag is the **Social Security Number field**, which is prominently placed alongside name, birthdate, and MRN. SSN collection is unnecessary for medical records release and creates identity theft risk — especially concerning for a form that must be physically handled (printed, mailed, or hand-delivered).

The form provides **no submission instructions** — no mailing address for the records department, no fax number, and no mention of email or portal submission. A patient would need to call the hospital to learn how to submit the completed form. The cost worksheet on page 2 references pick-up, mail, and fax as record delivery methods, suggesting fax capability exists, but no fax number is provided on the form itself.

Fees are very reasonable: $0.03 per page for copies, with a $3.90 per 15-minute labor charge. The per-page rate is well within HIPAA limits. The $10 charges for CDs and USB drives are dated but not egregious.

## Notable Strengths

Despite its weaknesses, the hospital has several bright spots. The availability of a **Spanish-language authorization form** is notable for a small rural hospital in Kansas. The **14-item record-type checklist** gives patients granular control over what is released. The **NPP is excellent** — recently updated (February 2026), it names a specific Privacy Officer with direct phone and email, commits to electronic format delivery, includes HIE participation transparency, and offers multilingual nondiscrimination taglines in 15+ languages. The contrast between the polished, current NPP and the decade-old scanned authorization form is striking.

## Overall Assessment

Nemaha Valley Community Hospital earns a **C grade**. The form is easy to find and fees are fair, but the core patient experience is undermined by an image-only scan that forces a fully paper-based workflow, a generic third-party authorization form with no patient access differentiation, an SSN field that creates unnecessary risk, and a complete absence of submission instructions. The hospital clearly has the capacity to produce quality digital documents (as evidenced by the NPP), but has not applied that capability to its records request process.
