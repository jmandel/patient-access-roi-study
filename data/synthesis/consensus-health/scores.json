    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,

      "score": 2,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Patient self-access is an afterthought — the only form found is structured as a third-party release authorization with no accommodation for patients requesting their own records, and no dedicated patient access pathway exists."

      "score": 3,
