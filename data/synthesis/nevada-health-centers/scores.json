    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3 (adequate but has notable problems): the layout is logically organized and concise at one page, but the missing 'All Records' option, ambiguous 'To/From' direction, and compressed bilingual format create clarity issues a patient would struggle with."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3 (a patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them): the generic release form can accommodate patient self-access via the 'Personal' reason and 'To' direction, but it lacks any dedicated patient access language, rights information, or acknowledgment of HIPAA § 164.524."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3 (some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires): the form asks for a reason for request (not required by HIPAA for patient access), has no patient rights disclosure, no fee transparency, and the ambiguous witness field may create a perceived barrier."
