# El Rio Health — Organizational Synthesis

## Overview

El Rio Health is an independent, nonprofit FQHC in Tucson, Arizona. Despite extensive searching — including web searches, site navigation, sitemap analysis, WordPress directory probing, MyChart portal review, and Wayback Machine checks — **no downloadable Release of Information (ROI) or patient access request form was found** on their public website. The only patient-facing document retrieved was a 16-page HIPAA compliance booklet, which describes the right to access records but provides no mechanism to exercise it.

## Available Pathways

El Rio Health appears to route patients through two channels for records access:

1. **MyChart patient portal** (Epic) — for online viewing and downloading of records. This requires an existing patient account and is not a general-purpose records request mechanism.
2. **Phone or in-person contact** — the compliance booklet directs patients to call (520) 670-3909 or visit a clinic location. The repeated instruction is "Ask us how to do this," with no further detail.

No PDF form, online request wizard, or third-party portal (e.g., Swellbox/Datavant) was identified. The compliance booklet's chronic pain section references "full mutual releases of information," confirming the organization uses ROI forms internally — they simply are not published for patient self-service.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

El Rio Health does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release in any publicly visible way. There is no dedicated patient access form, no distinct pathway labeled for individual record requests, and no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access as a separate process from authorization for third-party release. The compliance booklet treats the right to access records as one item in a long list of privacy practices, without actionable next steps.

## Retrieval Experience

The retrieval difficulty was rated **hard/impossible**. The website has no "Medical Records," "Health Information Management," or "Forms" page. The Patient Information page offers only booklets and notices — no actionable forms. All search strategies (Google queries with filetype:pdf, site-specific searches, sitemap crawling, upload directory probing) returned nothing. No bot-blocking or browser fallback issues were encountered; the forms simply do not exist online.

## Form Document Quality

Since no ROI form was found, form quality assessment is limited to the compliance booklet (form-1.pdf), which is **not** a records request form. That said:

- **Format:** Digitally produced PDF with full text layer, but zero fillable fields — even the signature/acknowledgment page requires printing.
- **Layout:** Well-organized with clear section headers (Your Rights, Your Choices, Our Uses & Disclosures). Follows the HHS model notice format.
- **Language:** Plain, accessible English. The filename convention (`compliance-booklet-eng.pdf`) implies a Spanish version may exist, though it was not confirmed.
- **Instructions for records access:** Minimal. The booklet states records will be provided "usually within 30 days" at a "reasonable, cost-based fee" but offers no specific process, form, or dedicated contact for records requests.

## Barriers

- **No form available online** — the most significant barrier. Patients must call during business hours or visit in person just to learn how to request their records.
- **No electronic submission pathway** for a formal records request (MyChart allows viewing existing records but is not a general records request mechanism).
- **No fee specifics** — mentions "reasonable, cost-based fee" without amounts.
- **No notarization or witness requirements** observed (though no form exists to assess).

## Notable Strengths

- **Plain-language HIPAA notice** following the HHS model format — genuinely readable.
- **Comprehensive patient rights section** covering dignity, comfort, and education.
- **Likely bilingual materials** given the filename convention and Tucson demographics.
- **MyChart portal availability** provides at least some digital access for established patients.

## Overall Assessment

El Rio Health falls significantly short in serving a patient trying to request their own health records online. While the organization provides a well-written HIPAA notice and a MyChart portal for established patients, the absence of any publicly available records request form — combined with the vague "ask us how" instructions — forces patients into an opaque, phone-only process. For an FQHC serving a population that may face transportation and scheduling barriers, this is a meaningful gap. The organization clearly has internal ROI processes but has not made them patient-facing, resulting in a process that is neither transparent nor self-service.
