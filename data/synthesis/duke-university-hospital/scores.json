      "score": 3,

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities — vague fee disclosure ('may charge a fee' without amounts), SSN collection not required by HIPAA, and sensitive-information opt-in may exceed what's needed for patient access — but nothing that would materially impede a patient."
