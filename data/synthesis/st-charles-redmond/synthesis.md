# St. Charles Redmond — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

St. Charles Redmond is part of the St. Charles Health System, a nonprofit regional system operating four hospitals across Central Oregon (Bend, Redmond, Madras, Prineville). The system uses a single, unified ROI authorization form across all locations — there is no Redmond-specific form. Four PDF documents were retrieved: a legacy 2016 non-fillable version (form-1), a superseded 2022 fillable version (form-2), the current 2025 English fillable version (form-3), and the current 2025 Spanish fillable version (form-4). The primary form for assessment is **form-3.pdf**, the current English authorization form linked from the website.

## Access Pathway: Generic Authorization, Not Patient-Specific

St. Charles does **not** offer a dedicated patient access request form. All records requests — whether a patient seeking their own records or a third party requesting disclosure — are routed through the same "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information" form. A patient requesting their own records checks "Personal" under the purpose field, but the form's From/To structure, designed to handle bidirectional provider-to-provider transfers, is unintuitive for simple self-access. There is no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524), and the form uses an authorization framework (§ 164.508) rather than an access-request framework — a meaningful distinction that affects fee limits and processing timelines.

The website's release-of-information page does distinguish between self-requests and third-party requests in its instructions, and notes that patients can alternatively use **MyChart** for records from April 7, 2018 onward. This patient portal pathway offers a fully digital alternative, though it is limited to records after the system's EHR transition date.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was straightforward. The first web search immediately surfaced the St. Charles ROI page, which is clearly linked under the Patients section. Both English and Spanish PDF links are prominently displayed. No bot blocking or browser fallback was needed. The only minor issue was that legacy form URLs remain accessible on the server, meaning a search engine could direct patients to an outdated version.

## Form Document Quality

The current form (form-3.pdf) is a well-constructed 2-page fillable PDF with **65 interactive fields** covering all data-entry points. This is a genuinely usable digital document — patients can type their responses on-screen. The form uses a numbered section system (1–10) with matching instructions at the bottom of each page, a thoughtful design pattern. Record-type options are granular, with parenthetical descriptions explaining what each category includes. Plain-language parentheticals gloss legal concepts (e.g., "revoke (take back or change my mind about)").

However, the layout is dense, and the dual From/To sections (3 and 4) have **identical instruction text**, creating confusion about which section applies to whom. The CORA radiology contact information adds operational clutter. The form collects approximately 15–20 patient-facing fields (demographics, purpose, locations, record types, date range, sensitive-records initials, format/delivery, and signature).

## Barriers

The most significant barrier is the **wet-ink signature requirement** — the form explicitly states "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED," preventing electronic signatures and forcing patients to print the form after filling it digitally. The submission pathway then requires faxing (HIM fax number is listed in the footer: 541-706-6352) or mailing to the Bend HIM office. Fax submission is available, satisfying the electronic submission threshold, but the print-sign-fax workflow is cumbersome.

Fees are mentioned twice ("Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations") but never quantified, leaving patients unable to estimate costs. No fee schedule is referenced. The form does not distinguish between patient-access fees (subject to HIPAA's cost-based limits) and third-party release fees.

No notarization is required. A photo ID check appears in the office-use section but is not presented as a patient-facing barrier.

## Notable Strengths

- **Bilingual availability**: Full Spanish translation (form-4) with 65 fillable fields — genuinely uncommon and meaningful for Central Oregon's community.
- **Iterative improvement**: The progression from flat PDF (2016) to 64-field fillable (2022) to 65-field fillable (2025) shows active form maintenance.
- **System-wide form with location checkboxes**: Simplifies multi-location requests within the St. Charles system.
- **MyChart alternative**: Provides a fully digital pathway for post-2018 records.

## Overall Assessment

St. Charles Redmond provides a competent but undifferentiated records-request process. The form itself is technically well-made — fillable, bilingual, well-organized — but it funnels patients through a generic authorization framework that wasn't designed for individual access. The wet-ink signature requirement undermines the otherwise digital-friendly form design, and the lack of fee transparency or Right of Access language represents missed opportunities. The MyChart alternative partially compensates but doesn't cover the full record history. Overall, this is a **C-grade** experience: functional and findable, but not patient-centered.
