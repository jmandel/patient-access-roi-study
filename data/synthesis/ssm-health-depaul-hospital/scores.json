      "rationale": "Rubric level 3: requires moderate effort — the form is reachable from SSM Health's medical records page but requires location-dependent navigation with a reportedly broken autocomplete selector, and DePaul's own page only redirects to the system-wide page rather than linking the STL metro form directly."
    },
    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 4: mostly digital with one gap — form-2 has 69 fillable fields enabling complete digital form completion, but submission still requires fax, mail, or navigating to the separate MRO Express portal rather than offering integrated online submission from the form itself."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3: adequate but notable problems — the form has a logical top-to-bottom flow and fits on one page, but the language is dense legalese throughout, there are no instructions or plain-language guidance, the single-page compression forces small text, and the dual-purpose structure confuses patients about which fields apply to self-access."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 3: a patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form is oriented toward third-party disclosure, with 'For personal access' buried as a checkbox under Purpose of Disclosure; patients must navigate recipient fields (name, relationship, fax) that don't apply to self-access, with no guidance on what to skip."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 4: minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization or in-person requirement, 30-day timeline and denial review rights stated, fee language is hedged but not excessive; the email delivery warning and misplaced expiration date field are minor issues that don't create illegitimate barriers."

      "grade": "C",
      "summary": "SSM Health DePaul Hospital provides a technically capable fillable PDF form and an online portal option, but the dual-purpose authorization design, legalistic language, and lack of dedicated patient access pathway keep the experience below patient-centered standards."
