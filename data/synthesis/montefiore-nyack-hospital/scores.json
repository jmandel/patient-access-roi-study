      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital with one gap — 39 fillable fields enable digital completion, and fax/email submission is available, but the form must be submitted via fax or email rather than a fully online workflow, and fillable fields lack accessible names."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems — logical section flow and clear headers, but grammatical errors in legal text, person-switching, missing date-of-service fields despite instructions to provide them, and unclear abstract-vs-full-record default."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic HIPAA authorization form serves patients, attorneys, and third parties equally with no differentiation, and makes no reference to the patient's Right of Access."

    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization, no in-person requirement, revocation rights clearly stated, NY-specific sensitive information protections included; fees are simply not mentioned rather than disclosed or waived."
