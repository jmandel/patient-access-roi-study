    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Mostly digital workflow — 25 fillable PDF fields with typed-signature acceptance enabling digital completion, but submission requires fax or physical delivery rather than a fully online workflow."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but notable problems with language complexity — the form front-loads six dense legal disclosures before any patient-fillable fields, uses litigation-oriented language throughout, and Item 6's all-caps discussion restriction is confusing in non-litigation contexts."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the form is a generic third-party authorization (originally for litigation) with 'At request of individual' as one checkbox option; no Right of Access language, no format/delivery choices, no patient portal mention."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — the form correctly includes voluntariness, revocation rights, and redisclosure warnings; no notarization or excessive fees; however SSN collection is unnecessary and the form lacks fee transparency or patient access rights information."

      "summary": "Addabbo provides a functional records request pathway using a fillable state-standard form with typed-signature support, but the litigation-oriented generic authorization form, legalistic language, and lack of a patient-specific access pathway place it in the upper-adequate range."
