      "score": 3,

      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Rubric level 4: minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization required, photocopy/facsimile accepted, revocation section included, but no fee disclosure, incomplete HIPAA citation, and conditioning-of-treatment language uses imprecise 'might' phrasing."
