      "score": 2,

    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: some requirements beyond what the law requires — SSN collection (even last 4 digits) is unnecessary for patient access, ambiguous witness signature line may create barriers, and fee disclosure is vague ('charges may apply' with no amounts)."
