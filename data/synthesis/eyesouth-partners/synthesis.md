# EyeSouth Partners — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

EyeSouth Partners is a practice management organization (PMO) headquartered in Atlanta, GA, operating a network of 60+ affiliated ophthalmology practices across 14 states. It is a HIPAA covered entity with a designated Privacy Officer, but the corporate website is entirely partnership-focused with no patient-facing content. Two ROI forms were retrieved — neither from EyeSouth Partners itself, but from individual affiliates: Center for Sight (Florida) and Georgia Retina (Georgia).

## Available Pathways

A patient seeking records from an EyeSouth Partners affiliate faces a fragmented landscape. The parent organization offers no downloadable form, no patient portal, and no records request page. Its privacy policy directs patients to write to the Privacy Officer at corporate headquarters — a mail-only pathway with no form to guide the request. Individual affiliates handle records requests independently: some offer downloadable PDF forms (Center for Sight, Georgia Retina), others use third-party online portals like Sharecare (Georgia Eye Associates, South Georgia Eye Partners), and at least one has a broken forms page (Georgia Eye Partners, returning 404).

The most relevant forms for patient self-access are the two retrieved PDF forms. **Form 1** (Center for Sight) is a concise, plain-language "Medical Information Release Form" with a patient-friendly tone and 10-business-day processing commitment. **Form 2** (Georgia Retina) is a more detailed "Authorization for Use, Release, or Request of Your Health Information" with HIPAA rights statements but also a $25 fee disclosure and a reason-for-release requirement. Both are one-page, single-purpose authorization forms. Form 1 represents the better patient experience overall and is treated as the primary form for scoring purposes.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

Neither form distinguishes patient self-access from third-party release. Both are generic HIPAA authorization forms designed to move records "to or from" the affiliated practice. There is no dedicated patient access pathway, no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal right to their own records without needing to provide a reason. The parent organization provides no pathway at all — a patient who only knows they received care "under EyeSouth Partners" would struggle to find any usable process.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding forms required significant effort. Direct searches for "EyeSouth Partners" ROI forms returned nothing. The corporate website has no patient resources section. Forms were located only by identifying specific affiliated practices and searching their individual websites. This multi-step, knowledge-dependent process is a major barrier: a patient must already know which specific practice treated them, find that practice's website, and hope a form is posted there.

## Form Document Quality

Both forms have a text layer (not image-only scans) but **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and complete by hand. Form 1 uses plain, accessible language with a logical top-down flow (patient info → sender/receiver → date range → reasons → authorization → signature). Its listing of 11 Center for Sight locations with full addresses and fax numbers is dense but functional for identifying where to send the form. Form 2 is more text-dense, with rights disclosures consuming half the page and no visual section headers or dividers. Neither form offers checkboxes for record types, format/delivery options, or electronic submission instructions.

## Barriers and Compliance

Form 1 contains an indefinite authorization ("will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing") with no automatic expiration — potentially problematic under HIPAA § 164.508. Form 2 discloses a flat $25 fee for record reproduction without distinguishing patient access requests (where HIPAA fee limits apply) from third-party releases. Form 2 also asks patients to "list the reason for releasing this information," which HIPAA does not require for patient access. Neither form requires notarization or witness signatures. Both imply fax submission is available through listed fax numbers. Form 2 is dated June 2016 — nearly a decade old, predating the HHS Right of Access Initiative and the Cures Act information blocking rules.

## Notable Strengths

- Form 1's 10-business-day processing commitment sets a clear, HIPAA-compliant expectation
- Form 1's warm closing ("we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care") is unusually humanizing
- Both forms are appropriately concise at one page each
- No notarization or witness requirements on either form

## Overall Assessment

EyeSouth Partners presents a below-average patient experience for records access. The fundamental problem is structural: a decentralized PMO with no centralized patient-facing process, forcing patients to navigate affiliate-specific pathways that vary widely in approach and quality. The best available forms are generic authorization documents that don't recognize patient self-access as a distinct use case. While the forms themselves are functional and concise, their paper-first design (no fillable fields), lack of patient rights language, and compliance issues (indefinite authorization, flat fee, reason requirement) prevent them from achieving more than a middling score. The organization earns a **C** grade, reflecting adequate but unexceptional service that requires a patient to work harder than necessary to exercise their access rights.
