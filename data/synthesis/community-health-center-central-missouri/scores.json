    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds; fax submission available — the PDF has a text layer but zero fillable fields, requiring print-and-handwrite, though patients can submit via fax or email."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems — the one-page form has logical flow but the FROM/TO structure confuses self-access patients, the acknowledgment is dense legalese in one paragraph, and the form contains typos and ZIP code inconsistencies."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic authorization form treats all disclosures identically with no dedicated patient access pathway, no Right of Access language, and a FROM/TO structure designed for provider-to-provider transfers."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — the witness signature is not HIPAA-mandated, sensitive records are bundled without granular consent (potential 42 CFR Part 2 issue), and fees are not disclosed."
