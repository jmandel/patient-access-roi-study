# Community Health Center of Central Missouri — Org-Level Synthesis

## Available Forms and Pathways

Community Health Center of Central Missouri (CHCCMO), an independent nonprofit FQHC with four clinic locations across central Missouri, publishes a single general-purpose ROI form — an "Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information." Two versions were found: a current 2025 update (form-1) and a superseded 2023 version (form-2). Both are hosted as publicly accessible WordPress uploads on chccmo.org. There is no online portal, no patient portal–based request pathway, and no dedicated patient access form. The PDF form, submitted by fax, mail, email, or in-person pickup, is the only pathway.

## Access Pathway: No Individual Access Differentiation

CHCCMO does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party release. Both versions use a generic FROM/TO routing structure designed for provider-to-provider transfers. The 2025 form asks patients to specify "Please send my records FROM" and "Please send my records TO," with checkboxes for CHCCMO or "Other" at each end. A patient wanting their own records must navigate this structure, filling in their personal information in the TO field — a workflow clearly designed for transfers between entities, not for individual access under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). Neither form references HIPAA, the Right of Access, or patient access rights beyond a brief acknowledgment section.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **trivially easy**. A standard web search immediately returned direct PDF links. No site navigation, bot blocking, login walls, or browser fallback was needed. The filename (`Release-of-Records-updated-2025.pdf`) is descriptive. However, the older 2023 version remains publicly accessible at a different URL with no indication it is superseded, which could confuse patients who find it via search.

## Form Document Quality

The 2025 form (form-1) is the primary document and represents the organization's current offering. It is a single-page, digitally created PDF with a clean text layer, but it has **zero fillable fields** — patients must print and handwrite all entries. The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → sender/receiver routing → delivery method → record types → date range → purpose → acknowledgment → signature. However, the page is densely packed, and the multi-column layout in the record type and purpose sections may fragment reading order. The acknowledgment section is a single dense paragraph of legal boilerplate rather than numbered, digestible points.

Positive document features include email as a delivery option (alongside fax, mail, and pickup), preset date range options ("Last 12 months" / "Last 24 months"), and a comprehensive list of 10 named record categories. The form is concise at one page. However, it contains a misspelled heading ("AKNOWLEDGEMENT") and inconsistent ZIP codes between the form body and footer (65101 vs. 65110).

## Barriers

The form requires a **witness signature**, which HIPAA does not mandate. This creates a procedural barrier, particularly for patients completing the form at home. The sensitive records clause bundles all sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, genetic testing) into a single all-or-nothing authorization without granular opt-in/opt-out, which may conflict with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder records. The 2025 form does not mention fees, leaving the cost question ambiguous; the older 2023 version references potential copying costs. No notarization is required. Submission can be done via fax or email, so physical delivery is not the only option.

## Notable Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**: Extremely easy findability; concise one-page form; email as a delivery option (uncommon among ROI forms); preset date range options reduce friction; comprehensive record type selection; non-conditioning and revocation language included.

**Weaknesses**: No dedicated patient access pathway — patients are funneled through a generic third-party authorization form; no fillable PDF fields despite being digitally created; witness requirement adds unnecessary friction; sensitive records bundling; typos and address inconsistencies in the form; no HIPAA Right of Access language; no response time commitment in the 2025 version (the 2023 version mentions 30 days).

## Overall Assessment

CHCCMO makes its ROI form easy to find and keeps it concise, but the form itself reflects a provider-centric rather than patient-centric design philosophy. It treats all records requests — whether from patients, insurers, attorneys, or other providers — identically through a generic authorization form. The lack of fillable fields, the witness requirement, and the absence of any Right of Access language mean that a patient requesting their own records faces unnecessary friction and receives no acknowledgment that this is a right, not a favor. The organization earns credit for easy findability and electronic submission options, but falls short on technical accessibility, patient-centeredness, and compliance hygiene.
