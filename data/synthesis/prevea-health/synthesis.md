# Prevea Health — Organization Synthesis

## Overview

Prevea Health is an independent nonprofit physician practice based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It offers a single authorization form — an "Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information" (PRV_839, rev. 0118) — as its primary mechanism for patients to request their own medical records. The same form is available in four languages: English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. No separate patient access–specific form or online portal was identified.

## Access Pathway

Prevea Health uses a **generic HIPAA authorization form** rather than a dedicated patient access form. However, the form explicitly accommodates patient self-requests: Section 3 ("To Disclose To") includes a "Self" checkbox with delivery options (pick up, mail, on-site viewing, electronic format, and email with encrypted/unencrypted options). Section 7 ("Purpose") includes "Patient Request" as a named checkbox option. While this is not a dedicated patient access pathway, the form clearly signals that patients can use it for their own records — placing it above average among generic authorization forms.

The form does not differentiate the legal basis for patient self-access (HIPAA § 164.524) from third-party release (§ 164.508), but the practical workflow is reasonably clear for a patient who wants their own records.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **effortless**. A site-scoped web search immediately surfaced the PDF, and the form is directly linked from the Patient Forms and Documents > Medical Records page at prevea.com. No bot blocking, CAPTCHA, or login was encountered. The URL is descriptive. This is a model for how organizations should make forms accessible.

## Form Document Quality

The form is a **single-page, digitally-created PDF** — not a scan — but it has **zero fillable fields**. A patient must print and hand-fill the form (or annotate it in a PDF viewer). This is the form's most significant technical limitation. The layout is logically organized into nine numbered sections with clear headings, and the single-page format keeps things concise. However, the density required to fit everything onto one page makes the rights section (Section 8) extremely cramped and difficult to read.

Section 8 is the form's weakest content area: a ~200-word paragraph of dense legalese with complex nested clauses that would challenge most patients. The rest of the form uses reasonably plain language with clearly labeled fields and checkbox options.

The form provides granular record-type selection (12 categories plus a free-text field) and includes opt-out checkboxes for sensitive information (alcohol/drug abuse, HIV results, mental health) consistent with Wisconsin law and 42 CFR Part 2.

## Barriers

- **No notarization required.** Witness signature is needed only for AODA/Mental Health disclosures, consistent with legal requirements.
- **Fees:** The form states "copy fees may apply" but does not disclose specific amounts — neutral but not fully transparent.
- **Date range default:** If left blank, only records from the past two years are disclosed. This restrictive default is a notable red flag — patients seeking complete records must affirmatively specify a date range, which is unintuitive.
- **Submission instructions absent:** The form provides no guidance on where or how to submit the completed authorization — no fax number, mailing address, or email for the HIM department. A patient who downloads and completes the form has no clear next step.
- **Minor errors:** "42 CRF" (should be CFR) and "e-email" (doubled prefix) suggest limited quality review.
- **HSHS references:** The form references "HSHS" (Hospital Sisters Health System) without explanation, which may confuse patients who know only Prevea Health.

## Bright Spots

- **Multilingual availability** in Hmong, Somali, and Spanish — rare among physician practices and reflective of local demographics.
- **Five delivery options** including electronic format and email with encrypted/unencrypted distinction — well above average.
- **Explicit self-request pathway** via the "Self" checkbox and "Patient Request" purpose option.

## Overall Assessment

Prevea Health provides a reasonably patient-friendly records request experience with genuine accessibility strengths (multilingual forms, electronic delivery options, easy findability). The primary weaknesses are the non-fillable PDF format, missing submission instructions, a restrictive date range default, and dense legalese in the rights section. The form serves patients adequately but falls short of best-in-class due to its paper-oriented workflow and the absence of submission guidance.
