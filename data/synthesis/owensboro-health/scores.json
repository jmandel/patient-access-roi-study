    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds and fax/email submission available — the form has a text layer but zero fillable fields, requiring print-and-handwrite then fax or scan-and-email to submit."
    },
    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Well-organized with minor clarity issues — logical section flow, clear headers, reasonable 2-page length, and a companion instruction document in plain language, though some regulatory terminology in the EHI and rights sections."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic HIPAA authorization form serves all purposes, and patients must determine which fields apply to self-access vs. third-party release, though the 'Me' checkbox and instruction document help."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: Minor ambiguities but nothing materially impeding — no notarization, multiple submission channels, solid rights statement, but the 120-day expiration unnecessarily applied to patient self-access and no fee transparency."

      "summary": "Owensboro Health earns a B through excellent findability, comprehensive format/delivery options, and a rare EHI Export offering, limited by a non-fillable form and lack of a dedicated patient access pathway."
