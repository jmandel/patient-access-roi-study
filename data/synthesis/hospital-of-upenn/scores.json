    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: the PDF form has excellent fillable fields (70) but the form must be submitted via physical mail — fax is restricted, no electronic submission of the authorization form is available; the patient portal provides digital access but the PDF pathway itself requires paper mailing."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: well-organized two-page form with clear section structure, 14 granular record-type checkboxes, separate behavioral health/SUD consent sections, and thorough page-2 instructions; minor issues include unexplained 'Label Area' placeholder and ambulatory carve-out buried in instructions."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: the authorization form is a generic HIPAA disclosure form not designed for patient self-access — patients must fill in their own name as recipient; however, the org does direct patients to the portal for self-access and the form includes an explicit patient rights acknowledgment."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: no notarization required, treatment explicitly not conditioned on signing, HIPAA-aligned response timelines (30/60 days), denial/appeal rights stated; minor ambiguity in fee disclosure referencing state law rather than HIPAA patient access fee limits."

      "summary": "Penn Medicine offers a technically well-crafted fillable PDF and directs patients to a portal for self-access, but the paper authorization form is a generic HIPAA disclosure that requires mail submission and does not distinguish patient access from third-party release."
