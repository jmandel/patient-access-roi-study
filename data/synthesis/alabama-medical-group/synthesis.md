# Alabama Medical Group — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Alabama Medical Group, P.C. is an independent, for-profit, multi-specialty physician practice based in Mobile, Alabama. The organization maintains a well-organized website with a dedicated Patient Resources section, including a clearly labeled "Request Medical Records" page. Two forms were found and evaluated: a general-purpose "Request for Release of Information" form (form-1.pdf) and a narrow "Permission to Give Medical Information" form (form-2.pdf) for authorizing family phone access. Only form-1 is relevant for a patient seeking their own records.

## Access Pathway: Generic Third-Party Authorization

Alabama Medical Group does **not** differentiate between patient self-access and third-party release of information. The sole mechanism for requesting records is form-1, a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form titled "Request for Release of Information." The form is structured around "To Release To" / "To Obtain From" fields — language designed for inter-provider and third-party transfers, not for a patient requesting their own records. A patient would need to place their own name and address in the "Release To" field, which is workable but not intuitive.

There is no dedicated patient access request form, no online portal, and no reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access anywhere on the form. The form frames the entire interaction as consent-to-release rather than as an exercise of a legal right. The purpose checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Evaluation & Treatment, Other) further confirm this is designed for third-party scenarios — a patient requesting their own records would likely select "Other" and write in an explanation.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the form was **easy**. The website is well-organized with a clear path: Patient Resources → Medical Records → Request Medical Records. The form is linked directly from that page as a PDF download. The same form also appears on the "Other Patient Forms" page. No bot blocking, no browser fallback needed, and no significant difficulties were encountered. The duplicate hosting (identical file at two URLs uploaded one month apart) is a minor organizational issue but does not impair access.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1 is a **single-page, flat PDF** — digitally created (not a scan) with a text layer, but **no fillable fields**. Patients must print the form and complete it by hand. The form collects patient name (including maiden name), date of birth, Social Security Number, medical record number, recipient/source information with address/phone/fax, purpose, type of information (free-text), sensitive information consent, and multiple signature lines. The field count is approximately 15–18 data points.

The layout follows a logical top-to-bottom flow and fits on one page, though this density makes it somewhat cramped. Language is a mix of plain English for identification fields and standard legal boilerplate for the authorization terms. The example prompt for specifying record type — "(Example: Office Notes, Labs, In-Office Testing, all records)" — is a helpful touch. The dual signature block for sensitive information consent (specifically permitting vs. specifically not permitting) gives patients clear control.

However, the form lacks submission instructions — no mailing address, fax number, or email address is printed on it. A patient who downloads the PDF would not know how to return it without navigating back to the website or calling the office. There is also no date range field, no delivery format options, and no mention of electronic delivery.

## Barriers and Concerns

**SSN collection** is the most notable red flag. The form requests a Social Security Number as a standard field, which is unnecessary for a medical records request and creates an identity theft risk. The **employee/witness signature line** at the bottom is ambiguous — if required, it would effectively mandate in-person submission, a significant barrier not required by HIPAA. **No fees are mentioned** on the form, which leaves uncertainty about costs. **No response time** is stated.

The form was uploaded in February 2018 and has apparently not been updated since, suggesting the organization has not revisited its records request process in approximately eight years.

## Notable Strengths

- Easy findability with clear website navigation
- Concise one-page form
- Helpful example text for record type specification
- Clean sensitive information consent design with explicit opt-in/opt-out

## Overall Assessment

Alabama Medical Group provides a **functional but dated** records request process. The form is easy to find and reasonably concise, but it funnels patients through a generic third-party release authorization with no acknowledgment of patient access rights. The flat PDF with no fillable fields, no submission instructions, and no electronic submission pathway creates a primarily paper-based workflow. The SSN collection and ambiguous witness requirement are concerning. This is a practice that has not modernized its records access process to reflect current patient expectations or HIPAA right-of-access principles.
