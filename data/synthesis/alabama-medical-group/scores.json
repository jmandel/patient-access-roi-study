    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Primarily a paper workflow — flat PDF with zero fillable fields requires printing and handwriting; no electronic submission method (fax, email, or portal) is documented on the form or in retrieval notes."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 2,
      "rationale": "Level 2: Patient self-access is not addressed — form is entirely framed as third-party release authorization with no right-of-access language, no 'patient self-request' purpose option, and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal right to their records."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements that may go beyond what the law requires — SSN collection is unnecessary for patient access, ambiguous witness line could constitute an extra-legal barrier; standard revocation/expiration terms and re-disclosure warning are appropriate."
