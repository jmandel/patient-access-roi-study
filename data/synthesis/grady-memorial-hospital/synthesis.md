# Grady Memorial Hospital — Org-Level Synthesis

## Overview

Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's major public safety-net hospital operating under Grady Health System, provides patients with a generic HIPAA authorization form for all records requests. Three PDF documents were found: a current authorization form (form-1, revised 2/22), an older superseded version (form-2, revised 5/15), and a combined instructions-plus-form package (form-3, bundling the older form with a COVID-era cover page). None of these forms are tailored specifically for patient self-access — all are structured as "Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information," framing the process as a release between two parties rather than an individual exercising their right of access.

## Access Pathway

Grady does not differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third party requesting someone else's records. All requesters use the same authorization form with identical "Request Information From" / "Release Information To" fields. A patient requesting their own records must fill in both sides, effectively addressing the form to themselves. The form does include "Personal" as a purpose option, and the documentation requirements section on page 2 distinguishes "Patients Requesting Their Own Medical Records" from third-party requests — but this distinction lives in the supporting text, not in the form design itself. There is no dedicated patient access form, no online request portal, and no reference to HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524).

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was straightforward. A single web search immediately surfaced the main authorization form and the medical records page at gradyhealth.org/medical-records/. All three PDFs were directly downloadable without login, bot blocking, or broken links. The medical records page provides clear context for the forms. This earns high marks for findability.

## Form Document Quality

Form-1, the current primary form, is a 2-page digitally-created PDF with a text layer and clean layout. However, it has **zero fillable fields** — all blanks are rendered as underscores requiring print-and-handwrite completion. For a digitally-created document with 12 embedded fonts, this is a missed opportunity. The form is logically organized (demographics → from/to parties → date range → record types → purpose → format/method → legal notices → signature) with clear section delineation. The record type selection offers approximately 25 checkboxes across three categories (Hospital Visits, Office Visits, Diagnostic Imaging), giving patients granular control.

The language is mostly accessible, with the opening instruction plainly stating what the form does. However, the legal sections contain dense language including a broad liability waiver: "I will not hold Grady... responsible for anything that may happen from the use or release of my PHI." The completeness warning — "If any selection is incomplete, this form may be considered invalid" — could discourage submission if patients are uncertain about any field.

## Submission & Delivery

Critically, **submission options are limited to in-person drop-off and postal mail only**. The form-3 cover page explicitly lists only these two options for submitting the completed form. No fax number is provided for form submission, no email submission is available, and no online portal exists. This means a patient cannot complete the entire process without either physically visiting the hospital or waiting for postal mail.

For *receiving* records, options are better: the current form-1 offers encrypted email delivery, paper, CD, mail, pick-up, and fax (continuing care only). Form-3's cover page also references electronic delivery through CIOX Health (now Datavant), with 2-business-day processing for electronic and 7–10 days for mail.

## Barriers & Bright Spots

**Red flags**: The broad liability waiver bundled into the authorization is the most significant concern — patients should not be asked to waive accountability as a condition of records access. The form also collects the last four digits of SSN, which exceeds what's needed when photo ID is also required. Mandatory government-issued photo ID may burden patients of a safety-net hospital who lack such documentation.

**Bright spots**: The encrypted email delivery option on form-1 is genuinely uncommon and valuable. The form-3 cover page provides excellent operational guidance — processing timelines, fee disclosure ($6.50 max), and the note that continuing care requests are free. Multiple delivery format options (paper, CD, email) give patients real choice in how they receive records.

## Overall Assessment

Grady Memorial Hospital makes its forms easy to find and offers some progressive delivery options, but falls short on two critical dimensions: the forms are entirely paper-based (non-fillable, print-and-handwrite only) and submission requires physical delivery. The generic authorization form does not center patient self-access, and the liability waiver raises compliance concerns. For a major public hospital, the absence of any digital submission pathway and the reliance on a third-party release form for patient access represent meaningful barriers. **Grade: C.**
