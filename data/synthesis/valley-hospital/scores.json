    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: The organization's primary pathway is an online portal with digital identity verification, providing a mostly digital workflow. However, all four PDF forms have zero fillable fields, meaning the fallback paper pathway requires print-and-handwrite completion."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 4,
      "rationale": "Level 4: The best PDF form (form-1) is well-organized with clear Section A/B structure, a full page of step-by-step instructions with practical examples, and reasonable field count (~22). Minor issues with dense sensitive-information legal language and a duplicate checkbox label."

    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The online portal suggests patient-centric direction, but all four PDF forms are generic HIPAA authorization forms requiring patients to write 'SELF' as the recipient — patient self-access is accommodated but not the primary design purpose. Four overlapping entity-specific forms add confusion."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: The 'Entire medical record' checkbox misleadingly excludes behavioral health records; fee disclosure is vague with the older form citing $1/page; blanket ID requirement doesn't distinguish patient access from third-party release. Non-conditioning and revocation rights are properly stated."
