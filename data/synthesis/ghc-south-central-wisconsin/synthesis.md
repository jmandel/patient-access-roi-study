# Synthesis: Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin

## Overview

Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (GHC-SCW) is a nonprofit, independent physician practice in Madison, WI. It publishes two distinct ROI-related PDF forms, plus a Spanish-language version of one of them, on a well-organized public forms page. Critically, GHC-SCW is one of the relatively rare organizations that offers a **dedicated patient self-access form** separate from its general third-party authorization — a meaningful structural distinction that demonstrates thoughtful process design around patient rights.

## Forms and Pathways

**Form 1** ("Authorization to Release Protected Health Information From GHC-SCW") is a 2-page general HIPAA authorization form oriented toward third-party release. It covers scenarios like transferring care, insurance, disability determinations, and legal use, with "Personal Use" available as one checkbox option. A Spanish version is also published. While usable for patient self-access, the framing, language, and workflow are designed around the third-party release use case.

**Form 2** ("Patient Request for Health Information Form") is a 1-page, fillable PDF designed specifically for patients requesting their own records. This is the primary form for patient self-access and the basis for scoring. It uses plain-English question-based section headers ("What records do you want?", "How would you like your records delivered?"), offers granular record-type checkboxes with date range scoping, and provides multiple delivery options including paper, email (encrypted by default), CD, USB, and MyChart portal delivery.

## Access Pathway Differentiation

GHC-SCW clearly differentiates patient self-access from third-party release by maintaining two separate forms. Form 2 is purpose-built for the individual access use case, with simpler language, fewer fields, and a patient-centered workflow. This is a best practice that most organizations do not follow — the typical approach is a single generic authorization form that patients must navigate regardless of whether they're requesting their own records or authorizing release to a third party.

## Retrieval Experience

Finding the forms was effortless. The first web search returned the direct PDF URL, and the organization's forms page at ghcscw.com/members/forms/ is cleanly organized with a "Release of Information Forms" section. No bot blocking, login walls, or CAPTCHA were encountered. One minor quirk: Form 2 was listed under "Health Insurance Forms" rather than "Release of Information Forms," which could cause a patient browsing specifically for ROI forms to miss the more patient-friendly option.

## Form Document Quality

Form 2 is technically excellent: a fully fillable PDF with 49 interactive fields on a single page. The layout is clean and logically ordered (demographics → record selection → delivery method → recipient → signature). The language is accessible and avoids legalese. The form explicitly references the patient's HIPAA right of access and sets a transparent processing timeline of 5 business days.

Form 1, by contrast, has zero fillable fields despite being digitally authored, and explicitly prohibits electronic signatures — creating a print-sign-scan workflow that undermines electronic submission. However, since Form 2 is the primary patient access pathway and is fully fillable, the organization's overall technical accessibility is strong.

## Barriers and Concerns

**Fees**: Form 2 states "There may be charges associated with processing a request" without specifying amounts. The notes mention CIOX Health as the ROI vendor and note that "CIOX requires payment for medical records." Fee vagueness leaves patients unable to anticipate costs, and the CIOX involvement raises questions about whether fees are limited to HIPAA's cost-based standard for patient access.

**Submission instructions gap**: Form 2 lacks any indication of where or how to submit the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, or email. Patients must refer to Form 1 or the website for submission details. Form 1 provides mail, fax (608-441-3499), email (ghcroi@ghcscw.com), and in-person drop-off as options.

**No notarization or witness required**. No in-person requirement for submission.

## Notable Strengths

- **Dedicated patient access form** separate from third-party authorization — a genuine best practice
- **Fully fillable PDF** with 49 interactive fields on one concise page
- **Multiple delivery formats**: paper, encrypted email, CD, USB, MyChart portal
- **Encrypted email as default** with opt-in for unencrypted — privacy by design
- **Spanish-language version** of Form 1 available
- **Plain-language, question-based headers** make the form approachable
- **Transparent processing timeline** (5 business days)

## Overall Assessment

GHC-SCW demonstrates strong patient-centeredness by maintaining a dedicated, well-designed patient access form that is technically fillable, concisely written, and offers flexible delivery options including portal-based delivery. The main weaknesses are the vague fee disclosure, the absence of submission instructions on Form 2 itself, and the use of CIOX Health as the ROI vendor (which may introduce fee concerns). Despite these gaps, the organization's approach to patient record access is meaningfully above average and reflects intentional design around patient rights.
