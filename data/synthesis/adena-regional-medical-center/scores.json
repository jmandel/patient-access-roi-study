    "technical_accessibility": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Usable digitally with workarounds; fax submission available — the form is a text-based PDF but has zero fillable fields, requiring print-and-handwrite workflow; fax submission is available as an electronic submission pathway."

    "content_design": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Adequate but has notable problems with clarity, language complexity, or unnecessary length — single-page design is efficient but layout is cramped, language is moderately legalistic, and the 'Administrative Use Only' driver's license field at the top is confusing."
    },
    "patient_centeredness": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: A patient can use the process but it wasn't designed for them — the generic third-party authorization form requires patients to figure out which checkboxes apply to self-access, with no Right of Access language or dedicated patient pathway."
    },
    "compliance": {
      "score": 3,
      "rationale": "Level 3: Some requirements or language that may go beyond what the law requires for patient access — witness signature not required by HIPAA, fee language references Ohio Law without acknowledging HIPAA fee caps for patient access, and psychotherapy gating could be improperly applied to patient requests."
