# Evaluation: Fallon Medical Complex — form-3.pdf

## Document: Notice of Privacy Practices

---

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)**, not a Release of Information (ROI) authorization form. It is a 3-page HIPAA-required document titled "NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES" with the subtitle "THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION." The document carries an effective date of February 16, 2026, and includes an acknowledgement of receipt signature block on the final page.

Fallon Medical Complex publishes three documents on its Information Management page. Form-1 is the primary ROI authorization ("Authorization for Access, Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)"), form-2 is a "Verbal Release of Information" form, and this document (form-3) is the NPP — a compliance/informational document that accompanies the release forms but is not itself used to request records. It provides the legal backdrop for the ROI process by describing permissible uses/disclosures and patient rights.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The NPP was found on the same Information Management page (https://www.fallonmedical.org/information-management) as the two ROI forms, directly linked under a "Patient Forms" section. Retrieval notes indicate it took only two web searches to locate this page, and all three documents were publicly accessible without login or bot blocking. The source URL (`https://storage.googleapis.com/cardsetter-tmp-user-assets/fallon-medical/FMCCAH%20%20NoticeOfPrivacyPractices%2002.16.2026%20sls.pdf`) is hosted on Google Cloud Storage via what appears to be a Cardsetter CMS asset bucket. The filename is reasonably descriptive ("FMCCAH NoticeOfPrivacyPractices 02.16.2026 sls"), though the "sls" suffix (likely staff initials) is an internal artifact.

Overall findability is **good** — one click from a clearly labeled page. However, grouping the NPP alongside the ROI forms under "Patient Forms" without distinguishing document types could cause confusion for a patient looking specifically for a records request form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Format**: PDF, 251 KB, 3 pages — reasonable file size for a text document.
- **Text layer**: Present and complete. Full text is extractable (8,966 characters), confirming this is a natively digital PDF, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (0) interactive form fields. The acknowledgement-of-receipt section on page 3 (signature, printed name, relationship, date) is static — it must be printed, signed, and returned physically. This is typical for NPPs and not a significant usability concern since the NPP is primarily informational.
- **Fonts**: 12 fonts used, suggesting intentional formatting with hierarchy (headings, body, etc.).
- **Embedded images**: 3 (likely the facility logo repeated on each page header).
- **Image-only scan**: No — this is a digitally authored document.

The document is technically sound as a digital artifact. The lack of fillable fields is a minor limitation only relevant to the acknowledgement section.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 3 pages, which is concise for an NPP. Many organizations produce 6–10 page NPPs; this is refreshingly brief.

**Structure**: The document is organized into 9 clearly numbered sections:
1. Uses and Disclosures Without Written Authorization
2. Disclosures Unless You Object
3. Uses and Disclosures with Written Authorization
4. Substance Use Disorder Records
5. Redisclosure
6. Your Rights Concerning Your Protected Health Information
7. Changes to This Notice
8. Complaints
9. Contact Information
(Plus a final "Effective Date" section oddly numbered "1." instead of "10.")

**Clarity**: The language is relatively accessible for a legal document, though still formal. Terms like "45 CFR Part 164" and "42 CFR part 2" appear without plain-language explanation. The rights section (§6) uses clear bullet points and provides practical examples (e.g., "you or someone on your behalf pays for an item or service, and you request that information concerning such item or service not be disclosed to a health insurer").

**Layout**: Each page includes a consistent header with facility name, address, phone number, and website. The footer includes the document identifier "FMCCAH – NoticeOfPrivacyPractices 02.16.2026 sls (Forms/HIPAA)" with page numbers. Sections are numbered and bullet points are used for lists, creating reasonable visual hierarchy.

**Fee language**: The document states: "Except as prohibited by Montana law, we may charge you a reasonable cost-based fee for providing the records." This is appropriately vague (not specifying dollar amounts in the NPP) and correctly references cost-based fees. It also notes "You may receive the first accounting within a 12-month period free of charge."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

As an NPP, this document's patient-centeredness is measured by how well it explains patient rights rather than by records-request functionality.

**Rights explanation**: Section 6 covers the right to inspect and copy records, request amendments, request restrictions, request confidential communications, receive an accounting of disclosures, and obtain a paper copy of the NPP. Each right includes a brief explanation. The right to access records specifically states: "You may inspect and obtain a copy of records that are used to make decisions about your care or payment for your care, including an electronic copy, and such record will be provided in compliance with Montana law."

**Actionability**: The document directs patients to "submit a written request to the Privacy Officer" to exercise rights and provides complete contact information: name (Susan Stevens), phone number with extension, mailing address, and email (slsteven@fallonmedical.org). The complaints section mentions both the internal complaint process and the option to file with the Secretary of HHS, though no HHS contact details are provided.

**Electronic copy mention**: The document does mention the right to an electronic copy, which is a positive signal. However, it provides no detail about format options or how to request electronic delivery.

**Limitations**: No mention of turnaround times, no reference to the specific ROI forms (form-1 or form-2) that patients should use, and no links to online forms from within the NPP. A cross-reference to the authorization form would improve the patient journey.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**HIPAA compliance**: The document covers the required NPP elements under 45 CFR § 164.520: description of uses/disclosures, patient rights, duties of the covered entity, complaint process, contact information, and effective date. It references both HIPAA (45 CFR Part 164) and 42 CFR Part 2 (substance use disorder records).

**Montana law reference**: The document references Montana law regarding fees and record provision: "such record will be provided in compliance with Montana law" and "Except as prohibited by Montana law, we may charge you a reasonable cost-based fee." This is appropriate for a Montana facility.

**Fee structure**: The cost-based fee reference aligns with HIPAA requirements. The NPP does not specify exact amounts, which is common practice.

**Self-pay restriction right**: Correctly notes the limited restriction right for self-pay situations per the 2013 HIPAA Omnibus Rule.

**No barriers noted**: The NPP does not impose any unusual requirements. The complaint process correctly notes "We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Numbering error on page 3**: The "Effective Date" section is numbered "1." instead of what should logically be "10." following section 9 (Contact Information). This appears to be a formatting or pagination error: `"1. Effective Date. This Notice is effective February 16, 2026"`.
- **Typo**: Section 2 contains "We may also disclosure your religious affiliation to clergy" — "disclosure" should be "disclose."
- **Document version identifier**: The footer contains `37011326_v1` on the last page, which appears to be an internal document management system reference that was not removed before publication.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No HHS complaint contact**: The document says "You may complain to us or to the Secretary of Health and Human Services" but provides no address, phone number, or URL for HHS OCR. A patient unfamiliar with the federal complaint process would not know how to follow through.
- **No cross-reference to ROI forms**: The NPP explains the right to access records and instructs patients to "submit a written request to the Privacy Officer," but does not reference the actual authorization forms (form-1 and form-2) available on the same webpage. A patient reading only the NPP might not know these forms exist.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Concise length**: At 3 pages, this is a notably compact NPP that covers all required elements without excessive legal padding. Many comparable facilities produce NPPs twice this length.
- **Named Privacy Officer with direct contact**: Providing a specific person's name (Susan Stevens), direct phone extension (5461), and individual email address (slsteven@fallonmedical.org) is more patient-friendly than the generic "Privacy Officer" or departmental email seen at many facilities.
- **Substance use disorder records section**: Including a dedicated section (§4) on 42 CFR Part 2 protections for SUD records demonstrates awareness of the additional protections required for these sensitive records — something many small facilities omit.
- **Recent effective date**: The February 16, 2026 date indicates this NPP is very current, suggesting active compliance maintenance.
