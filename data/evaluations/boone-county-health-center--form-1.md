# Evaluation: Boone County Health Center — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a single-page "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form, dated "Revised 7-2017" per the footer. The header identifies it as belonging to "BOONE COUNTY HEALTH CENTER AND MEDICAL CLINICS" at 723 West Fairview Street, Albion, NE 68620. It is a **general-purpose release form** — it handles both outbound disclosure ("Release Records FROM") and inbound requests ("TO"), rather than being specific to patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access.

This form is the **older of two ROI forms** found for the organization. A newer version (form-2, "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information") was uploaded to the website in February 2026 with an updated address (1173 South 8th Street), an email address for the ROI department, and several content revisions. The older form-1 PDF remains accessible at its direct URL but is no longer linked from the Patient Forms page. A third document (form-3) is a HIPAA Contact Information form for designating authorized contacts, explicitly noted as "not a substitute for a Release of Information form."

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, the form was **easy to find** — it was discoverable through basic web searches for `"Boone County Health Center" "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` and was originally linked from the General Information page under Patient Resources. The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Release_of_Health_Information_Form_August_2017.pdf`) is descriptive and uses a clear filename. However, this specific form is now a **stale artifact** — the website's Patient Forms section has replaced it with the newer .docx version (form-2). A patient following current website navigation would find form-2, not form-1. The fact that form-1 remains indexable by search engines while no longer being the current version creates a risk that patients may download and submit an outdated form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The full text (3,332 characters) is extractable, confirming this is a natively digital PDF, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being a born-digital PDF, it has no interactive form fields. Patients must print, fill by hand, and scan or deliver physically.
- **File size**: 260 KB for a single page — somewhat large for a text-based single-page form, likely due to the embedded image (logo). Not unreasonable, but not optimized.
- **Page count**: 1 page, which is appropriately compact.
- **Font count**: 5 fonts, indicating some typographic structure.
- **Digital-first design**: This is a born-digital document (not a scan), but it was designed for print-and-fill workflow. There are no fillable fields, no hyperlinks, and no electronic submission instructions. The delivery format options ("Paper copies [ ] Fax [ ] CD [ ] USB Memory Stick/ Thumb Drive [ ]") all assume physical/in-person exchange. There is no email or electronic submission option — a gap addressed in the newer form-2 which adds "Encrypted Email."

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and organization**: The form fits on a single page with five numbered sections plus acknowledgment/signature blocks. The logical flow is reasonable: (1) Patient identification, (2) Release FROM/TO, (3) Dates of service, (4) Purpose, (5) Health information to be disclosed.

**Clarity**: The opening sentence — "By signing this form, you permit Boone County Health Center and/or Medical Clinics to disclose your confidential personal health information" — is straightforward. The numbered sections are clear. However, some areas are dense. The acknowledgment block packs five bullet points into a tight area with small formatting.

**Layout**: As a single-page form, it is necessarily cramped. The FROM/TO fields in section 2 are laid out side-by-side, which is space-efficient but could be confusing. The checkbox sections use a non-standard checkbox character ("⃞") that renders as a combining mark rather than a proper checkbox glyph — this is a minor rendering issue in the extracted text.

**Fee language**: The fee disclosure appears in two places with inconsistent formatting:
- Section 4 states: "0.25 copy fee may apply (personal or legal reasons)" next to the Personal Record/Disability/Other checkboxes
- The acknowledgment section states: "I realize I will be charged a copy fee of : 0:25 cents per page plus postage."

The notation "0:25 cents per page" is ambiguous — it likely means $0.25 per page, but the colon notation and phrasing "0:25 cents" could be read as 0.25 cents (i.e., a quarter of one cent), which is obviously not intended.

**Sensitive information**: The form includes specific authorization checkboxes for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV/AIDS-related information, with "Please initial" instructions next to each. This is appropriate for Nebraska law requirements around these categories.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form does **not** distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. The structure with "Release Records FROM" and "TO" fields treats all disclosures identically. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), no reference to patient rights, and no acknowledgment that patients have a legal entitlement to their records.

**Scope options**: The form offers reasonable granularity for record selection — 12 specific record type checkboxes (History & Physical, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, X-Ray Reports, ER Records, Consultation Reports, EKG/Cardiac Records, Immunization Record, Therapies, Billing Information, Discharge Plan, Discharge Report). Date-of-service options include "Current," "1 Year," and "2 Years," with a note: "If dates are not provided only the past year will be sent."

**Format options**: Limited to physical formats: "Paper copies [ ] Fax [ ] CD [ ] USB Memory Stick/ Thumb Drive [ ]." No electronic delivery option (email, portal, etc.). The newer form-2 adds encrypted email.

**Expiration**: The authorization states it "is effective for _____ months after the date it was signed," leaving the duration as a blank fill-in. This puts the burden on the patient (or staff) to determine an appropriate timeframe, with no default or guidance. The newer form-2 resolved this by setting a fixed 12-month expiration.

**EHI/bulk export**: No mention of electronic health information export, patient portals, or bulk data access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee disclosure**: The form states "I realize I will be charged a copy fee of : 0:25 cents per page plus postage." Under HIPAA, for patient access requests, fees may only cover the cost of labor for copying, supplies, and postage. The $0.25 per page flat fee is within the HIPAA safe harbor of $0.10/page for paper or the "reasonable, cost-based fee" standard, though $0.25 may be at the high end. However, the form makes no distinction between patient-access fees and third-party disclosure fees — the same fee appears to apply universally. For patient access requests specifically, HIPAA limits what can be charged, and a per-page fee for electronic copies is generally not permitted.

**Identification requirement**: The form includes "Verified with photo identification and copied" with an employee signature line, suggesting photo ID is required and photocopied. While identity verification is reasonable, photocopying IDs may create unnecessary friction and data-retention concerns.

**No submission instructions**: The form provides no guidance on how to submit — no address for mailing, no fax number for form submission (though a general HIM fax is in the header), no email, no mention of in-person drop-off or portal upload.

**Revocation**: The form correctly notes the right to revoke authorization in writing, and that revocation won't apply to actions already taken.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **No distinction between patient access and third-party release**: The form treats all disclosures identically. A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access has different rights (shorter timelines, fee limits) than a third-party authorization. This form provides no pathway for patients to assert those rights.
- **Fee applied universally without distinguishing request type**: The "$0.25 per page plus postage" fee is stated as applying to all requests. For patient access requests, HIPAA limits fees more strictly, and electronic copies should not be charged per page.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **"0:25 cents per page"**: The colon-separated notation and the word "cents" make the fee amount ambiguous. Does this mean $0.25 (25 cents) or 0.25 cents (a quarter of a cent)? Almost certainly intended as $0.25, but the formatting is confusing.
- **Blank expiration period**: "This authorization is effective for _____ months" leaves the duration entirely undefined. If a patient leaves it blank, it's unclear whether the authorization has any expiration — creating both legal ambiguity and potential patient risk.
- **"Release Records FROM" / "TO" layout**: The side-by-side layout could confuse patients about which entity is sending and which is receiving, especially when the patient is requesting their own records (who fills in the "TO" field — themselves?).

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Stale document still indexed**: This 2017 form remains accessible at its direct URL and appears in search results, but is no longer the current version. Patients may unknowingly use an outdated form with the old address and without the newer form's encrypted email option.
- **Inconsistent fee presentation**: The fee appears in two places — once as "0.25 copy fee may apply" (section 4) and once as "0:25 cents per page plus postage" (acknowledgment section). The different formatting and wording could cause confusion.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Single-page design**: The entire form fits on one page, reducing patient burden compared to multi-page forms common at larger organizations.
- **Sensitive information handling**: Separate initialing requirements for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV/AIDS information align with Nebraska law and give patients granular control over these categories.
- **Clear non-coercion statement**: "My refusal to sign this authorization will not affect my ability to obtain treatment at BCHC" is prominently stated.
