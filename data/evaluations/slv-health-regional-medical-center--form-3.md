# Evaluation: San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center — form-3.pdf

**Organization:** San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center (Alamosa, CO)
**Document:** form-3.pdf — Spanish-language Authorization to Release Medical Record Information
**Source URL:** `https://www.sanluisvalleyhealth.org/documents/resource%20flyers/Authorization-to-Release-Information-Spanish.pdf`
**Form number:** 000700 (09-22)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3.pdf is the **Spanish-language version** of the organization's Authorization to Release Medical Record Information form. Its title is "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA DIVULGAR INFORMACIÓN DE LA HISTORIA CLÍNICA." It is a direct translation of form-1.pdf (the current English-language 2024 version), sharing the same structure, field layout, record-type options, and form number (000700, revision 09-22). The organization also has an older English-language version (form-2.pdf, revision 08-13) that is no longer actively linked from the website.

This form is a **general third-party release authorization**, not a patient-access-specific form. It is structured around a "DIVULGACIÓN DE" (releasing facility) → "DIVULGACIÓN PARA" (recipient) model, meaning the patient authorizes release of records *to* a named third party. There is no separate pathway for a patient simply requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The Spanish form was **easy to find**. Per the retrieval notes, it is directly linked from the organization's Medical Records page at `https://www.sanluisvalleyhealth.org/patient-center/medical-records/` alongside the English version. Web searches for the organization's authorization form also surfaced it. The URL path (`/documents/resource%20flyers/Authorization-to-Release-Information-Spanish.pdf`) is descriptive, clearly identifying it as the Spanish authorization form.

The fact that the Spanish version is co-located with the English version on the Medical Records page is commendable — it does not require a separate search or navigation path. However, the URL contains a URL-encoded space (`%20`) and the directory is named "resource flyers," suggesting it may be filed alongside marketing materials rather than in a dedicated forms repository.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present. Full text is extractable (3,505 characters), confirming this is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. The form has no interactive PDF form fields. All blanks are represented as underscores in text. Patients must print and fill by hand.
- **File size:** 394,842 bytes (~385 KB) for a single page — moderately large, likely due to the embedded image (organization logo or header graphic). By comparison, the older English form (form-2) is only 86 KB for comparable content.
- **Page count:** 1 page.
- **Font count:** 4 fonts embedded.
- **Digital-first design:** No. This is clearly a **print-oriented document**. The lack of fillable fields and reliance on underscored blank lines means it cannot be completed digitally without third-party annotation tools.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The form is a **single page** with a logical top-to-bottom flow:

1. Header/title
2. Releasing facility information ("DIVULGACIÓN DE")
3. Patient identification (name, SSN, date of birth)
4. Recipient information ("DIVULGACIÓN PARA")
5. General authorization statement
6. Record type checkboxes (5 options plus "Other")
7. Date range limiters (all admissions vs. specific dates)
8. Expiration options (4 choices)
9. Specific authorization for sensitive records (drug, alcohol, psychiatric)
10. Federal regulation notice about substance abuse records
11. Copies clause (MAY/MAY NOT)
12. Signature block (patient or authorized representative)
13. Footer with contact info and facility addresses

**Clarity:** The language is formal but generally understandable Spanish. The authorization statement reads: "Autorizo al proveedor de atención médica nombrado anteriormente a divulgar la información que se indica a continuación a la organización, agencia o individuo mencionados en esta solicitud." This is functional legal Spanish but not plain-language — a patient with limited literacy might struggle.

**Layout:** As a single page, the form is dense. The "(Marque con la inicial según corresponda)" instruction for checkboxes is repeated multiple times. Record-type options are presented with parenthetical checkboxes: "( ) Copia de la historia clínica e informes de la sala de emergencias/hospitalización." The dual-column layout for record types and date ranges attempts to fit considerable content into limited space.

**Readability concern:** The substance abuse disclosure notice is presented as a dense paragraph of small regulatory text: "Las regulaciones federales requieren que el consentimiento para la historia clínica relacionada al alcohol o a las drogas no dure más que lo razonablemente necesario para cumplir la finalidad para la que se otorga la divulgación." This is a long, complex sentence that would challenge many readers.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This form is designed for **third-party release**. The "DIVULGACIÓN PARA" field asks for a recipient's name, address, and contact information. There is no option to simply check "send records to me, the patient." A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name and address in the "DIVULGACIÓN PARA" field, which is unintuitive.

**Scope options:** Reasonable. Five record-type categories are offered:
- ER/Inpatient reports
- Outpatient/clinic records
- Complete medical record
- Last 2 years for transfer of care
- Other (specify)

Date range limiters are available ("Desde: ___ Hasta: ___"), and patients can choose all prior admissions or specific treatment dates.

**Format/delivery options:** The form footer states "ENVÍE LA HISTORIA CLÍNICA POR CORREO ELECTRÓNICO A: MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org" — but this is the **submission** email for the form itself, not an option for receiving records electronically. No delivery format options (electronic, mail, pick-up) are presented to the patient.

**Right of Access language:** None. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524, patient rights, or the right to access one's own health information. No mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

**SSN collection:** The form asks for "Núm. de Seguro Social" (Social Security Number). This is a notable data point — HIPAA does not require SSN for record release authorization, and collecting it creates unnecessary privacy risk.

**Bilingual accessibility:** The existence of this Spanish-language form is itself a patient-centered feature. However, the form footer contact information and facility names remain in English ("San Luis Valley Health is not responsible if lost" appears translated as "San Luis Valley Health no es responsable en caso de extravíos"), suggesting reasonable translation effort.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** The form defaults to 1-year expiration ("esta autorización vencerá automáticamente en 1 año") with three alternatives: a specific date, 180 days, or a custom period tied to the stated purpose. The 1-year default is standard and reasonable.

**Sensitive records:** The form correctly separates authorization for drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and psychological/psychiatric records, requiring specific initialing. It includes the required federal regulation notice about substance abuse records under 42 CFR Part 2.

**Copies clause:** The form includes "Una copia de esta autorización con mi firma en ella ( ) PUEDE; ( ) NO PUEDE; usarse con la misma eficacia que la copia original." This places the burden on the patient to decide whether copies are acceptable, which is unusual — most forms simply accept copies or originals.

**No fee disclosure:** The form does not mention any fees associated with obtaining records. There is no indication of cost, which could be seen positively (no upfront fee deterrent) or negatively (patient has no idea what to expect).

**Submission method:** The email address MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org is provided for submitting completed forms, which suggests electronic submission of the authorization itself is accepted.

**"Not responsible if lost" disclaimer:** The footer states "San Luis Valley Health no es responsable en caso de extravíos." This vague disclaimer is concerning — lost records? Lost forms? It's unclear what they are disclaiming responsibility for, and it may be intimidating to patients.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish-language form available and co-located with English version.** The form is linked directly from the Medical Records page alongside the English version, requiring no extra navigation. For a community hospital in southern Colorado's San Luis Valley — an area with a significant Spanish-speaking population — this is an important accessibility measure.
- **Email submission accepted.** The form can be submitted electronically to MRChartPullRequest@slvrmc.org, which lowers the barrier compared to fax-only or in-person-only submission.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **SSN requested.** The form asks for Social Security Number ("Núm. de Seguro Social"), which is not required by HIPAA for authorization and creates unnecessary identity theft risk, particularly concerning for a vulnerable population.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"No es responsable en caso de extravíos"** — "Not responsible if lost" is vague and potentially intimidating. Lost what? The form? The records? In transit? This disclaimer lacks context and could deter patients from submitting the form.
- **No patient-access pathway.** The form only accommodates release to a named third party. A Spanish-speaking patient trying to obtain their own records would receive no guidance on how to use this form for that purpose.
- **Copies clause puts decision on patient.** The MAY/MAY NOT copies option is unusual and may confuse patients who don't understand the legal implications of either choice.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo "INFORMATION REQUIRIED" carried from English version.** While the Spanish form itself uses "INFORMACIÓN REQUERIDA," the English source (form-1 and form-2) contains "INFORMATION REQUIRIED" — a persistent misspelling across form revisions. The Spanish translation corrected this, but it signals limited quality control on the English side.
- **Form number revision inconsistency.** Form-3 (Spanish) and form-1 (English) both carry form number "000700 (09-22)," yet form-1 was retrieved from a URL suggesting a "2024 update." The form number itself hasn't been updated to reflect the 2024 revision, creating ambiguity about which version is current.
