# Evaluation: CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an **instruction sheet** titled "Instructions for completing Authorization for Release of Health Information." It is a 2-page companion document to the main ROI authorization form (form-1.pdf). It does not itself collect patient information or signatures — it explains how to complete the authorization form (form-1) section by section, provides submission instructions, and includes a full directory of CentraCare HIM/ROI department locations.

This is one of three documents found for CentraCare – Long Prairie Hospital. All three are system-wide CentraCare forms, not facility-specific:
- **form-1.pdf**: The actual authorization form patients fill out
- **form-2.pdf** (this document): Instructions for completing form-1
- **form-3.pdf**: A separate authorization for substance use disorder records (42 CFR Part 2)

Long Prairie Hospital is listed under "Northwest locations" in the directory on page 2, grouped with Sauk Centre as the regional HIM hub.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The instruction document was found on CentraCare's centralized medical records release page at `https://www.centracare.com/patient-resources/medical-records-release/`. It was discoverable through standard web searches for CentraCare authorization/release forms. However, the notes indicate that direct `curl` downloads were blocked ("Access Denied" responses), requiring browser-based download as a workaround.

The document is linked alongside the main authorization form on the same page, which is appropriate — a patient looking for the ROI form would naturally encounter these instructions. There is no Long Prairie–specific page or form; patients must navigate from the system-wide CentraCare site and identify Long Prairie within the directory. For a patient who knows they are part of the CentraCare system, this is reasonably findable. For a patient who only knows "Long Prairie Hospital," the indirection through the system-wide site adds a step.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size**: 177,020 bytes (177 KB) — reasonable for a 2-page document
- **Page count**: 2
- **Text layer**: Yes — full text is extractable (4,334 characters), making it searchable and accessible to screen readers
- **Fillable fields**: 0 — appropriate since this is an instruction document, not a form
- **Fonts**: 7 fonts used
- **Embedded images**: 2 (likely logos or headers)
- **Image-only scan**: No — this is a digitally-created PDF

The document is technically well-constructed. The text layer enables copy-paste, search, and assistive technology use. The 177 KB file size is modest and loads quickly.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The document is organized as a section-by-section walkthrough matching the structure of the authorization form. Each section header matches a section on form-1 (Patient Information, Release Information From, Release Information To, Information to Be Released, Special Disclosure, Preferred Method, Reason for Release, Authorization, Revocation).

**Strengths:**
- Clear, sequential structure that mirrors the form
- Practical guidance like: "If you do not have dates noted, only your last hospital encounter or clinic visit at the specific CentraCare Health location you indicated will be released"
- Explains what each section is for and why it matters (e.g., reason for release "helps us track and assign a priority status to your request" and "allows us to determine who may be responsible for the cost of records")
- The directory on page 2 is comprehensive, listing all CentraCare facilities organized by regional hub with mail addresses, fax numbers, phone numbers, and a shared email

**Weaknesses:**
- The page 2 directory is dense — facilities are listed in a compact, multi-column format that may be difficult for some patients to navigate
- The document refers to "www.centracare.com for a listing of all CentraCare hospital and clinic locations" but also provides the full directory itself, creating mild redundancy
- No mention of expected turnaround time for processing requests
- No mention of fees for copies, despite the main form (form-1) and the reason-for-release section implying costs: "It also allows us to determine who may be responsible for the cost of records (where applicable)"

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

The instructions are written in second person ("you") and use relatively plain language. The tone is informational and helpful rather than legalistic. The document proactively explains *why* certain fields matter, which is unusual and helpful — for example, explaining that the reason for release affects priority and cost determination.

The document offers **multiple submission channels**: email (`CCHROI@CentraCare.com`), fax, and mail — all clearly listed. The email option is prominently displayed on page 1 ("Completed and signed forms can be sent to CCHROI@CentraCare.com") and repeated in the directory. This is a strong patient-access feature.

However, there are gaps:
- No information about fees or cost expectations, leaving patients uncertain about potential charges
- No mention of patient rights under HIPAA (right to access, right to receive records in requested format, right to complain)
- No estimated processing time
- No guidance on what to do if a request is denied or delayed
- The directory groups Long Prairie under the Northwest locations hub in Sauk Centre, which means a patient mailing forms must send them to Sauk Centre (425 Elm Street N, Sauk Centre, MN 56378), not to Long Prairie Hospital directly — this could be confusing

## 6. COMPLIANCE

The instruction document does not itself impose requirements — it describes how to complete the authorization form. Key compliance-relevant observations:

- **Revocation language**: States the authorization "will automatically expire 1 year after your signature unless you indicate another date or event upon which the authorization should expire OR you provide a written revocation to our organization." This mirrors standard HIPAA authorization provisions.
- **42 CFR Part 2 guidance**: Properly explains the Special Disclosure section requirement for substance use disorder records, noting it "is required per Federal Rule 42 CFR Part 2 to be completed in full."
- **No fee disclosure**: The document references cost ("who may be responsible for the cost of records") without stating what fees are or providing a fee schedule. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients requesting their own records are entitled to copies at a reasonable, cost-based fee. The absence of fee information here is a gap, though this is an instruction sheet rather than a fee schedule.
- **Personal representative**: Notes that "The patient or the Patient's personal representative must sign and date this form" and asks for "relationship to the patient and the reason they are unable to sign."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Cost reference without fee information**: The document states the reason for release "allows us to determine who may be responsible for the cost of records (where applicable)" but never discloses what those costs are. A patient reading this has no way to anticipate whether they will be charged, how much, or whether they can challenge a fee.
- **Facility identification burden**: The instruction to "Identify which CentraCare Health hospital, clinic, or provider you are seeking information from" and "Please be specific in your request" places the burden on patients to know exactly which CentraCare facility holds their records. For patients who have been seen at multiple CentraCare locations, this may require multiple separate requests.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Email submission option prominently featured**: `CCHROI@CentraCare.com` is displayed clearly and available for all locations. This is a genuine convenience for patients who can scan or photograph a signed form.
- **Explanations of "why"**: Unlike most instruction documents that merely say what to fill in, this document explains the practical consequences of each field — e.g., how dates affect what gets released, how reason-for-release affects priority and cost assignment. This is unusually transparent and helpful.
- **Delivery method options**: The document notes that records can be provided via print, CD, encrypted email, or MyChart portal — offering meaningful patient choice. The caveat that "If your original records are on paper, we are only able to provide them on paper" is a helpful, honest limitation disclosure.
- **Shared contact information across the system**: A single email address (`CCHROI@CentraCare.com`) works for all CentraCare locations, simplifying the process even when patients aren't sure which regional hub applies.
