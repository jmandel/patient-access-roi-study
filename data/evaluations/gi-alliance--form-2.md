# GI Alliance — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page document titled **"Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party"** bearing the GI Alliance logo. It was sourced from Granite Peaks GI (a GI Alliance affiliate) at `https://www.granitepeaksgi.com/wp-content/uploads/Release-of-Records-GI-Alliance.pdf`. The document was generated by printing from a web-based EHR system — the footer on both pages reveals the URL `https://az-039-c.ggastrocloud.com/gGastro/?status=Logout&message=`, indicating it was printed from the gGastro (gGastroenterology) cloud platform on 1/30/2025. The page headers show "1/30/25, 1:50 PM" and "Printed on 1/30/2025."

The title explicitly frames this as a **third-party release** form, not a patient-access request form. It is designed for situations where records are sent from the provider to another entity (another doctor, insurer, school, etc.). However, "Patient's Request" is listed among the purpose checkboxes, so it could technically be used by a patient requesting their own records, though the form's framing and field structure (especially the "DISCLOSE TO" recipient section) suggest it is primarily designed for third-party disclosures.

In context with the other forms found for GI Alliance:
- **form-1.pdf** is the canonical GI Alliance "Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information" — a cleaner, text-based, 1-page form from the main gialliance.com website. It is more general-purpose and better suited for patient access.
- **form-3.pdf** is a scanned medical release form from University GI (another affiliate), image-only with no text layer.
- **form-2.pdf** occupies a middle ground: affiliate-specific, more detailed in record-type selection, but degraded in digital quality.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **not found on the main GI Alliance website**. It was discovered on an affiliate practice website (Granite Peaks GI) via web search. According to the retrieval notes, finding it required searching beyond the primary gialliance.com domain. The main GI Alliance patient forms page (`gialliance.com/patient-forms-and-prep/`) exists but is organized by local brand/location, adding navigational complexity.

A patient of Granite Peaks GI would need to either know to visit their local affiliate's website or navigate through the GI Alliance umbrella site's location-specific listings. The form's filename (`Release-of-Records-GI-Alliance.pdf`) is descriptive, but the form is hosted in a WordPress uploads directory with no obvious navigational path from the Granite Peaks GI main page confirmed.

Findability is **moderate** — a determined searcher can locate it, but there is no clear, prominent "Request Your Records" link path confirmed for Granite Peaks GI patients specifically.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

This document has significant technical accessibility problems:

- **Effectively an image-only PDF**: While the metadata reports `has_text_layer: true`, the extracted text is entirely garbled control characters (e.g., `\u0012\u000e\u000e\u0013\u0014811\u0015\u0016\u001732...`). The PDF contains a corrupt or nonsensical text layer from the Type 3 font encoding used during the print-to-PDF process via PDFCreator/Ghostscript. The `pdftoppm` conversion generated hundreds of "Bad bounding box in Type 3 glyph" warnings, confirming the text encoding is broken.
- **Not fillable**: Zero fillable form fields (`fillable_field_count: 0`). The patient must print the form and fill it out by hand.
- **Image-based content**: The PDF contains two embedded images (1700×2200 px each, RGB), one per page. The actual readable content exists only in these raster images.
- **File size**: 256 KB for 2 pages — reasonable for image-based content but unnecessarily large compared to a proper text-based PDF.
- **Screen reader inaccessible**: Because the text layer is garbled, screen readers and assistive technologies cannot read this document. It fails WCAG and Section 508 accessibility requirements.
- **No tagged PDF structure**: The PDF is not tagged (`Tagged: no`), meaning it lacks semantic structure even if the text were extractable.
- **No electronic submission**: The form must be printed, hand-completed, and presumably faxed or mailed back. No digital submission pathway is indicated on the form itself.
- **Browser print artifacts**: The document retains browser chrome — timestamps ("1/30/25, 1:50 PM"), print date ("Printed on 1/30/2025"), and the gGastro application URL in the footer, and page numbering ("1/2", "2/2"). These artifacts indicate it was literally a browser print-to-PDF rather than a purpose-built document.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

Despite the technical shortcomings, the visual layout (as seen in the rendered images) is reasonably well-organized:

**Page 1** contains:
- GI Alliance logo and clear title
- Patient identification: Name, Date of Birth, Last 4 Digits of SSN
- Two-column layout for "OBTAIN FROM" and "DISCLOSE TO" sections, both marked "(DO NOT LEAVE BLANK)"
- Obtain From options: specific Provider name, or "All GI Alliance (select if seen by multiple providers)"
- Disclose To fields: Individual/Name of Entity, Address, City/State/Zip, Phone, Fax
- Delivery Method: checkboxes for E-Delivery and Mail
- Purpose checkboxes (8 options): Continuing Medical Care, Insurance, School, Military, Legal Purposes, Social Security/Disability, Patient's Request, Other (specify)
- Date range: Specific Dates with "thru" field, or All Dates checkbox
- Specific Information Request section with 10 checkbox options: All Records, Abstract Record*, Medication Records, Laboratory/Pathology Reports, Radiology Reports, Verbal Communication Only, Office/Progress Notes, Operative Notes, Itemized Billing Statements, Other (Specify)
- Sensitive information acknowledgment and opt-in initials for: HIV/AIDs, Drug/Alcohol Use, Genetic Testing, Mental Health/Developmental Disabilities
- Footnote: "*(Office notes, procedures, images, and test results only)*" defining Abstract Record

**Page 2** contains:
- Authorization duration statement: effective for "one (1) year" from signature date or when patient no longer receives services, whichever is later
- Revocation rights: right to revoke in writing by notifying Provider at [blank address]; Attn: Privacy Officer
- Voluntary statement: "Signing this form is optional. Provider will not condition Patient's treatment or payment for care on whether I sign this form."
- Re-disclosure warning: "Once information is disclosed as a result of this form, it may no longer be protected by the federal HIPAA privacy rules."
- Right to obtain a copy of the form by contacting the Privacy Officer
- Signature block: Signature of Patient or Parent/Representative, Date, Print name, Phone, Relationship to Patient

The form is **text-heavy but logical** in its flow. The two-column "obtain from / disclose to" layout is intuitive. The record-type selection is granular (10 options plus Other), giving patients control over what is released. However, the form reads as a compliance document rather than a patient-friendly guide — there are no plain-language instructions, no explanatory notes about what each record type means, and no guidance on how to submit the completed form.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This form has notable patient-centeredness gaps:

- **Third-party framing**: The title ("Authorization to Release Medical Records to Third Party") signals this is designed for disclosures to others, not for a patient requesting their own records. A patient seeking their own EHI would need to navigate a form that conceptually treats them as authorizing a release *to* someone else.
- **"Patient's Request" is just one of eight purposes**: It is listed alongside Insurance, Legal, Military, etc. — there is no dedicated patient-access pathway or simplified form for this common use case.
- **SSN collection**: The form requests "Last 4 Digits of SSN" for patient identification. While partial SSN is less risky than full SSN, HIPAA does not require SSN for record requests, and collecting it creates unnecessary data exposure risk. Many patients may be uncomfortable providing this.
- **No submission instructions**: The form does not tell the patient where to send the completed form — no fax number, no mailing address, no email address, no portal link. The revocation section references notifying the "Privacy Officer" at a blank address field, but there is no guidance for initial form submission.
- **No fee disclosure**: The form does not mention any fees that may be charged for record copies. Under HIPAA, providers may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee, but patients should be informed upfront.
- **No timeline expectations**: There is no mention of how long the provider will take to process the request (HIPAA allows up to 30 days with a possible 30-day extension).
- **Delivery method options are limited**: Only "E-Delivery" and "Mail" are offered as delivery methods. There is no option for in-person pickup, patient portal delivery, or specification of electronic format preferences.
- **"Verbal Communication Only" as a record type**: This option in the information request section is unusual and unclear — it could mean the patient only wants a verbal summary rather than written records, which could be used to deny written copies.
- **No multilingual support**: The form is English-only.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Authorization duration**: One year, consistent with HIPAA norms. The "or the date on which Patient no longer receives services from Provider, whichever is later" extension is a standard provision.
- **Revocation rights**: Properly disclosed — patient can revoke in writing, and revocation is not retroactive. However, the address for revocation is left blank (a fill-in field), which is problematic if the patient doesn't know where to send revocation.
- **Voluntary statement**: Correctly states that signing is optional and treatment/payment will not be conditioned on signing.
- **Re-disclosure warning**: Present and appropriately stated.
- **Sensitive information**: Properly separates HIV/AIDS, substance use, genetic testing, and mental health/developmental disabilities as requiring specific authorization, consistent with federal and many state laws.
- **No explicit HIPAA citation**: The form references "federal HIPAA privacy rules" but does not cite 45 CFR § 164.508 or other specific regulatory provisions.
- **Third-party release framing vs. patient access**: This form is structured as a § 164.508 authorization for third-party disclosure, not as a § 164.524 patient access request. While it can technically be used for patient access (via the "Patient's Request" checkbox), conflating these two distinct HIPAA rights in a single form may create confusion. Patient access requests under § 164.524 have different rules (lower fee caps, shorter timelines, fewer permissible denials) than third-party authorizations under § 164.508.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **SSN collection**: The form requests "Last 4 Digits of SSN" for patient identification. HIPAA does not require SSN for record access, and collecting it creates unnecessary privacy risk. This could deter patients from completing the form.
- **Third-party form used for patient access**: By channeling patient access requests through a third-party authorization form, the organization may inadvertently apply § 164.508 authorization rules instead of the more patient-favorable § 164.524 access rules. This could result in higher fees, longer processing times, or broader grounds for denial than HIPAA permits for patient access.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions anywhere on the form**: A patient who fills out this form has no indication of where to send it — no fax number, no address, no email. The revocation clause references a Privacy Officer at a blank address, but the form itself provides no submission pathway.
- **"Verbal Communication Only" record type**: This checkbox option is ambiguous. It's unclear whether checking this means the patient wants records communicated verbally (which could be used to avoid providing written copies) or whether it refers to verbal orders/communications in the medical record.
- **"OBTAIN FROM" left partially blank**: The Provider field is blank and the "All GI Alliance" option is a checkbox. It's not clear whether a patient at Granite Peaks GI should write "Granite Peaks GI" in the Provider field or check "All GI Alliance."

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Garbled text layer**: The PDF's text layer is completely non-functional — all extracted text is control characters and numeric gibberish (e.g., `\u0012\u000e\u000e\u0013\u0014811\u0015\u0016\u001732`). This renders the document inaccessible to screen readers, search engines, and text-selection tools. The Type 3 font encoding from the PDFCreator/Ghostscript print-to-PDF process is fundamentally broken.
- **Browser print artifacts**: The document retains browser timestamps ("1/30/25, 1:50 PM"), "Printed on 1/30/2025" headers, the gGastro application URL (`https://az-039-c.ggastrocloud.com/gGastro/?status=Logout&message=`) in the footer, and browser-generated page numbers. These artifacts indicate this was a casual browser print rather than a properly prepared document, and they expose internal EHR system URLs.
- **Blank revocation address**: The revocation notification address is a fill-in blank with no pre-populated information. If a patient needs to revoke their authorization, they have no guidance on where to send the revocation letter.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular record-type selection**: The form offers 10 specific record type checkboxes (All Records, Abstract Record, Medication Records, Laboratory/Pathology Reports, Radiology Reports, Verbal Communication Only, Office/Progress Notes, Operative Notes, Itemized Billing Statements, Other), giving patients meaningful control over exactly what information is released.
- **Delivery method choice**: The form includes E-Delivery as an option alongside Mail, at least acknowledging electronic delivery as a possibility.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: The form properly separates sensitive categories (HIV/AIDS, Drug/Alcohol Use, Genetic Testing, Mental Health/Developmental Disabilities) with individual checkbox opt-ins and an explanatory paragraph, rather than bundling them with general authorization.
