# Evaluation: St. Charles Redmond — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-2 is a 2-page "AUTHORIZATION FOR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION" — a general-purpose ROI authorization form used across the entire St. Charles Health System. The form number is **3740**, with a footer date of **11/19** (November 2019 template revision), though the filename ("3740AuthorizedRecordReleaseFILLABLE-102022.pdf") indicates the fillable PDF version was created in October 2022.

This is **one of four forms** retrieved for St. Charles Redmond:
- **form-1.pdf**: The older 2016 non-fillable version of the same form (form 3740, dated 4/16). No fillable fields.
- **form-2.pdf** (this document): The 2022 fillable version, based on the 11/19 template revision.
- **form-3.pdf**: The current 2025 version (3740, dated 1/25), now linked from the website. Adds the "Center for Orthopedics and Neurosurgery" location and updates format/delivery options.
- **form-4.pdf**: The current 2025 Spanish-language version (form 3742, dated 2/25).

Form-2 is a **superseded version** — it is no longer linked from the current release-of-information page, having been replaced by form-3 (2025 English) and form-4 (2025 Spanish). It represents an intermediate revision between the 2016 original and the current form.

The form is system-wide: it covers St. Charles Bend, Redmond, Madras, Prineville, and Sage View with location checkboxes, meaning there is no Redmond-specific form.

## 2. FINDABILITY

According to retrieval notes, the form was **easy to find**. The first web search for authorization/release/health information immediately surfaced the St. Charles release-of-information page and direct PDF links. The canonical page at `https://stcharleshealthcare.org/patients/release-information` is clearly linked and well-organized.

However, form-2 specifically is a **legacy document** — it was found via search results pointing to older URLs, not from the current website navigation. The source URL (`/sites/default/files/Documents/ROI/3740AuthorizedRecordReleaseFILLABLE-102022.pdf`) remains accessible but is no longer linked from the current ROI page. Patients navigating the website today would find form-3 instead, which is the updated 2025 version.

The filename is reasonably descriptive: "3740AuthorizedRecordReleaseFILLABLE-102022" communicates the form number, purpose, fillable status, and date — though it's not particularly patient-friendly.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (7,466 characters), enabling search, copy/paste, and screen reader access.

**Fillable fields**: The form has **64 fillable form fields** — a strong count for a 2-page document. This indicates a genuinely interactive PDF where patients can type responses directly. Field names are not populated in the metadata (empty array), which may indicate generic field naming in the PDF structure.

**File format**: 379,816 bytes (380 KB) for 2 pages, with 17 fonts and 2 embedded images. The file size is moderate — the images and font embedding explain the larger-than-text-only size. This is not a scanned document; it was created digitally ("Pacific Office Automation" appears in the footer, indicating professional form design software).

**Digital-first design**: This is a **digitally-designed fillable PDF**, not a scan. The 64 interactive fields, clean text layer, and professional layout confirm it was built for digital completion. However, the signature requirement ("MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED") undermines the digital workflow — a patient can fill out the form electronically but must print it to sign.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages, which is appropriate for an ROI authorization. The form fits the content without feeling cramped or padded.

**Organization**: The form uses a **numbered section system** (1–10) with corresponding numbered instructions at the bottom of each page. Sections flow logically:
1. Patient demographics
2. Purpose of request
3–4. Sender/recipient identification (From/To with location checkboxes)
5. Date range of services
6. Record types to release
7. Sensitive information initials (page 2)
8. Format options
9. Signature
10. Office use

**Clarity**: The language is generally accessible, though it leans toward institutional/legal phrasing. The instruction block uses plain language: *"Select the purpose of your request: legal, insurance, personal, continuation of care, or other (please specify)."* The rights section uses parenthetical clarifications: *"I have the right to revoke (take back or change my mind about) this authorization at any time."*

**Layout complexity**: The From/To section (areas 3–4) is potentially confusing. The form uses dual columns with checkboxes for both "From" and "To" appearing twice, and the instruction text for items 3 and 4 is **identical**: *"Check with the 'From' or 'To' box, then identify and provide the contact information for the sender or recipient of the medical records, as applicable."* This could confuse patients about which side represents what.

**Record type options**: Section 6 offers specific categories (Visit Summary, ER Record, Lab, Radiology, Cardiac Tests, Billing) plus "Any & All Records" and an "Other" write-in. There is a separate checkbox and detailed instructions for authorizing radiology film release through Central Oregon Radiology Associates (CORA), adding complexity.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a **general-purpose authorization form** — it handles both patient access requests and third-party releases through the same From/To checkbox mechanism. There is no dedicated patient-access pathway. The form states: *"This form can be used for records of St. Charles Health System or records of other health care providers"*, meaning it also functions as an incoming records request form.

**Scope options**: Good granularity. Patients can specify:
- Date range of services
- Specific record types (6 categories plus "Other")
- Specific St. Charles locations
- Sensitive record types requiring separate initials (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, genetic)

**Format options**: Limited. Section 8 offers only **Paper** and **CD**: *"Records Format (paper is the default if not marked): Paper / CD."* No electronic delivery (email, patient portal, secure link). No fax option for patients (fax noted elsewhere as restricted to provider-to-provider).

**Delivery options**: Only **U.S. Mail** and **Pick up**. No electronic delivery mechanism.

**Right of Access language**: The form does **not** reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access. It references federal/state regulations only in the context of copy fees: *"Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations."*

**EHI Export awareness**: No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or bulk data access.

**Purpose options**: The form offers "Legal / Insurance / Personal / Continuation of Care / Other" — the "Personal" option serves as the closest proxy for a patient self-access request.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Wet-ink signature requirement**: The form explicitly states **"MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED"** next to the signature line (section 9). This effectively prevents fully electronic submission and requires printing, signing, and physical delivery (mail or in-person). This is a notable barrier to digital access.

**Photo ID check**: The office-use section includes a *"Photo ID checked"* checkbox, suggesting in-person identity verification is expected or at least standard practice.

**Copy fees**: The form states twice that *"Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations"* but does not specify amounts. This is appropriately vague — it defers to the regulatory framework rather than setting its own fee schedule.

**Expiration**: *"Unless I revoke this authorization, it will expire on the following date or event: ______. If an expiration date is not specified, this authorization will expire one year from the date it is signed."* A one-year default expiration is reasonable and standard.

**No treatment conditioning**: The form correctly states: *"No determination about treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits will be based on whether or not I sign this authorization form."*

**Re-disclosure warning**: Includes appropriate language: *"I understand that federal confidentiality rules will not protect the medical information that I have authorized to be released, if it is released again by the organization or person that receives it."*

**Minor consent protections**: Instructions note Oregon-specific minor consent rules: *"No drug and alcohol treatment records of a minor who is 14 years old or older, nor medical records of any type of a minor who is 15 years old or older, may be released without the minor's written authorization if the minor is self-consented to the treatment associated with the records."*

**Rejection right**: *"St. Charles reserves the right to reject this authorization form if the legal authority of the representative cannot be validated."*

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Wet-ink signature mandate**: The form requires "MUST BE WET-INK SIGNED" — this prevents fully electronic submission and creates a significant barrier for patients who want to complete the entire process digitally. HIPAA does not require wet-ink signatures for patient access requests; electronic signatures are permissible.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Identical instructions for sections 3 and 4**: Instructions 3 and 4 both read identically — *"Check with the 'From' or 'To' box, then identify and provide the contact information for the sender or recipient of the medical records, as applicable."* The dual From/To layout with two identical instruction items is confusing and could lead patients to fill out the form incorrectly.
- **"Faxes are only sent to other healthcare providers offices"**: This note appears in the form body but fax is not listed as a delivery option in section 8 (only U.S. Mail and Pick up). The relationship between fax capability and the delivery options section is unclear.
- **Fee ambiguity**: The form references "Standard copy fees" twice without specifying amounts or pointing patients to a fee schedule. Patients have no way to anticipate costs before submitting.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Form revision date mismatch**: The footer reads "3740 11/19" (November 2019), but the filename indicates "102022" (October 2022). This creates confusion about which version the patient is actually using — the template design date vs. the fillable conversion date are conflated.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **64 fillable fields**: The form has a robust set of interactive fields, making digital completion (short of signature) straightforward. This is significantly better than the flat-PDF predecessor (form-1, which had 0 fillable fields).
- **Sensitive record granularity**: Requiring separate initials for substance abuse, HIV, mental health, and genetic records provides meaningful patient control over especially sensitive categories, going beyond minimum requirements.
- **Numbered instruction system**: Each form section (1–10) has a corresponding numbered instruction, making the form more self-explanatory than typical ROI forms.
- **System-wide form with location checkboxes**: A single form covering all St. Charles locations simplifies the process for patients who received care at multiple facilities.
