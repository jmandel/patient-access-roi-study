# Evaluation: Fenway Health — form-2.pdf (ROI Form FAQ Sheet)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is **not** an ROI authorization form itself. It is a 3-page companion document titled "ROI Form FAQ Sheet" that walks patients through each section of the actual ROI form (form-1.pdf). The document mirrors the numbered structure of the authorization form (sections 1–7) and explains in plain language what each field means, what options are available, and why each section matters.

Fenway Health's document set consists of three files: form-1.pdf (the English ROI authorization form), this FAQ sheet (form-2.pdf), and form-3.pdf (a Spanish-language translation of form-1). The FAQ sheet serves as a bridge document — it doesn't collect any data itself but helps patients complete the actual form correctly.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, the FAQ sheet was discovered alongside the main ROI form through a site-scoped web search (`site:fenwayhealth.org authorization release medical records`). It is hosted at a publicly accessible URL (`fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ReleaseofInformationFAQSheet.pdf`) and was surfaced within the first couple of search attempts. The filename "ReleaseofInformationFAQSheet.pdf" is descriptive and self-explanatory. Fenway Health's dedicated medical records page (https://fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/) appears to link to both the form and this FAQ sheet, making the companion document readily discoverable alongside the form it supports.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present. The full text (5,411 characters) is fully extractable.
- **Fillable fields:** None (0 fields), which is appropriate — this is a reference document, not a form.
- **File size:** 87,588 bytes (86 KB) for 3 pages, which is very lean.
- **Embedded images:** 0. The document is text-only.
- **Font count:** 4 fonts used.
- **Digital-first design:** Yes. This was clearly created digitally (not scanned). The clean text layer, small file size, zero images, and low font count all indicate a straightforward word-processor-to-PDF workflow.

The document is technically well-constructed for its purpose: lightweight, fully text-searchable, and easy to print or read on screen.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 3 pages for a 7-section walkthrough is proportionate. At ~5,400 characters, it's concise enough to read in a few minutes without being so brief that it omits useful detail.

**Clarity:** The language is conversational and accessible. Phrases like "This is pretty self-explanatory" (section 1a) and "more opportunities for all involved health centers to fully confirm the patient's identity" (section 1b.i) use everyday language. The document avoids legal jargon almost entirely.

**Organization:** The FAQ sheet follows the exact same numbered structure (1–7) as the authorization form, making it easy to cross-reference. Each section has sub-points (a, b, c...) with further detail under roman numerals (i, ii, iii...). This hierarchical structure is logical and mirrors the form it supports.

**Specific explanations are valuable:** The document defines each "Reason for Release" option with clear descriptions. For example, it explains that "Bi-Directional" means "This will only allow Fenway Health to be able to communicate with the other health center regarding the patient. NO RECORDS WILL BE SENT IF THIS IS SELECTED." It clarifies that "Abstract" means "the last 2 years of office visits, labs, immunizations, diagnostics & radiology reports." These definitions go well beyond what the form itself provides.

**Practical details included:** The FAQ sheet embeds Fenway Health's contact information for cases where the patient is sending records *to* Fenway: "Fenway Health / 1340 Boylston St. / Boston, MA 02215 / Phone: 617-927-6191 / Fax: 617-425-5713." This saves patients a lookup step.

**Processing time guidance:** The document states "It could take up to 21 days for a records request to be fully processed" and notes that legal and insurance requests "usually have hard deadlines" and are prioritized accordingly.

**Weakness — visual design:** With 0 embedded images and only 4 fonts, the document appears to be a plain-text outline with minimal visual formatting. There are no headers with visual distinction, no boxes, no color, and no graphical elements. While the content is clear, the visual presentation is utilitarian.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Helpful for patient-initiated requests:** The FAQ sheet does not distinguish between patient-access requests and third-party releases — it follows the same form structure. However, several of the "Reason for Release" explanations (transfer care, share records with another provider) are clearly patient-initiated scenarios.

**Sensitive information guidance:** The FAQ sheet lists all sensitive information categories (abortion care, gender-affirming care, alcohol/substance use treatment, behavioral health, genetic testing, sexual health information including HIV/AIDS, intimate partner violence counseling, STDs, and sexual violence counseling) and emphasizes: "This section needs to be filled out completely. If not handled correctly, inappropriate sharing of medical records can become a serious issue." This is a strong patient-protection message.

**Authorization validity:** Notes that "These ROI forms are good for 1 year" (section 7a.i), which matches the legal notice in the actual form.

**Gap — no mention of electronic delivery or patient portal:** The FAQ sheet does not mention MyChart or electronic submission options, even though the retrieval notes indicate these exist. It also doesn't mention that patients can request records in electronic format, which is a HIPAA right.

**Gap — no mention of fees:** The document says nothing about whether records requests incur a cost, which would be helpful context for patients.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

This document does not impose any requirements itself — it is purely instructional. However, some of its guidance reflects compliance-relevant features of the underlying form:

- **One-year authorization validity:** Described as standard ("good for 1 year"), which is a common and reasonable timeframe.
- **21-day processing time:** Stated as maximum. HIPAA requires response within 30 days (extendable to 60), so 21 days is within bounds, though it may be longer than patients expect.
- **Sensitive information initialing requirement:** The FAQ sheet explains the requirement to initial each sensitive information category individually, which aligns with Massachusetts and federal law (42 CFR Part 2 for substance abuse records).
- **No mention of patient right to revoke:** The FAQ sheet omits this, though it is covered in the form's legal notice section.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Companion FAQ guide exists at all.** Very few healthcare organizations create a separate instructional document to walk patients through their ROI form. This is an unusually patient-friendly practice.
- **Plain-language definitions of form options.** The explanations of "Bi-Directional," "Abstract," and other options that would otherwise be opaque to patients are genuinely helpful. The clarification that bi-directional communication means "NO RECORDS WILL BE SENT" is important information that many patients would otherwise miss.
- **Sensitive information categories explicitly listed and explained.** Including gender-affirming care and abortion care as named categories (alongside the more traditional behavioral health, HIV/AIDS, and substance use categories) reflects Fenway Health's awareness of its patient population's needs.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Tone inconsistency regarding audience.** The FAQ sheet alternates between addressing patients directly ("Patients will need to fully complete this section") and addressing staff or intermediaries ("we need to know exactly where to send this request to," "we generally prioritize taking care of LEGAL and INSURANCE requests"). This creates ambiguity about who the intended reader is — a patient trying to fill out the form, or staff helping a patient.
- **No mention of electronic delivery options.** Despite Fenway Health offering MyChart and email submission, the FAQ sheet doesn't mention these, potentially leading patients to think fax and mail are the only options.
