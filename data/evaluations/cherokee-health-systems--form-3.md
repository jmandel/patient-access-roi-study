# Evaluation: Cherokee Health Systems — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3.pdf is a **color-coded instructional version** of River Valley Health's (formerly Cherokee Health Systems) "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Health Records" form. The source filename is `12.19.25 Color Coated Release of Information .pdf`. It is a single-page document (135,599 bytes) that overlays the same ROI authorization form found in form-1.pdf (the standard English version) with colored annotation callouts explaining how to complete each section.

This is one of four documents published on River Valley Health's Medical Records page:
- **form-1.pdf**: Standard English ROI form (the operative form for submission)
- **form-2.pdf**: Standard Spanish ROI form
- **form-3.pdf** *(this document)*: English color-coded instructional guide
- **form-4.pdf**: Spanish color-coded instructional guide

Form-3 is not intended to be submitted as an authorization itself — it is a companion guide. It contains the same legal text, field structure, and layout as form-1, but adds instructional annotations like "Enter your personal information in this section," "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider," "You are authorizing River Valley Health to send your medical records to this healthcare provider," and "Remember to sign and date."

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was easily discoverable. According to retrieval notes, a web search for `Cherokee Health Systems Knoxville TN "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` immediately surfaced the Medical Records page at https://www.rvh.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/. The page is accessible from the main website navigation under Patients & Visitors → Medical Records. All four PDFs are listed with clear labels and download links.

The URL path for this specific document (`/app/files/public/71d25e7f.../12.19.25 Color Coated Release of Information .pdf`) is somewhat opaque — it uses a GUID and a filename with a date prefix, but the filename does contain descriptive text ("Color Coated Release of Information"). The misspelling "Coated" (likely intended to be "Coded") is a minor issue in the URL/filename but does not meaningfully impair discoverability since the linking page labels the document clearly.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present. The document has extractable text (3,126 characters), though the extraction order is imperfect due to the overlay annotations. For example, the text extraction produces "You\nZip: are authorizing River Valley" — the annotation text interleaves with form field labels, suggesting the color-coded annotations are positioned as floating text boxes overlapping the base form layout.

**Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). The PDF contains no interactive form fields — it is a static, non-fillable document. This is less concerning for the instructional guide (which is not meant to be filled out) but indicates the underlying form design is print-oriented.

**File format and structure**: The document has 8 fonts and 29 embedded images, which is high for a single-page form. This suggests the color-coded annotations may use image-based elements (colored boxes, arrows) rather than native PDF annotations. The file size (135 KB) is reasonable.

**Digital-first design**: This is not a scanned document, but it is clearly designed for print. The annotations are meant to help someone understand what to fill in on a paper copy. There is no electronic submission workflow built into the document itself, though the organization's Medical Records page indicates forms can be emailed to registration@rvh.org.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page, which is appropriate for an instructional overlay. It fits all annotations alongside the full form content.

**Clarity of annotations**: The instructional callouts use plain, simple language:
- "Enter your personal information in this section."
- "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider."
- "You are authorizing River Valley Health to send your medical records to this healthcare provider."
- "Remember to sign and date."

These are genuinely helpful — they translate the form's bureaucratic section headers ("Record Requested to be Sent From" / "Record to be Sent To") into plain-language explanations of what the patient is actually doing.

**Legal text density**: The form still carries a dense block of legal text (the asterisked paragraph about sensitive records including HIV, AIDS, hepatitis, substance use disorder protections under 42 C.F.R. Part 2 and HIPAA 45 C.F.R. pts 160 & 164). This paragraph is not annotated or explained in the instructional version — it is presented identically to form-1. This is a missed opportunity; the instructional version could have included a plain-language summary of this paragraph.

**Signature/certification block**: The certification language is dense and legalistic, listing six categories of authorized signers with complex age-threshold rules (16 for behavioral health, 18 for medical records). This block is also unannotated beyond the simple "Remember to sign and date."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is titled "Authorization to Release and/or Obtain Health Records" and functions as a general bidirectional authorization — it can be used to send records from River Valley Health to another provider, or to request records from another provider be sent to River Valley Health. There is no distinct form for a patient requesting their own records directly. "Personal Use" is listed as one of six purpose options, but the form structure (with "Record Requested to be Sent From" and "Record to be Sent To" facility sections) assumes an inter-facility transfer model.

**Scope options**: The form offers four record type checkboxes — Medical Records, Behavioral Health Records, Substance Use Disorder Treatment Records, and Other (Please Specify). A date range field ("From" / "To") is included. This provides reasonable granularity.

**Purpose options**: Six choices — Personal Use, Legal, Disability, Coordination of Care, Transfer of Care, Other. "Personal Use" is the relevant option for patient access requests.

**Format/delivery options**: None specified on the form. There is no checkbox for electronic delivery, email, portal access, or format preferences (paper vs. electronic). The notes indicate forms can be emailed to registration@rvh.org, but this is about submitting the authorization — not about how records will be delivered.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 (patient Right of Access) or explain patient rights. There is no mention of electronic health information export or bulk data.

**Instructional value**: The color-coded annotations are specifically designed to reduce confusion, which is a patient-friendly design choice. However, the annotations are relatively superficial — they explain which section is which but don't address common patient questions like "What if I want my records sent to me?" or "How long will this take?"

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization validity**: The form states "this authorization is valid for 12 months from the date of signature," which is a reasonable duration.

**Revocation rights**: The form notes patients "may cancel this request by written notification signed by me, but that it will not affect any information released prior to written notification of cancellation." This is appropriate.

**Age requirements**: The form specifies age 16 for behavioral health/substance use disorder records and age 18 for medical records, which aligns with Tennessee state law (T.C.A. § 33-3-104 for behavioral health).

**No fee disclosure**: The form does not mention any fees for record copies. This is neutral — no upfront fee barrier is imposed, but patients are also not informed of their right to receive copies at a reasonable cost-based fee.

**No submission method restrictions**: The form itself does not restrict submission to in-person only. The broader Medical Records page indicates email submission is accepted.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Instructional companion document**: The existence of a color-coded "How To Complete the Form" guide is uncommon and genuinely helpful. Most organizations provide only the bare authorization form. Publishing this alongside the standard form shows an intentional effort to reduce patient confusion.
- **Bilingual documentation**: Providing both the form and the instructional guide in English and Spanish (four documents total) demonstrates meaningful commitment to language accessibility.
- **Plain-language annotations**: Phrases like "You are authorizing River Valley Health to obtain records from the following healthcare provider" successfully translate bureaucratic form labels into understandable instructions.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Instructional vs. submittable**: It is not explicitly stated on form-3 itself that this is a guide and not the form to submit. A patient could potentially fill out and submit the annotated version, which would work but might confuse staff processing it.
- **"Record Requested to be Sent From" vs. "Record to be Sent To"**: Even with annotations, the bidirectional form structure may confuse patients who simply want a copy of their own records. The annotations explain who is sending/receiving, but a patient who just wants their records sent to themselves (not to another facility) may not know what to put in either facility section.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Filename misspelling**: The source PDF is named "Color Coated Release of Information" — this should be "Color Coded." This appears in the URL and potentially on the download page.
- **Text extraction interleaving**: The annotation overlays cause garbled text extraction (e.g., "You\nZip: are authorizing River Valley"), indicating the annotation text boxes overlap form field labels in the PDF structure. This degrades accessibility for screen readers and automated text processing.
