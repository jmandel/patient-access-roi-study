## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **generic Medical Records Release Authorization form published by HealthMark Group**, the third-party medical records management vendor that HopeHealth uses for records requests. It is **not branded to HopeHealth** in any way — the form contains no HopeHealth name, logo, or address. The only organizational identifier is the submission instruction at the bottom: "Please send signed Authorization to: HealthMark Group: Requestor Support Team / status@healthmark-group.com / (800) 659-4035 Ext. 2."

This form was **not linked from the HopeHealth website**. It was found independently on HealthMark's parent company website (hmutx.com). HopeHealth's medical records page (https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/) directs patients exclusively to HealthMark's online Request Manager portal, not to this PDF.

The other document found for HopeHealth (form-1.pdf) is a Notice of Privacy Practices — a privacy notice, not an authorization form. This means **no HopeHealth-specific ROI form exists as a publicly downloadable PDF**. This generic HealthMark form is the closest available analog to what a patient might encounter when navigating the HealthMark portal.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Findability is very poor.** This form is essentially undiscoverable by a HopeHealth patient through normal means:

- It is **not linked from HopeHealth's website** at all. The medical records page directs patients to the HealthMark Request Manager portal (https://requestmanager.healthmark-group.com/register), which requires email verification to access.
- The form was found on a **different website** (hmutx.com), which is HealthMark's parent company site — not somewhere a patient would think to look.
- **Multiple web search strategies failed** to locate a HopeHealth-specific form. Searches for `"HopeHealth" "authorization" "release" filetype:pdf` and `site:hope-health.org authorization release medical records` yielded no relevant results.
- The **Wayback Machine** confirmed that HopeHealth has used the HealthMark portal approach since at least 2020, with no earlier downloadable form available.
- Search results were further complicated by **name confusion** with Hope Health Ellis County, TX (a different organization), producing false leads via JotForm.

A patient wanting to download, print, and submit an authorization form would have no clear path to do so from HopeHealth's website. The only pathway is through the HealthMark portal, which is gated behind email verification.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**As a PDF artifact, the form is technically adequate but limited:**

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (2,599 characters). This is a digitally-created PDF, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite being a digital PDF, there are **no interactive form fields** at all. The form contains labeled blanks (Person/Company, Address, City, State, Phone, Fax, Zip, Patient Name, Phone, Date of Birth, Email address, Date, Signature) that a patient would need to either print and handwrite or use PDF annotation tools to complete.
- **File size:** 49 KB for a single page — reasonable and lightweight.
- **Fonts:** 4 fonts embedded.
- **Images:** Zero embedded images — no logos, no branding.
- **Design origin:** This appears to be a natively digital document (not a scan), making the absence of fillable fields a missed opportunity.

The form lacks checkbox interactivity as well. Items like "Please provide a complete copy of my file for all dates of service" and the records-type selections (All Medical Records, History & Physical, Operative Report, etc.) are presented with "o" characters as visual bullet/checkbox markers rather than actual interactive checkboxes. A patient filling this digitally would have no way to "check" these boxes without manual annotation.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**The form is concise but dense, cramming substantial content onto a single page.**

**Structure:** The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow:
1. Recipient information ("To Recipient")
2. Source/patient information ("From Clinic/Hospital" / "Patient")
3. Dates of service selection
4. Records type selection
5. Purpose for disclosure
6. HIPAA acknowledgment checkboxes
7. Signature block
8. Submission instructions

**Language quality:** The form mixes plain-language instructions with HIPAA regulatory citations. The acknowledgment section is notably dense, with sentences like: "I understand that my records are confidential and cannot be disclosed without my written authorization except when otherwise permitted by law. Information used or disclosed pursuant to this authorization may be subject to redisclosure by the recipient and no longer protected." This is standard legal language, but not particularly patient-friendly.

The form **cites specific CFR sections inline** — e.g., "(45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(i))" after "Records to be Released" and "(45 CFR § 164.508(c)(2)(i))" after the revocation acknowledgment. While legally thorough, this is not how patients naturally read or understand their rights.

**Scope of records options:** The form provides 11 record type checkboxes: All Medical Records (no films), History & Physical, Consultation Reports, Emergency Room Record, Operative Report, Discharge Summary, Lab/Pathology Reports, Radiology Reports, Images (check for CD of films), Itemized Billing, and Other. This is a reasonably comprehensive selection.

**Purpose options:** Six purpose checkboxes: Disability, Insurance, Attorney, Referring Physician, Patient Request, Other. The inclusion of "Patient Request" is appropriate for patient-access scenarios.

**Layout:** Everything fits on one page, which is efficient but results in tight spacing. The form uses horizontal lines for fill-in fields and "o" characters for checkboxes, giving it a somewhat dated, typewriter-era appearance.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**This form is a general-purpose release authorization, not designed specifically for patient access requests.**

- **Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form's structure is oriented toward third-party disclosure. The opening line reads: "Upon presentation of this authorization you are requested to provide the records outlined below to: To Recipient:" — implying records are being released to a third party. A patient requesting their own records would need to list themselves as the "Recipient," which, while possible, is not intuitive. "Patient Request" is listed as one of six purpose options, but it's not the default or primary use case.
- **"From Clinic/Hospital" field:** This is a generic field — the patient must fill in which facility they're requesting records from. This makes sense for a vendor like HealthMark that serves many facilities, but a HopeHealth-branded form would have this pre-filled.
- **Format/delivery options:** The form provides **no options for delivery format**. There is no checkbox for electronic delivery, email, CD, portal access, or mail. The form doesn't specify how the patient will receive their records at all.
- **Date range options:** The form offers two date-of-service options — complete file for all dates, or a specified date range — which gives patients reasonable control.
- **HIPAA Right of Access:** The form does not explicitly mention the patient's right of access under 45 CFR § 164.524. The HIPAA citations present (§ 164.508) relate to the authorization requirements for disclosure, not to the patient access right. This is an important distinction — § 164.508 governs authorizations for uses and disclosures, while § 164.524 governs the patient's right to access their own records.
- **EHI Export:** No mention of electronic health information export, TEFCA, or any modern interoperability concepts.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Expiration:** The authorization expires "One Hundred Eighty (180) days from the date of my signature." This is a fixed, non-patient-configurable expiration. 180 days (approximately 6 months) is a moderate timeframe — not unreasonably short, but the patient cannot extend it or set their own expiration.
- **Revocation:** The form includes a standard revocation acknowledgment: "I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time except to the extent that action has been taken in reliance upon this authorization." This is HIPAA-compliant language.
- **Conditioning of treatment:** The form includes a correct statement that "treatment or payment cannot be conditioned on my signing this authorization" with appropriate exceptions noted (research, pre-employment testing). This aligns with 45 CFR § 164.508(c)(2)(ii).
- **Sensitive information disclosure:** The form includes a blanket acknowledgment regarding "history, diagnosis, and/or treatment of drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness, or communicable disease, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)." This is appropriate HIPAA language but may not satisfy stricter state-level consent requirements (e.g., 42 CFR Part 2 for substance use disorder records, which historically required separate consent).
- **Submission method:** The form directs submission to "HealthMark Group: Requestor Support Team" via email (status@healthmark-group.com) or phone ((800) 659-4035 Ext. 2). No mention of fax, mail, or in-person submission alternatives. Email submission of a signed form is convenient but raises questions about how signature authentication works in practice.
- **Fees:** No fee information is disclosed on the form.
- **No notarization or witness requirement** — the form requires only the patient's (or authorized representative's) signature and printed name.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No HopeHealth-specific form exists publicly.** A patient visiting HopeHealth's website cannot download an authorization form. The only pathway is through HealthMark's email-gated portal. This creates a significant accessibility barrier — patients without email, those uncomfortable with online portals, or those who simply want to print and fill out a form have no clear path forward from the HopeHealth website.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Unclear applicability to HopeHealth.** This form is a generic HealthMark document not linked from HopeHealth's site. It's unknown whether HopeHealth would actually accept this form if a patient printed it, filled it out, and submitted it directly. The form has a blank "From Clinic/Hospital" field, suggesting it could be used for any HealthMark client, but the actual workflow HopeHealth expects is via the online portal.
- **No delivery format specified.** The form collects what records to release and to whom, but provides no mechanism for the patient to indicate how they want to receive the records (paper, CD, electronic, portal, etc.).
- **"Patient Request" purpose is ambiguous.** Listing "Patient Request" as one of six purpose checkboxes alongside "Attorney," "Insurance," and "Referring Physician" doesn't distinguish between a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access (which has specific legal protections around timing and fees) and a general disclosure request.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Wrong HIPAA section for patient access.** The form cites 45 CFR § 164.508 throughout, which governs authorizations for uses and disclosures. For a patient requesting their own records, the operative provision is 45 CFR § 164.524 (Right of Access). In fact, a patient exercising their Right of Access under § 164.524 does not technically need to sign a § 164.508 authorization at all — the right of access is a separate legal mechanism. Treating patient access requests as § 164.508 authorizations may result in patients being subjected to requirements (like the 180-day expiration) that don't apply under the Right of Access framework.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular record-type selection.** The form offers 11 specific record categories plus an "Other" option, giving patients meaningful control over what information is released rather than forcing an all-or-nothing disclosure.
- **Inline regulatory citations.** While dense, the form's practice of citing specific CFR sections next to each acknowledgment statement provides transparency about the legal basis for each requirement.
