## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a single-page Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information — a standard Release of Information (ROI) form. It is Fenway Health's primary English-language form for authorizing the release of medical records.

**Relationship to other documents found:**
- **form-2.pdf** is a 3-page companion FAQ sheet ("ROI Form FAQ Sheet") that walks patients through each section of this form. It is not itself an ROI form.
- **form-3.pdf** is a Spanish-language translation of this same form ("Autorización de Fenway Health Para Divulgar Información De Salud Protegida"), with identical structure.

Form-1 is the core document a patient would complete. The FAQ sheet (form-2) serves as supplementary guidance, and form-3 provides language accessibility. Together they represent a cohesive records-release package.

The form is a **general-purpose authorization** — it covers disclosure FROM one facility TO another. It is not specifically designed for patient self-access (i.e., a patient requesting records be sent to themselves). The FROM/TO structure ("I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM: Sender/Facility's name... TO: Recipient/Facility's name") frames the interaction as a provider-to-provider transfer rather than a patient-directed access request.

## 2. FINDABILITY

According to retrieval notes, finding this form was straightforward. The second web search (`"Fenway Health" Boston "medical records" "release form" OR "authorization form"`) immediately returned both the direct PDF URL and the dedicated medical records landing page at https://fenwayhealth.org/medical-records/. No bot-blocking or access barriers were encountered.

The URL itself is descriptive: `FHROIForm10202025.pdf` — indicating the organization, document type, and date (October 20, 2025). The file lives in a standard WordPress uploads directory (`/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/`).

Fenway Health maintains a dedicated medical records page with clear instructions for submitting the form via fax, email, or mail, and also offers MyChart patient portal submission. The form was found within one search query — a best-case scenario for findability.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present. The form has extractable text (3,259 characters), confirming it was digitally created rather than scanned. All content is machine-readable and searchable.

**Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite being a digital-origin PDF, the form contains no interactive form fields. A patient must print it, fill it by hand, and then scan/fax/mail it back. This is a significant missed opportunity — the form was clearly designed in a layout tool (7 fonts, 5 embedded images, clean structure), but was exported as a flat PDF without interactive fields.

**File size:** 205 KB for a single page is moderately heavy, likely due to the 5 embedded images (presumably a logo and decorative elements). Not problematic but larger than necessary for a text-dominant one-page form.

**Format:** PDF, digitally created. The clean text extraction confirms there are no OCR issues. Font variety (7 fonts) suggests intentional typography and visual design.

**Digital workflow:** The form footer provides multiple submission channels: mail, fax (617-425-5713), and email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org). The notes also mention MyChart portal submission. However, the form itself cannot be completed digitally since it lacks fillable fields — a patient would need to print, hand-fill, and then digitize again for electronic submission.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and density:** The form fits on a single page, which is concise. It packs seven numbered sections into that page, suggesting the layout is somewhat dense but not unreasonably so.

**Organization:** The seven sections follow a logical flow:
1. Patient Information
2. Release FROM (sender)
3. Release TO (recipient)
4. Reason for Release
5. Type of Information to Disclose
6. Sensitive Information
7. Legal Notice and Patient Signature

This is well-sequenced — identity first, then the transfer parties, then what/why, then sensitive categories, then legal/signature.

**Language clarity:** The form uses generally clear language. Section headers like "I give permission to release my protected health information and medical records FROM:" are patient-friendly. However, the legal notice in Section 7 is a single dense paragraph running approximately 130 words without line breaks, mixing multiple legal concepts: authorization scope, revocation rights, reproductive health care protections, 42 CFR Part 2 substance abuse protections, and the consent acknowledgment. This paragraph would benefit from being broken into separate, shorter statements.

**Section 6 (Sensitive Information):** This section includes a bold instruction: "**COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING**". It lists 10 categories of sensitive information, each requiring patient initials, plus an opt-out option ("I would NOT like any sensitive information disclosed"). The categories include:

- Abortion Care
- Genetic Testing
- Sexual Violence Counseling
- Intimate Partner Violence Counseling
- Behavioral Health Information written by medical provider
- Behavioral Health Information written by psychiatrist, therapist, mental health clinician or social worker
- Alcohol/Substance Use Treatment
- HIV/AIDS Results or Related Care
- Sexually Transmitted Diseases
- "I would NOT like any sensitive information disclosed" (opt-out)

This is a granular and thoughtful set of categories, reflecting both federal (42 CFR Part 2) and Massachusetts state privacy protections.

**Reason for Release options (Section 4):** Offers six choices including a notable "bi-directional communication" option that explicitly states "NO RECORDS WILL BE SENT/RECEIVED — Will ONLY allow bi-directional communication with service providers." This is an unusual but useful distinction.

**Type of Information options (Section 5):** Offers six choices: All Records, Abstract (defined as "2 years of office visits, labs, immunizations, diagnostics and radiology reports"), date-range treatment, Optometry Records, Dental Records, and Other.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This form is designed as a general disclosure authorization, not specifically for patient self-access. The FROM/TO structure asks for "Sender/Facility's name" and "Recipient/Facility's name," implying facility-to-facility transfer. A patient wanting records sent to themselves would need to write their own name and home address in the "Recipient/Facility's name" field — which is unintuitive. There is no checkbox or option for "send records to me, the patient."

**Scope options:** Good. Patients can select from predefined record types (All Records, Abstract, date range, Optometry, Dental, Other) and can granularly control which sensitive information categories are included via the initials-based Section 6.

**Format/delivery options:** The form itself does not ask patients to specify their preferred delivery format (paper, CD, electronic). The footer provides submission channels for the form (mail, fax, email), but these are channels for *submitting the authorization*, not for receiving the records. There is no mention of electronic delivery of records, EHI export, or patient portal access for record retrieval.

**Rights language:** The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) or explain patient rights. The legal notice mentions revocation rights and 42 CFR Part 2 protections but does not educate the patient about their broader right to access their own records.

**Companion FAQ sheet:** While not part of form-1 itself, the existence of form-2 (FAQ sheet) significantly improves the overall patient experience. The FAQ explains each section in plain language, defines terms like "bi-directional," and notes that processing may take up to 21 days. This companion document demonstrates patient-centered thinking, even if the form itself is somewhat clinical.

**Multilingual access:** The availability of a Spanish-language version (form-3) is a positive indicator of accessibility efforts.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization scope:** "This authorization is valid for this request only and will not be honored for any subsequent requests." This is clear and appropriately limited.

**Expiration:** "This authorization for disclosure (unless expressly revoked earlier) will remain valid for one year from the date signed below." One year is a reasonable expiration period — not so short as to create inconvenience, not so long as to raise privacy concerns.

**Revocation rights:** "I understand that I may revoke this authorization at any time by making a request in writing to the Privacy Officer of Fenway Health." This is clearly stated.

**Reproductive and gender-affirming care protections:** The form includes a notable attestation: "By signing below, I affirm that the medical records requested are not being sought for the purpose of investigating, initiating, or imposing civil, criminal, administrative, or professional liability or sanction related to reproductive health care services or gender-affirming care that were lawfully provided in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or in another jurisdiction where such care was lawful at the time it was provided)." This reflects Massachusetts law and Fenway Health's mission as an LGBTQ-focused health center.

**42 CFR Part 2:** "I understand that substance abuse records are protected by 42 CFR, Part 2 and may not be disclosed without my specific authorizations." Correctly cited.

**No unreasonable barriers observed:** The form does not require notarization, does not mandate in-person submission (fax, email, mail, and portal are all options), and does not mention fees. The form does not bundle records release with any other consent.

**Potential concern — sensitive information initials requirement:** Section 6 requires patients to initial next to each sensitive category they want released, with the warning "COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO ENSURE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING." While this approach provides granular patient control, it could function as a barrier if patients skip or misunderstand the section — their records would be delayed or incomplete. The opt-out option ("I would NOT like any sensitive information disclosed") mitigates this somewhat, but the instruction framing is somewhat coercive in tone.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Companion FAQ sheet**: Fenway Health created a dedicated 3-page FAQ document (form-2.pdf) that explains every section of the ROI form in plain language. This is an uncommon and commendable patient-support practice that goes beyond providing the form alone.
- **Spanish-language version**: A fully translated Spanish version (form-3.pdf) is available, demonstrating commitment to language accessibility.
- **Multiple submission channels**: The form can be submitted via mail, fax, email (medicalrecords@fenwayhealth.org), or through the MyChart patient portal — four distinct pathways.
- **Reproductive and gender-affirming care protections**: The legal attestation explicitly protects against records being used for liability related to lawful reproductive or gender-affirming care, reflecting both Massachusetts law and Fenway Health's community mission.
- **Granular sensitive information controls**: The 10-category initials-based system in Section 6 gives patients unusually fine-grained control over which sensitive information categories are disclosed.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **FROM/TO structure unclear for patient self-access**: The form asks for "Sender/Facility's name" and "Recipient/Facility's name," which does not clearly accommodate a patient requesting records be sent directly to themselves. A patient would need to write their own name in the "Recipient/Facility's name" field, which is unintuitive and may cause confusion or processing delays.
- **"Abstract" definition may confuse patients**: Section 5 defines "Abstract" as "Includes 2 years of office visits, labs, immunizations, diagnostics and radiology reports" — but it's unclear whether this is the most recent 2 years or a specific 2-year window, and patients may not understand the term "abstract" in a medical records context.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **No fillable form fields**: Despite being a digitally-created PDF with 7 fonts and clean layout, the form has zero interactive fields. This is a technical oversight — the form was designed digitally but exported without interactivity, forcing patients into a print-fill-scan workflow.
