# Evaluation: Minnie Hamilton Health System — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is an **Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information** form from **Mon Health Medical Center (MHMC)**, not from Minnie Hamilton Health System. It is branded with Mon Health's name, address ("1200 J.D. Anderson Drive, Morgantown, WV 26505"), phone/fax numbers, and pickup location ("99 J.D. Anderson Drive, Morgantown, WV 26505"). MHHS is an affiliate of Mon Health, but this form belongs to the parent system's flagship hospital in Morgantown — a separate facility roughly 150 miles from Grantsville, WV.

The form was downloaded as a reference document because MHHS itself does not publish any standalone ROI form. The other document in this collection (form-1.pdf) is a patient portal instruction sheet for sending documents to providers via Athena Health — also not an ROI form. In short, **no actual MHHS-branded ROI authorization form was found**; this Mon Health form is the closest related artifact from the affiliate network.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **not findable through MHHS channels at all**. It was located only by broadening the search to Mon Health, the parent/affiliate system, and was found on monhealth.com under billing/financial assistance documents. The MHHS website (mhhs.healthcare) has no downloadable forms section, no patient forms page, and no link to this document. MHHS directs all medical records requests through ChartRequest, a third-party portal at `app.chartrequest.com/p/l/minniehamiltonhealthsystem-grantsville`, where the authorization form is embedded in an account-creation workflow and is not available as a standalone download.

The URL for this form is descriptive but specific to Mon Health: `https://www.monhealth.com/Uploads/Public/Documents/Billing%20Financial%20Assistance/MHMC%20Authorization%20for%20Release%20of%20Protected%20Health%20Information_12.31.20.pdf`. A patient at Minnie Hamilton would have no reason to find or use this form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present; full text is extractable (5,075 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being a digitally-created document (not a scan), all fields must be completed by printing and handwriting or by using PDF annotation tools.
- **Page count**: 1 page, though it is a dense, large-format layout cramming a significant amount of content into a single sheet.
- **File size**: 4.1 MB — extremely large for a single-page text document. The metadata shows 40 embedded images and 107 fonts, suggesting heavy use of decorative elements, logos, or inefficient PDF construction.
- **Design origin**: The text layer and structured layout indicate this was created digitally (likely from a word processor or design tool), not scanned from paper. However, the lack of fillable fields means patients still need to print it out.

The 4.1 MB file size is notable — this is roughly 5× larger than typical single-page PDF forms and could cause issues for patients on slow rural connections, which is particularly relevant given MHHS's location in rural West Virginia.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The form packs a substantial amount of content into a single page, which is both a strength (completeness) and a weakness (density). The layout includes:

- **Patient demographics section** at top (name, DOB, address, phone, city/state/ZIP, email)
- **Direction of disclosure**: "RELEASE TO OR OBTAIN FROM" with recipient fields
- **Purpose checkboxes**: Continuing Care/Medical Facility, Legal, Personal Use, Insurance, Other
- **Record types**: Inpatient, Emergency Dept., Outpatient Surgery, Outpatient Testing, Physician Office — each with date fields
- **Specific information checkboxes**: 15 categories including Discharge Summary, Laboratory Reports, ER Dept Record, Radiology Reports/Images, Operative Report, Medication Records, etc.
- **Sensitive information opt-out**: HIV, Substance Abuse, Behavioral Health exclusion checkboxes
- **Method of delivery**: Paper, Electronic Media/CD, or in-person pickup
- **Legal terms**: Nine bullet-pointed disclosures
- **Signature block** with witness line and legal representative provisions
- **Office use section** at bottom

The legal language is dense but reasonably clear. The bullet points cover revocation rights, redisclosure warnings, refusal-to-sign protections, minor consent provisions, fee disclosures, and the right to a copy of the signed authorization. The form references "West Virginia State Laws (§16-29-2)" for fee authority.

The single-page design means everything is compressed. With 107 fonts detected, the typography may be visually cluttered, and space for handwritten entries is likely minimal.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is a **general-purpose authorization** that covers both directions — "RELEASE TO" and "OBTAIN FROM." A patient requesting their own records would check "RELEASE TO" with themselves as recipient and select "Personal Use" as the purpose. The form does include "Personal Use" as a purpose option and "Me (Indicated above)" appears to be an option for the recipient, which is somewhat patient-friendly. However, the overall framing — "I HEREBY AUTHORIZE MON HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER (MHMC) TO: RELEASE TO OR OBTAIN FROM" — is designed around third-party disclosure scenarios.

**Scope options**: Good granularity. Patients can specify:
- Five types of records with date ranges
- Fifteen categories of specific clinical information
- Opt-out for sensitive categories (HIV, substance abuse, behavioral health)

**Format/delivery options**: Three choices — Paper, Electronic Media/CD, or in-person pickup at "99 J.D. Anderson Drive, Morgantown, WV 26505." No email delivery or patient portal download option is offered. The pickup address is in Morgantown, not Grantsville.

**Timeframe**: The form states that "federal and state regulation timeframes allow thirty (30) days to process," which is accurate for HIPAA's general standard.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access specifically. It references only WV State Law §16-29-2 regarding fees.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Fees**: States "a reasonable fee may be charged for copies of healthcare records" per WV §16-29-2, and notes that "copies of my healthcare records that are provided for my continued care will be provided to the healthcare provider at no charge." This is for provider-to-provider transfers; it does not clearly state fee terms for patient self-access under HIPAA's cost-based fee limitation.
- **Revocation**: Properly notes patients may revoke "at any time, provided that I do so in writing."
- **Refusal to sign**: Correctly states "my refusal to sign will not affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment or my eligibility for benefits."
- **Redisclosure warning**: Present and appropriate.
- **Witness requirement**: The form includes a "Witnessed by" signature line and a "Date/Time of Witnessed" field. While not explicitly stated as mandatory, the presence of a dedicated witness field may create a practical barrier — patients filling out the form at home may feel they need a witness.
- **Identification verification**: The "FOR OFFICE USE ONLY" section includes "Identification verified by: Patient Known To Staff / Photo ID / Signature Checked."
- **Authorization expiration**: No explicit expiration date is mentioned on the form. The authorization does not auto-expire, which could be either positive (no unnecessary time pressure) or concerning (open-ended authorization).
- **Minor consent**: Addresses minor consent under WV law, noting specific carve-outs for "marriage, emancipation, STD, substance/alcohol abuse, or birth control/pregnancy related care."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Wrong organization**: This form is branded exclusively for Mon Health Medical Center in Morgantown, WV — it is not the form for Minnie Hamilton Health System. A patient at MHHS cannot use this form to request their records. The header reads "Mon Health Medical Center (MHMC)" with Morgantown contact information, and the authorization language specifically names MHMC. This represents a complete mismatch between the form and the organization being evaluated.
- **No standalone MHHS form exists**: MHHS has outsourced records requests entirely to ChartRequest, which requires account creation before any authorization form is accessible. Patients without internet access or digital literacy cannot access the form at all through this pathway.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Witness requirement unclear**: The form includes a "Witnessed by" line but does not state whether a witness is required or optional. This could deter patients who assume they need a witness.
- **Fee language omits patient self-access fees**: The form references WV §16-29-2 for "reasonable fees" but does not distinguish between third-party fees and the HIPAA-limited cost-based fee for patient access requests. Patients requesting their own records may be overcharged if the facility applies standard copy fees.
- **No authorization expiration**: The form lacks any expiration clause. While this avoids arbitrary time limits, it also means a signed authorization could theoretically remain active indefinitely.
- **"Me (Indicated above)"**: This phrase appears in the text near the recipient section but its exact placement and function (checkbox? pre-printed option?) is ambiguous from the extracted text alone.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Oversized file**: At 4.1 MB with 40 embedded images and 107 fonts for a single-page document, the PDF is bloated by an order of magnitude. This suggests poor PDF construction — possibly exporting from a design tool without optimization.
- **Inconsistent addresses**: The header shows "1200 J.D. Anderson Drive" while the pickup location is "99 J.D. Anderson Drive." While these may be separate buildings at the Mon Health campus, this could confuse patients.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular record selection**: The form offers 15 specific categories of clinical information to check, plus 5 record types with date ranges. This level of granularity gives patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **Sensitive information opt-out**: The explicit opt-out checkboxes for HIV, Substance Abuse, and Behavioral Health information, with the default being inclusion, is a clear and well-structured approach.
- **Minor consent provisions**: The form addresses WV-specific minor consent carve-outs (marriage, emancipation, STD, substance abuse, birth control/pregnancy), which shows attention to state-specific legal requirements.
- **Refusal-to-sign protection**: The clear statement that refusal to sign "will not affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment" is a HIPAA-required disclosure that many forms omit or bury.
