# CrescentCare — form-2.pdf Evaluation

**Document:** form-2.pdf (Spanish-language ROI form)
**Source URL:** https://www.crescentcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Release-of-CrescentCare-Medical-Information_es.pdf
**Organization:** CrescentCare (New Orleans, LA) — FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a Spanish-language translation of CrescentCare's Authorization for Release of Medical Information, titled "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA LA DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN MÉDICA DE CRESCENTCARE." It is a direct translation of form-1.pdf (the English version), with identical structure, sections, and field layout. Both forms are single-page PDFs posted on the same Patient Resources page. The Spanish form serves the same purpose — authorizing CrescentCare to release a patient's protected health information (PHI) either to the patient or to a third party.

The filename `Release-of-CrescentCare-Medical-Information_es.pdf` uses the `_es` suffix convention, clearly identifying this as the Spanish variant.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was easy to locate. Per retrieval notes, a site-specific search confirmed its presence, and the Patient Resources and Downloads page (https://www.crescentcare.org/patient-resources-and-downloads/) lists the ROI form in both English and Spanish. The filename is descriptive and language-tagged. The URL path includes `wp-content/uploads/2025/11/`, indicating a WordPress-hosted file with a date-organized upload structure.

Retrieval difficulty was rated **Easy**. CrescentCare also provides a dedicated "Request your medical records" page at https://www.crescentcare.org/records-request-form/ with an online submission option, giving patients an alternative pathway beyond PDF forms.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 70,932 bytes (~69 KB) — very reasonable for a single-page PDF
- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (4,062 characters)
- **Image-only scan:** No — this is a digitally authored document
- **Fillable fields:** 0 — the form has no interactive form fields despite being digitally created
- **Fonts:** 6 fonts used
- **Embedded images:** 2 (likely a logo/header graphic)

The form is a digitally-generated PDF with a full text layer, meaning it can be read by screen readers and text can be selected/copied. However, the complete absence of fillable form fields is a notable gap — patients must print the form to complete it by hand. For a digitally-authored PDF, adding fillable fields would have been straightforward. The 6-font count and 2 embedded images suggest reasonable production quality.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality:** The entire form fits on a single page, which is efficient. The content density is appropriate — it covers patient information, recipient details, disclosure scope, special authorizations, purpose, expiration, patient rights, and signature blocks without wasting space.

**Language and clarity:** The Spanish translation reads naturally. Key terms include both the Spanish and English where helpful — for example, "información médica protegida (Protected Health Information, PHI)" provides the English acronym in parentheses, which is useful since PHI is a term patients may encounter in English elsewhere. Similarly, "HIPAA" is referenced untranslated as the well-known U.S. acronym.

**Organization:** The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow:
1. Patient information (nombre, fecha de nacimiento, teléfono, correo electrónico, dirección)
2. Recipient of information (with self-request option first)
3. Information to be disclosed (checkboxes)
4. Special authorization for sensitive records (initials required)
5. Purpose of disclosure (checkboxes)
6. Expiration
7. Patient rights and acknowledgments (4 bullet points)
8. Signature blocks (patient and authorized representative)

**Disclosure checkboxes:** Seven categories are offered: "Historia clínica completa," "Registro de vacunación," "Resultados de laboratorio/patología," "Notas de la consulta," "Historial dental," "Informes de diagnóstico," and "Otro (Especifique)." This provides good granularity without being overwhelming.

**Visual hierarchy:** The form uses a clear title in all caps and logical section breaks. The checkbox layout is structured in a multi-column grid for disclosure types and purposes, keeping the form compact.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form clearly supports both use cases. The recipient section begins with a self-request option: "Mí mismo a través de (marque una opción):" followed by "Portal del paciente," "Correo electrónico cifrado," and "Recogida." This design places patient self-access first, before the third-party release option ("O a:" — "Or to:"), which is a patient-friendly ordering.

**Delivery format options:** Three delivery methods for self-requests — patient portal, encrypted email, and pickup. These represent modern, practical options. Encrypted email is notable as a privacy-conscious electronic delivery mechanism.

**Scope options:** Patients can select specific record types via checkboxes and are not forced to request all records. The purpose section includes "Uso personal" as an explicit option, normalizing personal-use requests.

**Sensitive records:** The form separately gates disclosure of behavioral health records, substance use disorder records, and HIV/AIDS testing and treatment, requiring specific patient initials — consistent with Louisiana state law and 42 CFR Part 2.

**Patient rights:** Four acknowledgment bullets cover: (1) right to revoke in writing, (2) no treatment/payment conditioning on authorization, (3) re-disclosure risk, and (4) sensitive information only released if specifically authorized. These are clear and complete, though presented without citation to specific statutes.

**Authorized representative:** The form accommodates someone signing on behalf of the patient with checkboxes for "Padre/madre del menor," "Tutor legal," "Poder legal," and "Otro."

**Language access:** The very existence of this Spanish-language form is a significant patient-centeredness feature, especially for an FQHC in New Orleans serving a diverse population.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** Defaults to 1 year with patient ability to specify a shorter period: "esta autorización expirará en 1 año, a menos que se indique lo contrario a continuación: Fecha (no mayor a 12 meses) o evento." The 12-month cap is stated explicitly. This is a reasonable and standard approach.

**No-conditioning statement:** Included — "Entiendo que mi tratamiento, pago, inscripción o elegibilidad para los beneficios no estarán condicionados a la firma de esta autorización." This is required by HIPAA.

**Revocation right:** Stated clearly — patients can revoke "por escrito en cualquier momento enviando una carta firmada a CrescentCare." The requirement for a signed letter is a slightly higher bar than some forms (which accept any written notification), but is within HIPAA norms.

**No fee disclosure:** The form does not mention any fees for record copies. This is neither a red flag nor a bright spot — it simply means fees are not addressed on the form itself.

**No notarization or witness requirement:** The form does not require notarization, witnesses, or in-person submission — only a patient signature and date.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Bilingual availability:** Providing a fully translated Spanish-language ROI form is uncommon and especially appropriate for an FQHC in a region with a significant Spanish-speaking population. The translation maintains the English acronyms (PHI, HIPAA) in parentheses where helpful, aiding comprehension.
- **Self-request prioritized:** The form places the patient self-access option ("Mí mismo") before the third-party release option, signaling that patient access is a primary — not secondary — use case.
- **Electronic delivery options:** Offering patient portal, encrypted email, and pickup gives patients real choice in how they receive their records, with encrypted email being a privacy-conscious option many organizations don't offer.
- **Single-page efficiency:** Covering all necessary authorization elements on a single page without sacrificing clarity or completeness is well-executed.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Revocation mechanism in translation:** The form says the patient can revoke "enviando una carta firmada" (submitting a signed letter). It is unclear whether this must be a physical mailed letter or whether an emailed signed document would suffice. The English version uses the same phrasing ("submitting a signed letter"), so this ambiguity exists in both forms.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **No fillable fields:** Despite being a digitally-authored PDF, the form has zero interactive form fields. This is a functional deficiency — patients cannot complete the form electronically and must print it. For a form uploaded in November 2025, this is a missed opportunity given that fillable PDF creation is standard practice.
