**Organization:** Franklin Primary Health Center (Mobile, AL) — FQHC, independent, nonprofit

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)**, not a Release of Information or Authorization form. It is a 6-page document dated January 2, 2023, titled "Notice of Privacy Practices — Your Information. Your Rights. Our Responsibilities." It follows the standard HHS model NPP template closely.

In the context of the three documents found for Franklin Primary Health Center, this is the only one that directly describes patients' right to access their records. Form-1 is the New Patient Registration Packet (which contains a narrow "Assignment and Release" clause for insurance billing only), and form-3 is a standalone Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. None of the three documents is an actual ROI / Authorization for Release of Medical Records form. Franklin Primary Health Center does not appear to publish one online.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The NPP was found via direct web search but **not through intuitive website navigation**. Per the retrieval notes, multiple search queries were attempted — the NPP surfaced only when searching for `franklinprimary.org "release of information" OR "authorization" OR "medical records request" filetype:pdf`. The website's "For Patients" menu had no dedicated Medical Records or ROI page. The sitemap analysis confirmed no such page exists.

The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf`) is descriptive and well-named. However, the document is buried in a WordPress uploads directory with no obvious navigation path from the site's main pages. A patient looking specifically for *how to request their records* would not easily land on this document, and even if they did, it describes the right but does not provide a mechanism to exercise it.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present and fully extractable (10,753 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (0). This is appropriate for an informational notice — no fields are expected.
- **File size:** 1,011,197 bytes (~1 MB) for 6 pages. This is moderately large for a text-dominant document; the 3 embedded images (likely logos/headers) account for most of the size.
- **Font count:** 11 fonts used.
- **Digital-first design:** Yes — the document has a proper text layer, clean formatting, and appears to have been composed digitally (not scanned). Page footers are consistent ("Notice of Privacy Practices Jan 2023 / Page N").

The document is technically well-constructed as a digital PDF. Text extraction is clean with no OCR artifacts or garbled characters.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 6 pages. This is standard for a HIPAA NPP and proportionate to the content.

**Clarity:** The language is written in plain, patient-friendly English. It uses the HHS model NPP structure with short declarative sentences and everyday vocabulary:
- "Get a copy of your paper or electronic medical record"
- "We will say 'yes' to all reasonable requests"
- "We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint"

**Organization:** Logically ordered with clear section headings: "Your Rights," "Your Choices," "Our Uses and Disclosures," "Our Responsibilities," "Changes to the Terms of this Notice," and "Other Instructions for Notice." Bullet-pointed lists throughout.

**Visual hierarchy:** Section headers are present and formatted distinctly. Bullet lists improve scannability. The "Your Rights" summary on page 1 provides a quick overview before the detailed explanations on pages 2-3.

**Readability:** Text appears to be standard size (likely 11-12pt based on the content density). No evidence of cramped or overly small text.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Record access guidance:** The document clearly states patients' right to "Get a copy of your paper or electronic medical record" and elaborates: "You can ask to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and other health information we have about you. Ask us how to do this." However, this is the extent of actionable guidance — it tells the patient the right exists but defers to "Ask us how to do this" without providing a form, URL, portal link, or specific process.

**Response timeline:** States "We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information, usually within 30 days of your request."

**Fees:** Notes "We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee" without specifying amounts.

**Format options:** Mentions both "electronic or paper copy" as options, which is good.

**Scope options:** No guidance on requesting specific record types or date ranges — this is expected for an NPP, which is informational, not a request form.

**Representative access:** Addresses choosing "someone to act for you" including medical power of attorney and legal guardians.

**Complaint process:** Provides both internal contact (Privacy Officer, with mailing address, email, and phone) and external HHS OCR contact (address, phone, URL).

**Substance abuse protections:** Includes the statement "We will never share any substance abuse treatment records without your written permission" — a notable addition relevant to an FQHC population.

**OCHIN network disclosure:** Transparently explains participation in OCHIN organized health care arrangement and that health information "may be shared by Franklin Primary Health Center, Inc. with other OCHIN participants when necessary for health care operation purposes."

## 6. COMPLIANCE

This document is an informational notice, not an authorization form, so compliance evaluation applies differently. Observations:

- The 30-day response window and cost-based fee language align with HIPAA requirements under 45 CFR § 164.524.
- The document correctly distinguishes between situations requiring written permission (marketing, sale of information, psychotherapy notes) and those that do not.
- The self-pay restriction language is appropriately included: "If you pay for a service or health care item out-of-pocket in full, you can ask us not to share that information for the purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer. We will say 'yes' unless a law requires us to share that information."
- The limitation on accounting of disclosures (one free per year, then fee) is consistent with HIPAA.

No problematic compliance signals are present in this document itself. The broader concern is that **no actual ROI form exists online** — this NPP tells patients they have the right to request records but Franklin Primary Health Center provides no downloadable form to exercise that right.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **"Ask us how to do this"**: Both the record access section and the amendment section use this phrase. A patient reading this document remotely (e.g., downloaded from the website) receives no actionable next step — no form link, no portal URL, no email address for record requests. The Privacy Officer contact information appears only on page 6 and is framed for complaints, not record requests.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **HHS URL may be outdated**: The document references `www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/complaints/` and `www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/consumers/index.html`. These specific URL paths have historically been subject to restructuring at HHS.gov and may not resolve correctly.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Substance abuse protection statement**: "We will never share any substance abuse treatment records without your written permission" — this is a clear, unqualified commitment that goes beyond what many NPPs include, and is particularly relevant for an FQHC serving vulnerable populations.
- **Plain-language writing**: The document consistently uses accessible, non-legalistic language (e.g., "We will say 'yes' to all reasonable requests" rather than regulatory jargon), closely following the HHS model NPP template designed for patient comprehension.
- **OCHIN transparency**: The detailed explanation of the OCHIN organized health care arrangement on page 6 is unusually transparent about data sharing within a health information network.
