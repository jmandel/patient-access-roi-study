# Owensboro Health — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is **not** an authorization form itself but rather a **companion instruction document** titled "Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Health Information (INSTRUCTIONS)." The subtitle reads "How to Complete the Medical Record Authorization Form." It is a 2-page, 205,930-byte PDF that walks through each section of the actual authorization form (form-1.pdf), explaining what to enter and what each section means.

Owensboro Health provides two documents as a pair:
- **form-1.pdf**: The actual ROI authorization form (2 pages, 187,873 bytes, rev. 11-9-23)
- **form-2.pdf**: This instruction document (2 pages, 205,930 bytes, rev. 12/7/23)

The instruction document was revised roughly a month after the form itself (12/7/23 vs. 11-9-23), suggesting it was updated to reflect changes in the main form. Both are hosted on owensborohealth.org under `/sites/default/files/inline/`.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, both documents were found immediately via a simple web search for `Owensboro Health "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF`. No login, portal access, or multi-click navigation was required. The source URL (`https://www.owensborohealth.org/sites/default/files/inline/1a/health-disclosure-form-instructions.pdf`) uses the filename `health-disclosure-form-instructions.pdf`, which clearly identifies this as an instruction companion. The medical records page at `/locations/owensboro-health-regional-hospital-home/about-your-stay/medical-records` also surfaces these documents. Retrieval difficulty was rated "Easy" with no bot blocking or access barriers encountered.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (4,323 characters across 2 pages). This is a digitally-created document, not a scan.

**Fillable fields**: Zero fillable fields, which is appropriate since this is an instruction document, not a form to be completed.

**File format**: 205,930 bytes for 2 pages of mostly text content is somewhat large, likely due to the 2 embedded images (probably the Owensboro Health logo/header). 7 fonts are used. The document is digital-first in design.

**Structure**: The document uses a bulleted/indented list structure with section headings matching the actual form. Text is extractable cleanly without garbling or OCR artifacts.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages covering approximately 15 distinct sections of the companion form — proportionate and not excessive.

**Clarity**: The language is notably plain and patient-friendly. Instructions are written in second person ("Enter the patient's First and Last Name," "Tell us how you want to receive your records," "Tell us the date range when you received your care"). This contrasts with the more formal/legal language of the form itself.

**Organization**: Sections are presented in the same order they appear on the authorization form, making it easy to follow along. Each section begins with a bolded header (matching the form section name) followed by bullet points with guidance. The structure mirrors the form layout closely.

**Specific helpful explanations include**:
- Format/delivery guidance: "If you choose email, we will send the records encrypted to protect your privacy unless you tell us otherwise."
- Record type clarification: "Medical Records Abstract includes all pertinent information which includes H&P, Operative Reports, Consults, Test Reports and Discharge Summary."
- Practical example: "Other: Please describe the specific records you're requesting to help us respond more completely to your request. (Example: related to a condition or surgery, specific lab tests, etc.)."

**One organizational issue**: The "Where to send your request" section at the end lists three facilities (OHRH, OHMCH, OHTLMC) with addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and an email. However, the acronyms OHRH, OHMCH, and OHTLMC are used without being spelled out here. A reader must cross-reference the main form (which lists full names: Owensboro Health Regional Hospital, Owensboro Health Muhlenberg Community Hospital, Owensboro Health Twin Lakes Medical Center) to know which is which.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Orientation**: The instructions are written from the patient's perspective and assume the patient is requesting their own records. The language consistently uses "you" and "your records." The section on recipients says: "If you are wanting to receive your records check the box labeled 'Me'." This patient-access framing is helpful.

**EHI Export explanation**: The document includes a substantive explanation of EHI Export: "Electronic Health Information (EHI) refers to 'electronic protected health information (ePHI)' only to the extent that it would be included in the medical record. EHI does not include psychotherapy notes as defined in 45 CFR 164.501..." It also notes that "EHI export files will be delivered in 'computer readable format' (TSV) that may require the use of a special computer program." This is unusually detailed and transparent.

**Delivery mother's record**: Includes a unique notice about maternal records: "If you give birth at Owensboro Health a portion of your medical records will become part of the newborn medical record." This is a proactive, patient-friendly disclosure.

**Rights explanation**: States "This section is informational only. It explains your rights under state and federal privacy laws" — directing patients to the form itself where rights are spelled out in detail.

**Expiration**: Notes the 120-day authorization window clearly.

**Contact information**: Provides a phone number for additional help: "If you need additional help with completing the Authorization Form, call (270) 417-6800." This is a strong patient support signal.

**Submission options**: Lists mail (PO Box), fax, and email (himroi@owensborohealth.org) as submission methods for OHRH, and mail and fax for the other two facilities. The availability of email submission is a positive.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No barriers imposed**: As an instruction document, form-2.pdf does not itself impose requirements. It describes the 120-day expiration and representative documentation requirements, which are detailed more fully on the actual form.

**Legally authorized representative**: The instructions note "you may be asked to provide additional documents showing that you are the patient or patient's legally authorized representative" — appropriately vague for an instruction document, with specifics on the main form.

**No fee disclosure**: Neither this document nor form-1.pdf mentions fees for record copies, which is worth noting — patients have no advance notice of potential costs.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated instruction document**: Providing a separate, plain-language instruction companion to the authorization form is unusual and commendable. Most organizations offer only the form itself, leaving patients to decipher legal language on their own.
- **EHI Export explanation**: The explicit mention of EHI export with details about TSV format and scope ("ALL electronic health information related to the patient across the OHI organization and all Community Connect Partners") is well ahead of industry norms.
- **Help phone number**: Closing with "If you need additional help with completing the Authorization Form, call (270) 417-6800" is a simple but effective patient support measure.
- **Email submission available**: At least for the main hospital (OHRH), patients can email completed forms to himroi@owensborohealth.org, reducing the in-person/mail burden.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Unexpanded acronyms**: The "Where to send your request" section uses OHRH, OHMCH, and OHTLMC without spelling out the facility names. A patient unfamiliar with these abbreviations must cross-reference the main form to determine which address to use.
- **Email submission parity**: Email submission (himroi@owensborohealth.org) is listed only for OHRH. It is unclear whether OHMCH and OHTLMC accept email submissions, creating uneven access across the system's facilities.
