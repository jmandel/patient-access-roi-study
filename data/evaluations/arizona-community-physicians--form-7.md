## HIPAA Amendment Request Form

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **HIPAA Amendment Request Form** — a 2-page document for patients to request corrections or additions to their medical records. It is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) form. Rather, it exercises a different HIPAA patient right: the right to request amendment under 45 CFR § 164.526.

Within the ACP form ecosystem, this is one of seven downloadable forms. The primary ROI forms are form-1 (general authorization to release medical information), form-2 (practice-specific variant for Associates in Family Practice), form-3 (adult standing access designation), form-4 (imaging-specific release), and forms 5–6 (minor access designation in English and Spanish). Form-7 is the only amendment-related document.

The form is titled "Amendment Request" with the footer label "ACP Amendment Request Form" and is dated 06/12/2023. Page 1 contains the request form itself; page 2 provides patient instructions for the amendment process.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was found on the ACP website at `https://www.azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/HIPAA-Amendment-Request.pdf`, accessible from the organization's patient forms page (`azacp.com/forms/`). According to the retrieval notes, this forms page is linked from the main navigation under "Patient Forms" and all forms were clearly listed.

The URL path (`/HIPAA-Amendment-Request.pdf`) is descriptive, making it discoverable via direct search. The retrieval notes indicate that web searches for ACP forms returned direct URLs, and no difficulties were encountered finding or downloading any of the seven forms.

For an amendment request form — a less commonly sought document than ROI forms — being listed alongside other patient forms on an easily navigable page is reasonable. Most organizations do not publish amendment request forms online at all, so having one available is itself notable.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size**: 132,251 bytes (132 KB) — lightweight and suitable for download on any connection.
- **Page count**: 2 pages.
- **Text layer**: Present (`has_text_layer: true`, `is_image_only_scan: false`). The full text of 4,919 characters extracts cleanly, indicating good OCR or native text generation.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). The form is a flat PDF with blank lines indicated by underscores, designed for print-and-fill by hand.
- **Fonts**: 4 fonts used.
- **Embedded images**: 2 (likely logos or headers).

The lack of fillable fields means patients must print the form, hand-write their responses, and then submit via mail, fax, or in-person delivery. This is consistent with all other ACP forms (forms 1–6 also have zero fillable fields). The form instructs patients to mail, fax, or hand-deliver the completed form — no electronic submission option is mentioned despite ACP offering an online wizard for records requests (via Swellbox) for their ROI forms.

The text layer extracts cleanly with readable content, proper ordering, and no garbled text — a positive sign for assistive technology compatibility.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure and layout**: The form is organized logically across two pages. Page 1 collects patient identification and the amendment request details, ending with a signature block and an office-use section. Page 2 provides a numbered list of nine patient instructions.

**Patient identification fields** (page 1):
- Patient Name, Today's Date
- Patient Address, City, State, Zip
- Last Four Digits of SSN, Date of Birth, Phone
- Clinic Site, Provider
- MRN (Medical Record Number)

**Request content** (page 1):
- "Date of disputed entry"
- "In what documentation did you see this disputed entry"
- Instructions to "(1.) Describe how the disputed documentation is incorrect and/or incomplete. (2) Write exactly what you think the documentation should state to be accurate and/or complete."
- 7 lines of blank space for the written request
- A note: "If additional space is needed, use a separate sheet of paper and attach to this form. DO NOT write on the back of this form."

**Notification section**: The form provides 2 lines for names/addresses of additional persons to receive copies of amended information.

**Signature block**: Captures signature, printed name, relationship to patient, and date.

**Office use section**: Includes fields for verification, provider review, and outcome checkboxes (Granted / Partially Granted / Denied), plus ID verification (Driver's License / Government ID / Other).

**Instructions (page 2)**: Nine numbered items covering:
1. The right to request amendment
2. How to complete the form
3. 60-day response timeline with a possible one-time 30-day extension
4. Notification to previous recipients if accepted
5. Right to submit a statement of disagreement if denied
6. Right to file a complaint with HHS
7. The request becoming part of the permanent record
8. Contact information for questions (Corporate Compliance Director at (520) 327-0460 Ext. 1110)
9. Submission options: mail, fax, or in-person delivery with a specific address and fax number

The writing is clear and mostly plain-language, though it leans slightly formal. The instructions on page 2 are comprehensive and cover the key procedural aspects a patient would need to know.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Strengths**: The form clearly explains the patient's right to request amendment and provides a step-by-step walkthrough of what happens after submission. The 60-day timeline is explicitly stated, along with the possibility of a 30-day extension. The form also tells patients they can file complaints with HHS and provides a direct URL (`http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/index.html`). Contact information for the Corporate Compliance Director is provided with a direct phone extension.

**Concerns**: 
- The form asks for "Last Four Digits of SSN," which, while less than a full SSN, is unnecessary for an amendment request when MRN and Date of Birth are already collected. This creates a minor privacy risk for a document that must be printed and physically transported.
- Writing space is limited to 7 lines for what could be a complex medical record dispute. While the form acknowledges this with "use a separate sheet of paper," the instruction "DO NOT write on the back of this form" is unnecessarily restrictive for a printed form.
- There are only three delivery methods (mail, fax, in-person) — no email or online submission option. Given that ACP has a Swellbox-based electronic records request wizard, the absence of an electronic pathway for amendment requests is a missed opportunity.
- The form requires "one form for each amendment request," which could be burdensome for patients with multiple disputed entries.

**Language**: English only. Unlike the minor release form (forms 5–6 which have Spanish versions), no Spanish-language version of the amendment request form was found among the downloaded forms.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

The form aligns with HIPAA's amendment provisions (45 CFR § 164.526) in several respects:
- It acknowledges the patient's right to request amendment.
- It states the 60-day response deadline with a permissible 30-day extension.
- It notes the right to submit a statement of disagreement upon denial.
- It informs patients of their right to file complaints with HHS.

**ID verification**: The office-use section includes a field for "Form of ID presented for verification" with options for Driver's License, Government ID, or Other. While identity verification is reasonable, requiring in-person ID presentation could create a barrier for patients who mail or fax the form. The form doesn't clarify how identity is verified for mailed/faxed submissions.

**No fee mentioned**: The form does not mention any fee for processing an amendment request, which is correct — HIPAA does not permit fees for amendment requests.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **ID verification for remote submissions**: The office-use section requires "Form of ID presented for verification" (Driver's License / Government ID / Other), but the submission instructions allow mail and fax. It's unclear how identity verification works for non-in-person submissions — potentially discouraging patients from using the mail/fax options they're told are available.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **SSN collection**: The form requests "Last Four Digits of SSN" despite already collecting MRN, Date of Birth, and full name/address. For an amendment request form — which is not used for billing or insurance — this is unnecessary data collection that creates privacy risk, particularly for a non-fillable form that must be printed and physically transported or faxed.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Proactive publication of amendment request form**: Most healthcare organizations do not make amendment request forms available online. ACP's decision to include this alongside their ROI forms on a clearly navigable patient forms page demonstrates above-average commitment to patient rights accessibility.
- **Clear procedural instructions**: The nine-item instruction list on page 2 is comprehensive and well-organized, covering timelines, appeal rights, complaint pathways, and contact information — giving patients a complete picture of the amendment process without requiring them to research HIPAA independently.
- **HHS complaint reference**: The form includes a direct URL to the HHS Office for Civil Rights privacy page and explicitly tells patients they may file complaints with the Secretary of HHS — a right many organizations omit or obscure.
