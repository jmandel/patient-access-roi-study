# Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital — form-7.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-7 is **not a form at all** — it is a one-page instruction sheet titled "Instructions for Completing the Authorization for Release of Information Form." It serves as a companion guide to form-5 (the "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form), walking patients through each numbered section of that authorization form. It was created in 12/2025 per the footer ("Created by: Release of Information / Created: 12/2025").

In the broader set of seven documents retrieved for Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, form-7 is one of four documents linked from the system-wide medical records page (alongside form-4 the patient request form, form-5 the authorization form, and form-6 the Spanish-language version). The other three forms (form-1, form-2, form-3) are EAP or AMG-specific forms from other parts of the Advocate system. Notably, the Spanish-language form (form-6) includes its own embedded instructions on page 3, while this English instruction sheet is published as a separate standalone PDF.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The instructions document was found at a direct URL on the Advocate Health website (`advocatehealth.com/-/media/.../authorization-for-release-of-information-form-instructions.PDF`), linked from the centralized medical records page at `advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records`. Per the retrieval notes, navigating to this medical records page was the most productive strategy. The URL path includes the descriptive slug "authorization-for-release-of-information-form-instructions," which is clear and unambiguous. Findability is tied to the parent medical records page rather than independent discoverability — a patient searching for "Advocate instructions release form" would be unlikely to land on this PDF directly, but they would encounter it naturally when downloading the authorization form from the same page.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (3,485 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: 0 — appropriate, since this is an instructional document, not a form.
- **File size**: 130,370 bytes (~127 KB) for a single page. Slightly large for a text-dominant single page (likely due to 1 embedded image, presumably the Advocate Health logo), but not problematic.
- **Fonts**: 7 fonts embedded, indicating a digitally designed document with deliberate typography (likely headings, body text, bold variants).
- **Digital-first design**: Yes — the document reads as a natively digital PDF, not a scan of a paper original. The structured numbered list, consistent formatting, and embedded fonts all indicate digital authorship.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The document is well-organized as a numbered walkthrough (steps 1–8) mirroring the sections of the authorization form. Each step provides a brief, plain-language explanation:

- **Step 1** (Patient Information): "Please complete all required patient information, including the patient's full name, date of birth, street address, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, and email address."
- **Step 4** (Information Requested): Subdivided into A/B/C for medical records, imaging, and billing — matching the form's layout.
- **Step 7** (Format/Delivery Method): "Please choose how you would like to send the requested information by selecting an option under Mail, Electronic, or Other."

The language is generally plain and accessible, though it occasionally slips into legalistic phrasing, particularly in step 8 regarding minors: "If the patient is a minor, the minor may sign this authorization if they consented to treatment for pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, outpatient behavioral or mental health care, or outpatient treatment for substance use or alcohol." This mirrors the legal language verbatim from the authorization form rather than simplifying it.

At 3,485 characters on a single page, the length is proportionate to the task. The numbered structure provides clear visual hierarchy. The document is concise without being cryptic.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

The opening sentence immediately offers patients an alternative pathway: "To authorize the release of your protected health information, you may submit a request online through the LiveWell Patient Portal or submit a completed Authorization for Release of Health Information Form using the instructions below." This is a patient-friendly choice — surfacing the portal option before diving into paper-form instructions.

The instructions address both patient-access and third-party scenarios. Step 3A provides a notable clarification for behavioral health: "Ignore the check box if the patient is receiving their own records. This box is only used of [sic] the patient is allowing back and forth exchange of their health information between the receiving entity with the releasing entity." This is helpful because the mutual exchange checkbox on form-5 could easily confuse patients requesting their own records.

Step 7 acknowledges multiple delivery formats (Mail, Electronic, Other) and notes "fees may apply depending on the delivery method selected" — a brief but honest disclosure.

However, the instructions are specifically for the **authorization form** (form-5, the third-party release form), not for the **patient request form** (form-4). There is no equivalent instruction sheet for form-4. This means the companion guide is oriented toward a more complex workflow (third-party disclosure) rather than the simpler patient self-request process.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Signature requirements**: Step 8 states "Typed signatures are not accepted," requiring wet ink or equivalent. This is a common practice but could be a barrier for patients attempting to complete the process fully digitally.
- **Auto-expiration**: "If no expiration date is provided, the authorization will automatically expire in one year from date of signature." One year is a standard and reasonable default.
- **Fee disclosure**: Step 7 notes "fees may apply" without specifying amounts. This is vague — patients don't know what they'll be charged before completing the form.
- **Minor authorization**: The instructions reproduce detailed legal language about minor consent rules, including carve-outs for pregnancy, STDs, behavioral health, and substance use. This is legally required but presented without simplification.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Portal-first framing**: The very first sentence directs patients to the LiveWell Patient Portal as an alternative to the paper form, establishing digital access as the primary option.
- **Behavioral health clarification**: Step 3A explicitly tells patients to "ignore the check box" for mutual exchange when requesting their own records — a thoughtful clarification that prevents confusion on a commonly misunderstood field.
- **Recently created**: The 12/2025 creation date indicates this is a very new document, suggesting active investment in improving the patient experience around ROI forms.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Which form does this accompany?** The title says "Authorization for Release of Information Form" but the organization publishes both a "Patient Request for Health Information" form (form-4) and an "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (form-5). The instructions clearly map to form-5's structure, but a patient who downloaded form-4 might mistakenly try to use these instructions with the wrong form.
- **Fee vagueness**: "Fees may apply depending on the delivery method selected" gives patients no way to estimate costs before committing to a method. No fee schedule is referenced or linked.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Typo in step 3A**: "This box is only used **of** the patient is allowing..." should read "**if** the patient is allowing..." — a minor but noticeable error in a recently created document.
