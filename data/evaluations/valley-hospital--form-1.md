# Evaluation: The Valley Hospital — form-1.pdf

**Organization:** The Valley Hospital (Paramus, NJ)
**Type:** Community hospital, independent, nonprofit, Northeast
**Document:** form-1.pdf — "Authorization for Release of Patient Records & Information" (Valley Medical Group)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a general-purpose HIPAA authorization form for the release of patient records and information, branded to **Valley Medical Group (VMG)**, which is the physician services arm of the Valley Health System. The footer identifies VMG as the "trading as" name for Valley Physician Services, PC and Valley Physician Services, NY, PC. The form is titled "AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF PATIENT RECORDS & INFORMATION" and is structured as a two-page document: page 1 is the authorization itself, page 2 is a full page of "Directions for Completing the Authorization."

This is the **most current** of four forms found for the Valley Health System. The others are:
- **form-2.pdf** — An earlier VMG variant (May 4, 2023), nearly identical but with slightly different layout and a less detailed sensitive-information section.
- **form-3.pdf** — An older hospital-specific form for The Valley Hospital (Ridgewood, NJ), hosted on MRO Corp's website, dated 9/11 (September 2011 revision). Substantially different in structure and tone.
- **form-4.pdf** — A Valley Home Care–specific authorization (April 2023), similar template to form-1 but tailored for home care record types.

The existence of four overlapping forms — two VMG versions, one hospital-specific, one home care–specific — means patients may struggle to determine which form applies to their situation.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Difficulty: Moderate to Hard.** According to the retrieval notes, The Valley Hospital's medical records page (`https://www.valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records`) no longer links to downloadable PDF authorization forms. Instead, it directs patients to an online records request tool requiring identity verification via a driver's license photo. The PDF forms remain accessible at their direct URLs but are effectively **orphaned** — they are not discoverable through normal website navigation.

The form was found through direct web search (`"Valley Hospital" Paramus NJ authorization release health information form PDF`), which surfaced the URL. The URL itself is descriptive but deeply nested: `/sites/default/files/Patient%20%26%20Visitors/Medical%20Records/Authorization_VMG_FINAL_July%2031%202023.pdf`. A patient would not find this form without a search engine or prior knowledge of the URL.

The filename includes a date stamp (`July 31 2023`) but does not clearly indicate that this is the VMG form versus the hospital form — a patient looking for "The Valley Hospital" records release might not know that VMG is the relevant entity for their ambulatory visit records.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present. Full text is extractable (9,174 characters), enabling copy/paste and screen reader use.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). This is a flat PDF with no interactive form fields. Patients must print and hand-fill.
- **File size:** 208,995 bytes (~209 KB) for 2 pages — reasonable.
- **Fonts:** 9 fonts embedded. The text is digitally typeset, not a scan.
- **Images:** 2 embedded images (likely logos/graphics).
- **PDF design:** This is a digitally-created document (not a scan), with clean text extraction. However, the complete absence of fillable fields means it functions as a print-only form despite being born-digital. The checkbox options on page 1 (record types, delivery methods) are rendered as static text with empty boxes, requiring physical marking.

---

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages. Page 1 is the authorization form itself; page 2 is entirely dedicated to instructions ("Directions for Completing the Authorization to Release Information"). This is a reasonable length, though the instruction page is dense.

**Organization:** The form is divided into two clearly labeled sections:
- **Section A** — Patient/recipient information, delivery method, expiration, purpose, record description, and sensitive information consent.
- **Section B** — Signatures.

Page 2 provides numbered, step-by-step instructions corresponding to Section A and B fields. This is a logical and helpful structure.

**Record type granularity:** The form offers 16+ specific record type checkboxes including: Behavioral Health Specialist, Consultation Reports, Medication sheets, Entire medical record, Medication List, Consultation Report, Operative Report, Pathology Report/Slides, Physical (H&P), Progress Notes, EKG, Immunization Records, X-Ray and Imaging Reports, Laboratory Test Results, Psychotherapy Process Notes, Substance Use Specialist, and Clinical test/radiology result. There is also an "Other" field.

**Language:** Mixed. The rights statements (items 1–7 under "I understand that:") use moderately legible legal language. The instructions page uses plain language and is genuinely helpful — e.g., "If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF.'" and "event example: the end of my outpatient therapy." However, the sensitive information section is dense and could confuse a lay reader:

> "A separate form is needed to release 'Psychotherapy Process Notes' (specific details about psychotherapy treatment). If you wish to authorize release of Psychotherapy Process Notes and other health information, such as Laboratory Test Results, you must complete two authorization forms..."

The distinction between "Psychotherapy Process Notes" and "Psychotherapy Progress Notes" is technically important but will trip up most patients.

**Visual layout:** The text extraction suggests a moderately dense form. Nine fonts and structured layout indicate visual hierarchy, but the first page packs a lot: patient demographics, recipient info, delivery method options, expiration fields, purpose, a large record-type selection matrix, a sensitive-information consent paragraph, a seven-item rights list, and the signature block — all on a single page.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a **general-purpose authorization form** — not specific to patient self-access. The form directs information "to" a named recipient, which may or may not be the patient. The instructions helpfully clarify: "If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF.'" This acknowledges patient self-access as a use case but does not treat it as the default or primary path.

**Delivery method options:** The form offers five delivery methods:
1. Fax
2. Paper Copy
3. Electronic Media, if available (e.g., CD)
4. Unencrypted Email (with risk warning in instructions)
5. Encrypted Email

This is a relatively strong set of options. The inclusion of both encrypted and unencrypted email, along with a clear risk disclosure for unencrypted, is notable. The default if nothing is checked is paper copy.

**Scope options:** The form allows date-range specification and offers granular record-type selection with 16+ categories. Patients can name a specific physician. This gives good control over scope.

**Right of Access language:** The form references HIPAA generally ("I understand the terms of this Authorization are governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996") but does **not** specifically reference 45 CFR § 164.524 (Right of Access) or explain the patient's right to obtain their own records. Rights statement #5 says: "I understand that I may see and obtain a copy of the information described on this form, for a reasonable copy fee, if I ask for it" — but this is buried in the general rights list, not positioned as a primary feature.

**EHI Export / bulk data:** No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or any bulk data mechanism.

**Fees:** The instructions state: "There may be a fee for the release of the health information you requested. If a fee applies, an invoice will be sent prior to release of the health information. Fees may be based on the number of pages that would be produced for your request." No specific fee schedule is disclosed on the form itself. The form directs fee questions to MRO Disclosure Management Solutions (888-252-4146).

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Outsourced processing:** The form explicitly states that "Most requests will be sent to our copy service called MRO Disclosure Management Solutions" and provides MRO's contact information. This is transparent about the outsourcing arrangement but means patients interact with a third-party company rather than their healthcare provider.

**Authorization expiration:** "If Date or Event not filled out, Authorization will expire 1 year after date of signing." This is a standard and reasonable default.

**Voluntary nature:** Clearly stated: "I may refuse to sign this Authorization and that it is strictly voluntary" and "My treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on signing this Authorization."

**Revocation process:** Revocation must be in writing, sent to a specific individual at a specific address ("Valley Medical Group, 15 Essex Road, Suite 506, Paramus, NJ 07652, Attn: Julia Nidetz Karcher, SVP, VHS/VMG"). Naming a specific person creates a fragility — if this individual changes roles, the revocation address is stale.

**ID requirement:** The instructions require: "Please provide a copy of the patient's ID or the legal paperwork mentioned above, along with this request." This is stated as a blanket requirement without distinguishing between patient self-access and third-party requests.

**No submission method specified:** The form does not indicate how it should be submitted — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or portal link for the completed form itself. The only address given is for written revocations. This is a significant usability gap.

**Sensitive information handling:** The form's Section 9 instructions detail complex rules about behavioral health, substance use, and psychotherapy records. Notably: "If you check the 'Entire Medical Record' box, Behavioral Health Specialist and Substance Use Specialist records will not be provided unless you also check the appropriate specialist box." This means patients checking "Entire medical record" may unknowingly receive an incomplete record.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **"Entire medical record" does not mean entire.** The form explicitly states that checking "Entire medical record" will **exclude** Behavioral Health Specialist and Substance Use Specialist records unless those boxes are also individually checked. This is misleading — a patient checking "entire record" reasonably expects to receive all their records. The form uses the asterisk notation `(*see instructions for requirements & limitations)` on the form itself, but the critical exclusion is buried in instruction section 9b on page 2.

- **Blanket ID requirement without legal basis distinction.** The instructions state "Please provide a copy of the patient's ID" as a universal requirement without clarifying whether this applies equally to patient self-access requests (where HIPAA limits verification burden) versus third-party disclosures.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions.** The form tells the patient what to fill out but never says where or how to submit the completed authorization. There is no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal link for form submission. The only address on the form is for revocations.

- **VMG vs. Valley Hospital identity confusion.** The form is branded "Valley Medical Group" but is found under The Valley Hospital's website. A patient of The Valley Hospital proper may not realize this is the correct form for their ambulatory/outpatient records, or that a separate form (form-3) exists for hospital inpatient records. The footer note ("Valley Medical Group is the 'trading as' name for Valley Physician Services, PC") adds corporate complexity without patient clarity.

- **Fee ambiguity for patient self-access.** The form says fees "may be based on the number of pages" but does not distinguish between patient self-access fees (HIPAA-limited to reasonable, cost-based fees) and third-party release fees. The older hospital form (form-3) explicitly states "$1 per page" — it is unclear whether this fee structure still applies.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Named individual for revocations.** The revocation address names "Julia Nidetz Karcher, SVP, VHS/VMG" — this creates a form that becomes stale when personnel change. A role-based designation (e.g., "Privacy Officer") would be more durable.

- **Duplicate checkbox label.** The record type list includes both "Consultation Reports" and "Consultation Report" (singular) as separate items, which is confusing.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Comprehensive delivery method options.** Offering fax, paper, CD, encrypted email, and unencrypted email (with clear risk warnings) gives patients real choices. The encrypted email option in particular is a positive differentiator.

- **Full-page plain-language instructions.** Dedicating an entire page to step-by-step instructions with examples ("just write 'SELF'", "event example: the end of my outpatient therapy") is genuinely helpful. The instructions anticipate real patient questions and address them clearly.

- **Sensitive information transparency.** While complex, the form's handling of sensitive information categories (HIV, mental health, substance use, reproductive health) with explicit opt-in requirements reflects careful attention to state and federal privacy protections. The acknowledgment paragraph and instruction section 9's detailed guidance help patients understand what will and won't be disclosed.
