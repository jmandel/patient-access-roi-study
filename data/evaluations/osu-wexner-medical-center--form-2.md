## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a two-page "Authorization to Release Medical Information" document. Page 1 provides detailed instructions for completing the form. Page 2 is the authorization form itself, bearing the form ID "MC040184 (11/19)" — suggesting it was last revised November 2019.

The form covers multiple OSU entities: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital & Richard J. Solove Research Institute, and the Wexner Medical Center Ambulatory Surgery Center. It is a general-purpose release form — not specific to patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access. It is used for releasing records both to the patient and to third parties.

**Relationship to other forms**: The organization also provides form-1.pdf, which appears to be the same authorization form but as a single-page image-only scan (no text layer, 231 KB). form-2.pdf is the superior version: it includes instructions, has a full text layer, and was created with Adobe Acrobat Pro rather than scanned from paper.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present. The full text is extractable (5,505 characters), confirming this is a digitally authored PDF, not a scan. Created with Adobe Acrobat Pro.

**Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being created in Adobe Acrobat Pro — a tool fully capable of producing fillable PDFs — the form has no interactive fields. Patients must print the form and fill it by hand, or use annotation tools.

**Fonts**: 25 fonts embedded, which is a high count for a 2-page document. This suggests complex formatting or possibly mixed content (e.g., images of text alongside actual text).

**Embedded images**: 4 images embedded, likely including logos and possibly some graphical elements.

**File size**: 206 KB for 2 pages is reasonable.

**Digital-first assessment**: Mixed. The document has a proper text layer and was authored digitally, but the lack of fillable fields and the instruction requiring "wet ink signature" suggest it was designed primarily for print-and-fill workflows. The mention of "eSignature (e.g., Adobe) with a date & time stamp" indicates some awareness of digital use but no actual built-in digital signing capability.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — one page of instructions, one page of form. This is a reasonable length for an ROI authorization.

**Instructions page**: The instructions on page 1 are clearly numbered (1-7) and correspond to sections on the form. Each instruction explains what to enter and why. For example: "Purpose of Disclosure: Indicate the reason for release. This helps us to track and assign a priority status to your request. It also informs us who may be responsible for the cost of records (as appropriate)." This is helpful context.

**Clarity of language**: Generally clear and accessible, though not written at a low reading level. Phrases like "designated record set" and "re-disclosed by the recipient" are HIPAA-derived terms that may confuse patients. The instructions section is relatively plain-language.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → dates of service → records to disclose → purpose → source facility → recipient → legal disclosures → signature. This mirrors the instructions page ordering, which is well-designed.

**Record type checkboxes**: The form offers 9 specific record type categories: Emergency Department Records, Progress Notes, Discharge Information, Laboratory Reports, History and Physical Exam, Therapy Notes, Consults/Assessment, Pathology Reports, Plan of Care, Radiology Reports, Operative/Procedure Reports, plus an "Other" field. This is a good level of granularity.

**Purpose checkboxes**: Medical Treatment, Disability, Insurance, Legal Reasons, Personal, Other. This covers common use cases.

**Facility selection**: Checkboxes for Ross Heart Hospital, East Hospital, University Hospital, OSU Harding, James Cancer Hospital, Brain and Spine Hospital, Dodd Hall, plus "Other." This is useful for a multi-facility system but may be confusing to patients who don't know where their records are held — though the instructions helpfully note: "If uncertain about the location, select all box locations."

**Layout concerns**: Based on the extracted text, page 2 is quite dense. The form packs patient information fields, date ranges, record type checkboxes (12 options), purpose checkboxes (6 options), facility checkboxes (7+ options), recipient information, a substantial legal disclosure block, and signature lines all onto a single page. This is likely cramped, especially since it also includes submission addresses for three separate locations at the bottom.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a general-purpose release form — it does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records (HIPAA Right of Access) and authorizing release to a third party. The "Release Information To" section includes both internal OSU destinations and external recipients. A patient requesting their own records would use the same form as an attorney requesting records for litigation.

**No mention of HIPAA Right of Access**: The form does not reference 45 CFR § 164.524 or explain the patient's right to access their own records. There is no acknowledgment that patient self-access requests have different legal requirements than third-party releases.

**No electronic delivery option**: The form does not offer any option for receiving records electronically (email, patient portal, electronic media). The "Release Information To" section requests physical address, phone, and fax. "Patient's email" appears as a field label but is positioned under the recipient section, making its purpose ambiguous.

**Processing time**: The instructions state "Please allow 10 business days for processing," which is within the 30-day HIPAA limit (though HIPAA allows up to 30 calendar days with a possible 30-day extension).

**Fee disclosure**: The form states "a fee may be charged for copies of medical records" and directs billing questions to CIOX Health at 1-800-367-1500. CIOX (now Veraciti/Ciox) is a third-party release-of-information vendor. The fee structure is not disclosed on the form itself. For patient self-access requests, HIPAA limits fees to a reasonable cost-based amount — using a third-party ROI vendor for patient access requests raises concerns about fee transparency.

**Substance use disorder records**: The form correctly notes that "federal law prohibits further release of my information without my written consent and requires an additional specific form to be completed before the records are provided" for substance use disorder records. This adds a second form requirement for these records.

**Psychotherapy notes**: The form states "I know I need to sign a separate form to release any notes related to psychotherapy." This correctly reflects the separate authorization requirement under HIPAA for psychotherapy notes.

**Sensitive information disclosure**: The form includes a blanket statement that "the information released may include treatment for physical and mental illness, alcohol or drug use, AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) or HIV testing." There is no opt-out mechanism for sensitive categories.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Signature requirement**: The form requires "A wet ink signature and date on the form or an eSignature (e.g., Adobe) with a date & time stamp." Allowing eSignatures is positive, but the "date & time stamp" requirement for eSignatures may create confusion or barriers.

**Authorization expiration**: "This form is valid for one year unless I give written notice prior to the release of the information, as stated in the Notice of Privacy Practices." A one-year expiration is reasonable.

**Condition of treatment**: The form includes an appropriate statement: "treatment or payment for the care I have received at OSUWMC is not dependent on my signing this release, unless treatment is for research or the care was given to provide information to a third party." This correctly reflects HIPAA's anti-conditioning provision with the permitted exceptions.

**Re-disclosure warning**: The form warns that "information released as a result of this form may be re-disclosed by the recipient and may no longer be protected by federal or state privacy rules, such as HIPAA." This is standard and appropriate.

**"All sections must be completed in their entirety"**: The instructions begin with this blanket requirement. For a patient requesting their own records, requiring completion of all sections (including "Purpose of Disclosure" and multiple facility selections) may constitute an unreasonable barrier. HIPAA does not require patients to state a purpose for accessing their own records.

**Third-party vendor (CIOX Health)**: Records fulfillment is handled by CIOX Health, described as "a business associate." This is common practice but can introduce additional costs and processing delays for patients. The form provides CIOX's phone number for billing inquiries but no fee schedule.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Mandatory "Purpose of Disclosure" for all requests**: The instructions state "All sections must be completed in their entirety," which means patients requesting their own records must disclose a purpose. Under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), patients are not required to provide a reason for requesting their records. Requiring a purpose for patient self-access could be viewed as an unreasonable barrier.

- **Third-party ROI vendor handles fulfillment with opaque pricing**: Fee questions are directed to CIOX Health at 1-800-367-1500, with no fee schedule provided. For patient self-access requests, HIPAA limits fees to reasonable cost-based amounts. The lack of transparency about what patients will be charged, combined with use of a commercial ROI vendor known for charging higher rates, is concerning.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Form does not distinguish patient access from third-party release**: A patient requesting their own records uses the same workflow as an attorney or insurer requesting records. This conflation means patient self-access requests may be subjected to third-party release procedures, timelines, and fee structures that are more restrictive than HIPAA requires for patient access.

- **"Patient's email" field placement is unclear**: The field labeled "(Patient's email)" appears at the end of the "Release Information To" block alongside recipient address, phone, and fax fields. It's ambiguous whether this is for electronic delivery of records or simply a contact field for the patient.

- **eSignature "date & time stamp" requirement**: The form requires eSignatures to include "a date & time stamp," but doesn't specify what constitutes a valid stamp. Patients using simple annotation tools to sign may not produce a timestamp that satisfies this requirement, potentially leading to form rejection.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Form revision date (11/19) is over 6 years old**: The form ID "MC040184 (11/19)" indicates a November 2019 revision. The form has not been updated to reflect current 42 CFR Part 2 changes (2024 final rule) regarding substance use disorder records, nor does it reflect the 2021 information blocking rules under the 21st Century Cures Act.

- **Future date restriction in instructions may mislead**: The instructions state "Future dates of service cannot be requested" — while reasonable, this could confuse patients who want an ongoing authorization to cover a current course of treatment.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Numbered instructions corresponding to form sections**: The dedicated instructions page with numbered items (1-7) mapped to form sections is well-designed and uncommon among ROI forms. It meaningfully helps patients complete the form correctly.

- **"If uncertain about the location, select all box locations"**: This instruction for facility selection is practical and patient-friendly. Rather than requiring patients to know which specific facility documented their care, it allows a broad request.

- **Accepts eSignatures**: While many healthcare ROI forms still require wet ink signatures and in-person or mailed submission, this form explicitly accepts eSignatures (citing Adobe as an example), enabling some degree of remote submission.
