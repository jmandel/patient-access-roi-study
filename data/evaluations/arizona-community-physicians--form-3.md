# Evaluation: Arizona Community Physicians — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an **"Adult Release of Information Form"** (Form 116-Adult 18+, revised 11/28/18). Despite its title, this is **not** a traditional ROI/authorization form for requesting copies of medical records. Rather, it is a **standing access designation form** — it lets a patient list specific people (by name and relationship) who are authorized to access the patient's medical information on an ongoing basis.

The form's purpose is stated clearly: "Please list the names and phone numbers of anyone who has your permission to have access to your medical records. This information is not limited to but includes appointments, billing information and test results."

**Relationship to other forms found for this organization:**
- **form-1.pdf** is the primary general-purpose authorization to release medical records (Form 100), used for one-time records requests.
- **form-2.pdf** is a practice-specific variant of form-1 pre-filled for Associates in Family Practice.
- **form-3.pdf** (this document) is a standing consent designating who can access the patient's information.
- **form-4.pdf** is an imaging-specific release form.
- **form-5.pdf** is the minor equivalent of this form (Form 116 for minors).
- **form-6.pdf** is a Spanish-language version of form-5.
- **form-7.pdf** is a HIPAA amendment request.

This form serves a different purpose than a records request — it is about designating authorized contacts, not about requesting copies of records be sent somewhere. It would typically be completed during patient intake or when a patient wants to update who can receive information about their care.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found on ACP's patient forms page at `https://www.azacp.com/forms/`, which is linked from the main navigation as "Patient Forms." The URL (`Adult-Release-of-Information-Form-116.pdf`) is descriptive and clearly identifies the form type and number.

Multiple search strategies succeeded — both generic web searches and site-specific searches returned results. The forms page lists all available forms clearly. The retrieval notes characterize the process as having "No difficulties encountered — forms were easy to find and download directly."

The filename is descriptive ("Adult-Release-of-Information-Form-116.pdf"), though using the word "Release" in the title could cause confusion with the actual records release/authorization form (form-1), since this form serves a different purpose.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Format**: Single-page PDF, 96 KB — very compact.
- **Text layer**: Yes, full text is extractable (1,839 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (0). The form uses underline blanks (`____`) for hand-filling. It is designed to be printed and completed by hand.
- **Fonts**: 3 fonts embedded.
- **Embedded images**: 0 — the form is pure text/layout, no logos or graphics.
- **Digital-first**: No. This is clearly designed as a print-and-fill form. There are no interactive elements, checkboxes, or digital submission instructions.

The lack of fillable fields is a missed opportunity for a form that patients may need to update periodically. A fillable PDF or online form would allow patients to update their authorized contacts without needing to print, hand-write, and physically deliver the form.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 1 page — proportionate to the form's simple purpose.

**Structure**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow:
1. Header with organization name and form title
2. Patient identification fields (Account #, Name, DOB, Date, Guardian Name, Contact Number)
3. Introductory statement explaining the form's purpose
4. Three lines for authorized persons (name/relationship + contact number)
5. Voicemail permission section with cell/mobile and home phone fields
6. "DO NOT RELEASE" section for listing excluded persons
7. Acknowledgment and signature block
8. Footer noting the form stays in effect until updated

**Clarity**: The language is plain and accessible. The introductory text — "The confidentiality of our patient's medical information is very important to us. We understand there may be circumstances in which a family member or other adult needs access to your health information" — is warm and patient-friendly.

**Layout**: Reasonably clean for a non-fillable form. The form uses underlines for fields and groups related elements together logically. However, the voicemail permission section's language is slightly dense: "By providing the below phone #'(s) you are giving permission, to leave appointment information or detailed information regarding, lab results, radiological results or any other imperative information on the phone # indicated below."

**Field count**: Approximately 10 blank fields for patient completion (account #, name, DOB, date, guardian name, contact number, 3 authorized person entries, 2 voicemail numbers, 1 do-not-release field, signature/date/name).

**Limitations**: Only 3 slots for authorized persons and 1 line for persons to exclude — this could be insufficient for some family situations.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Purpose alignment**: This form is specifically designed for patients to control who has access to their health information. It empowers patients to both grant and deny access, which is a patient-centered feature.

**"DO NOT RELEASE" section**: The inclusion of a "DO NOT RELEASE Information to the following people" field is a notable patient-protective feature, allowing patients to explicitly block certain individuals from accessing their records.

**Voicemail permissions**: The form separates cell/mobile and home voicemail permissions, recognizing that patients may want different privacy levels for different phone numbers.

**Revocability**: The form states "I acknowledge that either I or the physician may, at any time, withdraw the option of releasing test information per the terms of this agreement, upon providing written notice." This is somewhat patient-friendly but also notable that the *physician* can unilaterally withdraw.

**Persistence**: The footer states "The information provided on this form will stay in effect until updated by the patient," which is clear and avoids arbitrary expiration dates that would burden patients.

**Limitations**: The form does not mention electronic submission options, patient portal access, or any way to complete/submit this form remotely. There is no mention of HIPAA rights, Right of Access, or any legal framework. This is understandable given that this form is about designating contacts rather than requesting records, but it means a patient who arrives at this form looking for a way to request their own records may be confused.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **No unreasonable barriers**: The form is straightforward and does not impose unusual requirements. No notarization, no witness requirements.
- **No fee disclosures**: Not applicable since this form is about access designation, not records copying.
- **No expiration**: The form explicitly stays in effect until updated, which is appropriate for a standing designation.
- **Physician withdrawal clause**: The statement that "either I or the physician may, at any time, withdraw the option of releasing test information" is slightly unusual — it gives the physician authority to unilaterally change who can access a patient's information without the patient's consent (beyond requiring written notice). This language is ambiguous about what specifically the physician can withdraw.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Title confusion**: The form is titled "Release of Information Form" but it is not a records release/request form — it is a standing access designation. A patient searching for a way to request their records could easily confuse this with the actual ROI form (form-1). The title would be clearer as something like "Authorized Contact Designation Form."
- **Physician withdrawal language**: "I acknowledge that either I or the physician may, at any time, withdraw the option of releasing test information per the terms of this agreement" — it is unclear what "the option of releasing test information" means specifically. Can the physician remove an authorized person from the list? Cancel the entire form? Refuse to share test results with anyone? The scope of the physician's withdrawal authority is vague.
- **"Guardian Name" field**: The form is titled "Adult Release of Information Form" (18+) but includes a "Guardian Name" field. It's unclear when this would apply — an adult patient typically does not have a guardian unless they are under legal guardianship, but no explanation is provided.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **"DO NOT RELEASE" section**: Proactively letting patients exclude specific people from accessing their information is a thoughtful, patient-protective feature not commonly seen on similar forms.
- **No arbitrary expiration**: The form explicitly stays in effect until the patient updates it, avoiding the burden of annual re-signing that many authorization forms impose.
- **Plain language**: The introductory text is warm and accessible, avoiding legalese.
