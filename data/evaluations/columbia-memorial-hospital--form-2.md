# Evaluation: Columbia Memorial Hospital — form-2.pdf (Spanish ROI Form)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Spanish-language Release of Information (ROI) authorization form** titled "DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN." It is the Spanish translation of the English ROI form (form-1.pdf, "RELEASE OF INFORMATION," HIPAA Form 3B). The Spanish version is designated "HIPAA Form 3Bsp" and was last revised 08-15-17, while the English counterpart was revised more recently (02-25, presumably February 2025).

The two forms share identical structure: Section A (patient demographics), Section B (record types to release), Section C (send-to/request-from addresses), Section D (special release categories requiring initials), Section E (purpose of authorization), and a page-2 hospital-use-only section. Both are 2 pages, similar file sizes (~150 KB), and both originate from the same Medical Records page on the hospital website.

Notably, page 2 of the Spanish form is **not translated** — it remains entirely in English ("Include this authorization in the individual's medical records," "FOR HOSPITAL USE," "Verification of ID," etc.). This is the internal-use page, so it is patient-facing only insofar as the patient receives the full document.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The Spanish form was easy to find. It was linked directly from the Medical Records page at `https://www.columbiamemorial.org/patients-and-visitors/medical-records/` alongside the English version. The search notes indicate the agent found both forms through basic website navigation — no deep digging was required. The source URL (`hipaa-form-3bsp.pdf`) uses a GUID-based path with a reasonably descriptive filename suffix ("3bsp" = Form 3B Spanish), though the URL itself is not human-readable. The Medical Records page reportedly labels the forms clearly enough that both language versions were identified immediately.

For a Spanish-speaking patient, the findability depends on whether the hospital's website navigation is available in Spanish. The form download link on the English-language Medical Records page would require English literacy to locate, creating a discoverability barrier for the very population this form is intended to serve.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — the full text is extractable (3,215 characters), confirming this is a digitally-generated PDF, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). The form uses underscores (`__________`) for blank lines, requiring the patient to print and handwrite entries. This is a significant technical limitation — the form cannot be completed electronically.
- **File format:** PDF 1.6, 149,829 bytes (≈150 KB) for 2 pages. File size is reasonable. The PDF contains 3 fonts and 2 embedded images (likely a logo and/or patient sticker placeholder).
- **Digital-first design:** No. This is clearly designed as a print-and-fill document. The underline-based fields, lack of interactive form elements, and "PATIENT STICKER" placeholders all indicate a paper-first workflow.

The form has the same technical limitations as its English counterpart — no fillable fields, no digital completion option. A Spanish-speaking patient would need to print the form, fill it by hand, and submit it physically (or scan and fax/email it back).

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages — page 1 is the patient-facing authorization; page 2 is for hospital administrative use only. The length is appropriate and concise.

**Organization:** The five-section structure (A through E) provides a logical flow: identify the patient → specify what records → specify where to send → handle sensitive categories → state the purpose → sign. This mirrors the English version exactly.

**Record type granularity:** Section B offers 11 checkbox-style record categories: "Sala de urgencias (Emergency)," "Resultados de laboratorio," "Datos de imágenes CD," "EKG/EEG," "Historial y físicos," "Notas, progreso del paciente," "Reporte quirúrgico," "Resumen de su alta," "Datos, expediente clínico," "Terapia física," and "Otro*." This gives patients meaningful control over what is released.

**Translation quality concerns:** Several items retain English terms in parentheses, e.g., "Sala de urgencias (Emergency)." This is helpful for bilingual comprehension. However, some translations are functional but stilted. The opening line reads: "Objetivo: el presente formulario representa la autorización para divulgar información de salud protegida (PHI)." This is grammatically correct but uses formal register that may not be maximally accessible to all Spanish-speaking patients.

**Signature block language:** "He tenido plena oportunidad para leer y tomar en cuenta el contenido de esta autorización. Entiendo que mediante mi firma estaré confirmando mi autorización para el uso y/o divulgación de mi información de salud protegida conforme se ha aludido en este formulario." This is a reasonable translation of standard authorization language, though "conforme se ha aludido" (roughly "as alluded to") is an unusual choice — the English version uses "as described in this form," and "descrito" would be the more natural Spanish equivalent.

**Font count:** 3 fonts — the same as the English version, suggesting consistent formatting.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** Like its English counterpart, this is a **general-purpose ROI form**, not a patient-access-specific form. Section C provides dual fields for "Enviar datos a" (Send Records To) and "Solicitar datos de" (Request Records From), accommodating both directions of information flow. There is no specific pathway or simplified process for a patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access.

**Scope options:** Patients can specify record types via the 11 categories in Section B and can write in a date-of-service or description-of-service. This provides adequate granularity.

**Format/delivery options:** The form does not offer electronic delivery as a patient-selectable option. Page 2's hospital-use section lists delivery methods (Pt. Pick-Up, Mailed, Faxed, Electronic), but these are staff checkboxes, not patient choices. There is no mention of patient portal access, email delivery, or electronic health information export.

**Rights language:** The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524, patient rights, or the right to access one's own records. It does not mention that records are free to patients (though the website reportedly states this). There is no mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

**Special categories:** Section D requires separate initials for HIV/AIDS, drug/alcohol diagnosis and treatment, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and genetic information. This appropriately handles sensitive categories requiring specific authorization under federal and Oregon state law.

**Language access:** The existence of this Spanish translation is itself a patient-centeredness feature — many healthcare organizations do not provide translated ROI forms. However, the form's utility is limited by the fact that page 2 is entirely in English and the website navigation to find the form appears to be English-only.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration/revocation:** The extracted text does not include explicit expiration or revocation language in the Spanish form body (the English version reportedly includes this). If the expiration language was omitted from the translation, this could be a compliance gap — HIPAA requires the authorization to include an expiration date or event and a statement about the right to revoke.

**Fee disclosure:** No fees are mentioned on the form itself. The notes indicate the hospital website states "Records are free to patients who request their records," but this information does not appear on the Spanish form.

**Submission method:** The form does not specify how to submit it. The hospital's contact information is listed (phone, fax, physical address), but there is no explicit instruction about acceptable submission methods. The lack of any electronic submission pathway means patients must print, complete by hand, and deliver physically or by fax.

**Revision date:** This form was last revised 08-15-17 (August 2017), making it nearly 9 years old at the time of evaluation. The English version has been updated more recently (revised 02-25). The discrepancy raises questions about whether the Spanish form reflects current organizational practices or legal requirements.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Outdated Spanish form vs. updated English form:** The Spanish version (revised 08-15-17) is approximately 8 years older than the English version (revised 02-25). This creates a risk that the Spanish form does not reflect current policies, legal requirements, or organizational practices — potentially disadvantaging Spanish-speaking patients.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Missing expiration/revocation language:** The extracted Spanish text does not appear to include an expiration date/event or right-to-revoke statement, both required elements under 45 CFR § 164.508(c). If these elements are present on the form but not captured in extraction, this is a metadata issue; if genuinely absent from the Spanish version, it is a compliance gap.
- **No submission instructions:** The form gives no guidance on how or where to submit the completed authorization (mail, fax, in-person, email). A Spanish-speaking patient unfamiliar with the hospital's processes would have little direction.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Page 2 not translated:** The entire second page ("FOR HOSPITAL USE") remains in English. While this page is primarily for staff use, the patient receives the full document and the instruction "Include this authorization in the individual's medical records" is not translated. The form identifier on page 2 also inconsistently references both "HIPAA Form 3" and "HIPAA Form 3Bsp."
- **Translation choice — "aludido" vs. "descrito":** The signature block uses "conforme se ha aludido en este formulario" ("as alluded to in this form") where the English version says "as described in this form." "Aludido" implies indirect reference rather than explicit description, which is a subtle but meaningful mistranslation in a legal authorization context.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish translation exists at all:** Providing a translated ROI form is uncommon, especially for a small independent critical access hospital in a rural Oregon community. This demonstrates attention to the language needs of the local population (Astoria and surrounding Clatsop County have a significant Spanish-speaking community).
- **Parenthetical English terms:** Including English equivalents like "Sala de urgencias (Emergency)" helps bilingual patients and staff navigate the form, reducing the risk of miscommunication about record types.
