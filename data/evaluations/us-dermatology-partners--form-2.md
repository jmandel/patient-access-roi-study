# Evaluation: U.S. Dermatology Partners — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "AUTHORIZATION TO USE OR DISCLOSE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION" form. It is an **older version** of the same ROI authorization also found as form-1.pdf. Both documents share identical extracted text (2,518 characters each) and carry the same revision marker ("Rev 08/2017"), but differ in file size (431,468 bytes for form-2 vs. 419,388 bytes for form-1), suggesting minor formatting or image asset differences between the two uploads.

The form-2.pdf was uploaded to the website in June 2019 (per its URL path: `/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/`), while form-1.pdf was uploaded in March 2020 (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/`). Form-1 is the version currently linked from the Patient Forms page; form-2 is no longer linked but remains publicly accessible at its original URL. Because the text content is identical, this evaluation necessarily mirrors the form-1 evaluation in substance, with differences only in findability and provenance.

The form serves dual purposes — it covers both **patient access** requests and **third-party disclosures** (e.g., to doctors, insurers, attorneys) using a single unified layout with checkboxes for purpose and direction of disclosure.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Form-2.pdf is **not discoverable through the organization's current website navigation**. It is not linked from the Patient Forms page at `https://www.usdermatologypartners.com/resources/patient-forms/`. It was found via web search using queries like `site:usdermatologypartners.com authorization release medical records`, which surfaced both the 2019 and 2020 upload URLs.

The file remains publicly accessible at its original URL (`https://www.usdermatologypartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Authorization-to-Use-or-Disclose-PHI.pdf`), but a patient navigating the website would only find form-1.pdf. This is a typical WordPress artifact — old media uploads persist unless explicitly deleted. The retrieval notes describe overall findability as "easy," but that applies to form-1; form-2 is findable only through search engines or direct URL knowledge.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Format**: Single-page PDF, 431 KB. Has a text layer (not an image-only scan), enabling text selection and screen reader access.

**Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite having clear form fields (patient name, DOB, address, phone, dates, signature, etc.), the PDF contains **no interactive form fields**. A patient must print and hand-fill or use PDF annotation tools. This is a significant usability gap for digital workflows.

**Fonts**: 9 fonts embedded, indicating reasonable typographic structure (headers, body, checkboxes).

**Images**: 1 embedded image (likely the organization's logo).

**Text extraction quality**: The extracted text is clean and fully legible. No OCR artifacts or garbled characters. Checkbox markers extract as Unicode characters. The form character content at 2,518 characters is compact and complete.

**Electronic submission**: The form mentions "Electronic (only available in patient portal)" as a delivery option for records, but this refers to how records are *delivered*, not how the form itself can be *submitted*. No electronic form submission pathway is described.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and density**: The form is compact at one page. It balances brevity with comprehensiveness reasonably well, though the density means some sections are cramped.

**Structure**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow:
1. Patient identifying information (name, DOB, address, phone)
2. Direction of disclosure (two radio-style options: from USDP outward, or from external entity to USDP)
3. Recipient/sender details
4. Delivery method (mail, fax, electronic via portal)
5. Purpose (Patient Access, To Doctor, To Insurance, To Attorney, Other)
6. Date range for records
7. Record types (Medical Records, Billing Records, Pathology Report ONLY)
8. Duration (One-Time vs. Continuing for 12 months)
9. Patient rights disclosures (5 bullet points)
10. Signature block

**Readability**: The rights disclosure section uses reasonably plain language. The opening line — "I hereby authorize use or disclosure of the named individual's health information as described below" — is legalistic but standard. The five bullet points under "I understand as the patient or person authorized to act on the patient's behalf the following applies" are readable though dense.

**Record type options**: Limited to three categories: "Medical Records," "Billing Records," and "Pathology Report ONLY." There is no option for requesting a complete designated record set, lab results specifically, imaging, or other granular categories.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access pathway**: The form includes "Patient Access" as a checkbox under Purpose, which is appropriate. However, the form's structure is oriented primarily toward third-party disclosures — the second section asks for "Name of individual or organization" and "Address of individual or organization," which is confusing when the patient is requesting records for themselves. A patient selecting "Patient Access" must still fill in a recipient section that doesn't clearly apply to self-requests.

**Delivery options**: Three delivery methods are offered: "Mailed to above address," "Faxed to above #," and "Electronic (only available in patient portal)." The electronic option is portal-gated, which may be limiting for patients who haven't set up a portal account. No email delivery option is offered.

**Rights information**: The form does inform patients of key rights:
- Right to receive a copy of the authorization
- Right to inspect records with a "reasonable fee" mentioned
- Right to revoke in writing at any time
- Signing is voluntary and not a condition of treatment

**Fee disclosure**: The form states "a reasonable fee may be charged for the records" but provides no specifics about what the fee is, what "reasonable" means, or any state-specific fee limits. This vagueness leaves patients unable to anticipate costs.

**No instructions or contact information**: The form provides no instructions on where to submit it (mailing address, fax number, email, office drop-off), no estimated turnaround time, and no contact number for questions about the records request process.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Liability waiver**: The form includes: "I release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure that may arise as a result of the use of the information contained in the Protected Health Information." This is a broad liability release bundled into the authorization. While common, it may discourage patients or create the impression that signing away liability is required to access records.

**Sensitive information disclosure**: The form states: "I understand that the information in my record may include information relating to sexually transmitted diseases, IDS, or HIV infection. It may also include information about behavioral or mental health services or treatment for alcohol and drug abuse." The abbreviation "IDS" appears to be a typo for "AIDS." This blanket acknowledgment does not provide granular consent for 42 CFR Part 2 substance abuse records, which require specific authorization elements.

**Continuing authorization**: The "Continuing Disclosure for 12 months" option is present, which is a standard HIPAA-compliant duration. No authorization is set to be indefinite.

**Revocation**: Right to revoke is stated clearly: "I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time, except to the extent that release has been made prior to my revocation."

**Expiration date**: The form does not include a specific expiration date field. HIPAA requires an authorization to contain "an expiration date or an expiration event" (45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(v)). The "Continuing Disclosure for 12 months" option partially addresses this for continuing disclosures, but one-time disclosures have no stated expiration. This is a compliance gap.

**Revision date**: The form footer reads "Rev 08/2017," making it nearly 9 years old at the time of evaluation. This raises questions about whether it reflects current state and federal requirements.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Bundled liability waiver**: The authorization requires patients to "release U.S. Dermatology Partners from any legal responsibility or liability for disclosure." Patients should not need to waive liability to exercise their right of access. This language is bundled into the authorization rather than presented as a separate, optional acknowledgment.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions**: The form contains no information about where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or office location. A patient who downloads and completes this form has no guidance on the next step.
- **Patient access vs. third-party release confusion**: When a patient checks "Patient Access," they must still fill in "Name of individual or organization" and its address. It's unclear whether they should put their own name, leave it blank, or interpret the field differently.
- **Vague fee language**: "A reasonable fee may be charged" gives no patient-actionable information about actual costs.
- **Missing expiration date field**: No explicit expiration date or event field for one-time disclosures, potentially creating a HIPAA compliance gap under 45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(v).

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo "IDS" for "AIDS"**: The sensitive information disclosure reads "sexually transmitted diseases, IDS, or HIV infection." "IDS" is almost certainly a typo for "AIDS."
- **Stale revision date**: "Rev 08/2017" is nearly 9 years old. Even though the file was re-uploaded in 2019 (and a textually identical version in 2020), no substantive updates appear to have been made.
- **Orphaned URL**: This form is no longer linked from the website but remains publicly accessible, potentially causing confusion if a patient finds it via search engine rather than the organization's current Patient Forms page.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Concise single-page design**: Fitting the entire authorization onto one page is genuinely patient-friendly. Many organizations use multi-page forms for equivalent content.
- **Explicit voluntariness statement**: "I understand that authorizing the disclosure of this health information is voluntary. I can refuse to sign this authorization. I do not need to sign this form to ensure treatment." This is clear, direct, and reassuring.
- **Bidirectional disclosure structure**: The form handles both outbound disclosures (from USDP to another party) and inbound disclosures (from another party to USDP) in a single form, reducing form proliferation.
