# Evaluation: Myrtue Medical Center — form-2.pdf

## Consent for Disclosure — Permission to Leave Phone Messages and/or Verbally Discuss Protected Health Information

---

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) form. It is a "Consent for Disclosure" form that authorizes Myrtue Medical Center to verbally share a patient's medical information with designated individuals — family members, caregivers, or others involved in their care or payment. It also covers permission for the facility to leave voicemail messages on the patient's phone.

The form is titled "HIPAA Privacy Form — Consent for Disclosure — Permission to Leave Phone Messages and / or Verbally Discuss Protected Health Information." It is a single-page document (411,772 bytes). The filename on the organization's website is `Consent-for-Disclosure-English-07-28-25[1].pdf`, indicating a July 2025 revision. The revision history footer reads: "Permanent Part of the Medical Record; Dev. 05/17, Rev. 06/21, 03/23, 12/24, 07/25."

In the context of Myrtue Medical Center's form suite, this is a **companion** to form-1.pdf (the actual "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" ROI form). The organization's website lists both forms on the same "Authorization + Release Forms" page, alongside their Spanish translations. Form-1 is the primary document a patient would use to request copies of their medical records; form-2 addresses a different use case — designating who the facility may *talk to* about a patient's care.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was easy to locate. It is directly linked from a dedicated "Authorization + Release Forms" page at `https://www.myrtuemedical.org/patients-visitors/authorization-release-forms/`, accessible within two clicks from the homepage (Patients + Visitors → Authorization + Release Forms). The site search `site:myrtuemedical.org medical records release authorization` returned direct PDF links. No bot blocking, JavaScript rendering issues, or login requirements were encountered.

However, the URL includes a bracketed artifact — `Consent-for-Disclosure-English-07-28-25[1].pdf` — suggesting a duplicate or versioning remnant from file management. This is cosmetically unclean but does not impair access.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present and complete. The full text (2,244 characters) extracts cleanly with no garbled characters or OCR artifacts.

**Fillable fields**: Zero (0) interactive form fields. The form relies entirely on printed underscores for handwritten input. Fields include patient name, date of birth, address, city/state/zip, phone, previous/maiden name, four sets of authorized-individual fields (name, relationship, phone), two checkboxes for sensitive information categories, and a signature block with date and relationship. Despite including checkboxes in the visual layout (for substance use/abuse and mental health), these are not interactive PDF form fields — they are static text characters (the extracted text shows `󠄀` placeholder glyphs).

**File format**: The file is a digitally composed PDF (not a scan), as evidenced by the clean text layer, 6 embedded fonts, and a single embedded image (likely a logo). At ~412 KB for one page, it is somewhat large — likely due to an embedded raster logo — but not problematic.

**Digital-first design**: While digitally composed (not scanned), the form is designed for print-and-fill workflows. Without fillable fields, patients must print, handwrite, and return the form via fax, mail, or in-person delivery. This is a paper-first design in a digital container.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page — appropriate for the limited scope of this form.

**Clarity**: The language is reasonably clear, though somewhat formal. The core authorization sentence is understandable: "I give permission for Myrtue Medical Center to verbally share my medical information with the following individual(s) identified below who are involved with my care or payment for my care." The conditional clause — "If the below is not completed, I only authorize Myrtue Medical Center to leave messages on my telephone" — is a helpful default that gives the form a dual purpose.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical structure: header with contact info → patient demographics → authorization statement → authorized individuals list → sensitive information checkboxes → legal disclosures → signature. This is a standard and sensible flow.

**Layout**: The form fits cleanly on one page. Authorized individuals are arranged in a four-row grid with name, relationship, and phone columns. The first two rows include additional labels for "If minor, Mother / Legal Guardian" and "If minor, Father / Legal Guardian," addressing custody situations. The legal disclosure paragraph at the bottom is a single dense block of text, but given the form's brevity, this is manageable.

**Font size**: Based on the digital composition and the amount of content fitting on one page, the text appears to be at or above 10pt — readable for most users.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Relevance to patient records access**: This form does **not** serve a patient requesting copies of their own medical records. It addresses a different HIPAA function — authorizing the provider to verbally disclose information to third parties involved in the patient's care. A patient wanting their records would need form-1.pdf instead.

**Scope**: The form allows patients to designate up to four individuals and to separately authorize or withhold disclosure of two sensitive categories: "Substance Use/Abuse (drug and alcohol)" and "Mental Health." This granularity is a positive design choice.

**Dual purpose**: The conditional clause ("If the below is not completed, I only authorize Myrtue Medical Center to leave messages on my telephone") allows patients to use this form solely for voicemail authorization without designating third parties. This is practical.

**Expiration**: The form states it is valid for "one (1) year from the date signed," with a right to revoke "at any time except where Myrtue Medical Center has already made disclosures with this request." This is clearly stated and reasonable.

**Re-disclosure warning**: The form includes a standard notice: "any disclosure of information carries with it the potential for unauthorized re-disclosure and the information may not be protected by federal confidentiality rules."

**Limitations**: No electronic submission pathway is mentioned. The form header provides phone, fax, and email contact information for Health Information Management, but the form itself does not describe how to submit it. There is no mention of electronic signature acceptance.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No significant compliance concerns** specific to this form's purpose. The form does what it claims — authorizes verbal/phone communication with designated individuals — and includes appropriate disclosures.

One area worth noting: the form states "I understand in certain situations Myrtue Medical Center may speak to other individuals who are involved in my care or payment for my care, if permitted by law, who may not be identified on this form." This is an accurate reflection of HIPAA's permitted disclosures (e.g., 45 CFR § 164.510(b)), but patients may find it confusing that the facility can talk to people not on their list. The "if permitted by law" qualifier is key but easy to overlook.

The one-year expiration is reasonable and clearly communicated. The right to revoke is stated. No unreasonable barriers (notarization, fees, in-person-only submission) are imposed.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish translation available**: The organization provides a Spanish version of this form (`Consent-for-Disclosure-Spanish-07-28-25.pdf`), demonstrating language accessibility for the community served.
- **Dual-purpose design**: The conditional clause allowing patients to authorize voicemail-only without designating third parties is a practical, patient-friendly design that reduces form burden.
- **Sensitive information granularity**: Separate checkboxes for substance use/abuse and mental health allow patients to control disclosure of specially protected categories, which aligns with 42 CFR Part 2 and state mental health confidentiality requirements.
- **Minor/guardian accommodation**: Including specific labels for "Mother / Legal Guardian" and "Father / Legal Guardian" on the first two authorized-individual rows shows thoughtful attention to common family situations.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Checkbox design is misleading in digital format**: The form presents checkboxes for "Substance Use/Abuse" and "Mental Health" with the instruction "Please check each box of information which is further protected by law," but the checkboxes are non-interactive in the PDF. It is unclear whether checking these boxes means the patient *authorizes* disclosure of this information or *restricts* it. The instruction "Please check each box" seems to prompt the patient to select categories they want disclosed, but a patient could reasonably interpret it as marking categories to exclude.
- **Submission method unstated**: The form provides no instructions on how or where to return it. The header lists phone, fax, and email for the HIM department, but the form body does not say "return this form to..." or indicate whether fax, mail, email, or in-person delivery is expected.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **URL artifact in filename**: The source URL contains `[1]` in the filename (`Consent-for-Disclosure-English-07-28-25[1].pdf`), suggesting a file management issue on the server — likely a duplicate upload that wasn't cleaned up.
