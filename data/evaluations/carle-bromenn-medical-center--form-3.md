# Carle BroMenn Medical Center — form-3.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**Document title:** "Authorization to Release Behavioral Health Information"
**Form number:** X3852-0620 (indicating a June 2020 revision)
**Pages:** 2 | **File size:** 76,259 bytes

This is a **specialized behavioral health ROI form** for Carle BroMenn Medical Center. It is one of three forms found for this organization:

- **form-1.pdf** — The primary general ROI form for the BroMenn/Normal campus (X3833-0820), 1 page
- **form-2.pdf** — A system-level Carle Health general ROI form for the Champaign campus (174-0319), 1 page
- **form-3.pdf** (this document) — A behavioral health–specific ROI form for the BroMenn/Normal campus, 2 pages

Form-3 covers the same facility cluster as form-1 — "Carle West Physician Group, Carle BroMenn Medical Center, and Carle Eureka Hospital" — but is restricted to behavioral health records. The general form (form-1) explicitly states "A separate special authorization must be completed to release behavioral health records," making form-3 the companion document referenced there.

The return address is the same HIM department at 1304 Franklin Ave., Normal, IL 61761, confirming this is facility-specific rather than system-wide.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was found via a web search for `"Carle BroMenn Medical Center" "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`. It was directly downloadable from `carle.org/getmedia/4bcb3033-c07d-4a38-9903-7e2c176c49ca/CBMC-Release-of-BH-Information.pdf` — an unobstructed direct link with no login wall or bot blocking.

The URL is reasonably descriptive (`CBMC-Release-of-BH-Information.pdf`), making it identifiable even from a link listing. However, it is a `/getmedia/` CMS path with a GUID, meaning it would not be easily guessable or navigable. The notes indicate the carle.org medical records page (`carle.org/patients-visitors/patient-resources/medical-records`) links to these forms, which is an appropriate location. The form was found on the first round of searching with no difficulties reported.

For a specialized behavioral health form, findability is reasonable — a patient would need to know they need a separate form for behavioral health records, which form-1 does communicate.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (4,746 characters). This is a digitally-authored PDF, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (0). Despite being a digital PDF with 8 fonts and clean layout, there are no interactive form fields. Patients must print and hand-fill or use a PDF annotation tool.
- **PDF structure:** 8 fonts and 1 embedded image (likely a logo). File size is modest at ~76 KB for 2 pages.
- **Digital-first design:** The document is clearly designed digitally (not a scan), with clean text extraction and consistent formatting. However, the lack of any fillable fields means it functions as a print-only document despite its digital origins. The form includes internal-use-only checkboxes at the top ("Record copy request only" / "No copies requested, scan only") that suggest a paper-based workflow.

The form is slightly longer at 2 pages compared to the general ROI forms (1 page each), which is understandable given the additional behavioral health consent language required.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure:** The form is organized into 16 numbered sections spanning 2 pages, following a logical flow:
1. Patient Information
2. Party sending records
3. Party receiving records
4. Purpose of disclosure
5. Date range
6. Description of records
7. Expiration
8. Canceling the authorization
9. Re-disclosure notice
10. Effect of not signing
11. Fees
12. Right to inspect & copy
13. Authorization/signatures
14. Instructions for record copies
15. Return address
16. Provider release notification (office use)

**Clarity:** The language is a mix of plain language and legal text. Section headers use parenthetical plain-language explanations — e.g., "PARTY WHO HAS MY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECORDS (Who Is Sending My Records)" — which is helpful. However, sections 8–10 are dense legal paragraphs with no bullet points or spacing to break them up.

**Record type options (Section 6):** The form provides 8 behavioral health–specific record type checkboxes:
- Hospital Consult-Psychology/Psychiatry/Neuropsychology
- Office Visit-Psychology/Psychiatry/Neuropsychology
- Hospital Progress Notes-Psychology/Psychiatry/Neuropsychology
- Neuropsychological Evaluation
- Labs, X-Ray, Billing Records, Other

There is also a "SPECIALLY PROTECTED RECORDS" subsection requiring separate check-and-initial for: Alcohol/Drug Abuse Treatment Records, Genetics, and HIV.

**Purpose options (Section 4):** Five choices: Medical follow-up, Employment reasons, Patient request, Underwriting (insurance), Lawsuit.

**Delivery options (Section 14):** Only two: "Mail record copies out" or "I will pick up records." Notably, unlike the general ROI forms (form-1, form-2), this behavioral health form does **not** offer a MyCarle Account (patient portal) delivery option.

**Typo:** Section 7 contains a misspelling: "this reuqest" (should be "this request").

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This form is a general-purpose authorization — it is not specifically designed for patient self-access. A patient requesting their own behavioral health records would use this same form, checking their own name in both the "sending" and "receiving" sections. The "Patient request" option in the purpose field (Section 4) does accommodate self-requests, with the parenthetical "(I do not wish to be more specific.)"

**Scope control:** The form offers reasonable scope controls — date range (Section 5), specific record type checkboxes (Section 6), and granular behavioral health categories. Patients can limit their request to specific types of records.

**Format/delivery options:** The form offers only mail and in-person pickup (Section 14). The absence of the MyCarle Account electronic delivery option — which is available on the general ROI forms (form-1, form-2) — is a notable gap for a behavioral health form. Patients requesting sensitive behavioral health records have fewer delivery options than those requesting general medical records.

**Rights language:** Section 12 states "I understand that I have a right to inspect and receive a copy of the records to be disclosed pursuant to this authorization," which acknowledges the right to access. However, it does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 specifically (the general forms do cite "CFR 164.524"). There is no mention of electronic health information (EHI) export or 21st Century Cures Act rights.

**Re-disclosure protections:** Section 9 includes important behavioral health–specific re-disclosure language: "the person who receives my behavioral health information, alcohol and drug abuse records or HIV records may NOT disclose it to someone else without my permission, unless permitted by law." This is appropriate for 42 CFR Part 2 protected substance use records.

**Witness requirement:** Section 13 requires a "Signature of Witness to Patient's Signature" in addition to the patient's own signature, which adds a barrier not present on the general ROI forms (form-1, form-2).

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fees (Section 11):** States "I may be charged a copying fee to complete this request. I may ask Carle for a fee estimate." It also discloses that "the bill may come from ScanStat, the company that processes health information requests for Carle." The use of a third-party vendor (ScanStat) for records processing is common but worth noting — fees from third-party ROI vendors have been a frequent source of complaints regarding HIPAA fee compliance.

**Expiration (Section 7):** The authorization requires a specific expiration date (MM/DD/YY). If none is specified, "information will only be released as of the date this request was received by Carle" — meaning the authorization effectively becomes a one-time release with no future scope. This is reasonable.

**Revocation (Section 8):** Revocation requires a written letter that must be signed, dated, and include a witness signature ("have a person who can identify me sign it as my witness"). This witness requirement for revocation goes beyond what HIPAA requires and adds a barrier to exercising the right to revoke authorization.

**Effect of not signing (Section 10):** Appropriately states that signing is not required for most health care services, with the narrow exception for visits solely to create information for someone else's use (e.g., pre-employment testing).

**Specially protected records:** The form correctly requires separate check-and-initial for alcohol/drug abuse records, genetics, and HIV — consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 and state law requirements for these specially protected categories.

**Age threshold:** Section 13 specifies "Signature of Patient 12 years old and over," which aligns with Illinois mental health law allowing minors 12+ to consent to certain behavioral health services and thus control release of those records.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Witness requirement for patient signature:** Section 13 requires a "Signature of Witness to Patient's Signature," which is not required by HIPAA for a patient access authorization. This creates an additional barrier — the patient must find someone to witness their signature — that is not present on the organization's own general ROI forms.
- **Witness requirement for revocation:** Section 8 requires that to cancel the authorization, the patient must not only write and sign a letter but also "have a person who can identify me sign it as my witness." This is an unusual and burdensome requirement for exercising the right to revoke an authorization.
- **No electronic delivery option:** Unlike the general ROI forms (form-1, form-2) which offer MyCarle Account delivery, this behavioral health form only offers mail and in-person pickup. While there may be privacy rationale, this creates a disparity in access convenience for behavioral health patients specifically.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **ScanStat fee uncertainty:** Section 11 mentions that bills "may come from ScanStat, the company that processes health information requests for Carle" but does not explain what fees might be or how they relate to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based fee limits. Patients are told they "may ask Carle for a fee estimate" but have no baseline expectation of cost.
- **Expiration date format:** Section 7 uses "Month (MM)/Date (DD)/Year (YY)" — the two-digit year format (YY) could create ambiguity (e.g., does "25" mean 2025 or 2125?). Minor but technically imprecise.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo in Section 7:** "this reuqest" should be "this request."
- **Missing HIPAA citation:** Unlike the general ROI forms which cite "CFR 164.524," this behavioral health form references the right to inspect and copy (Section 12) but omits the specific regulatory citation.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Plain-language section headers:** The form uses helpful parenthetical explanations in headers, e.g., "PARTY WHO HAS MY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECORDS (Who Is Sending My Records)" — making the legal structure more accessible.
- **Granular behavioral health record types:** Section 6 provides specific behavioral health record categories (psychology, psychiatry, neuropsychology consults, office visits, progress notes, neuropsychological evaluations) rather than a single "behavioral health records" checkbox, giving patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **Appropriate 42 CFR Part 2 protections:** Section 9's re-disclosure language correctly addresses the heightened protections for substance use, HIV, and genetic records.
- **Age-appropriate consent:** Recognition of patients aged 12+ signing for themselves aligns with Illinois law on minor consent for mental health services.
