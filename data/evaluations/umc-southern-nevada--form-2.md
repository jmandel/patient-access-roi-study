## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is the **older (2016) version** of UMC Southern Nevada's "Protected Health Information (PHI) Release Authorization" form, identified by version code MRU00695 dated 06/06/16. A newer version of the same form exists as form-1.pdf (MRU00695 dated 01/29/19). Both share the same form number (MRU00695), confirming this is a superseded revision that remains publicly accessible on the UMCSN website.

The document is a general-purpose ROI authorization — it covers both patient self-requests and third-party disclosures via a single form. A separate document (form-3.pdf) handles amendment requests.

Key differences from the newer form-1.pdf:

- Uses older field labels: "Account #" and "Med Rec #" versus the newer "CSN" and "MRN"
- Uses "Legal Representative" terminology rather than "Patient Representative"
- Lists **fewer clinic locations** on page 2 — missing Blue Diamond Quick Care, Centennial Hills (Quick Care and Primary Care), and Southern Highlands Primary Care that appear in the 2019 version
- **Omits "Email" as a standalone disclosure method** — the 2019 version adds this; the 2016 version only offers "Paper," "CD-ROM / disc," "Call for pick-up," "Send via US Mail," and "Send via Fax" with an "Other / Special Request" catch-all
- Disclosure method layout differs: form-2 has two separate "Other / Special Request" lines (one under Format, one under Method) while form-1 consolidates to a single "Other / Spec. Req." line

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this older form version was discoverable via web search at a direct URL (`https://umcsn.com/getmedia/38304303-0e51-4547-82ea-088afa777004/MRU00695PHI.pdf`) but is **not linked from the Medical Records patient-facing page**. The main patient information page at `umcsn.com/patients-visitors/patient-information/medical-records-and-birth-certificate-process` does not link to either version of the PHI Release Authorization — it only links to the amendment form.

The filename `MRU00695PHI.pdf` is marginally descriptive (includes the form number and "PHI") but would not be meaningful to a patient. A patient searching the web could encounter this older version just as easily as the newer one, with no indication on the form itself that it has been superseded. There is no "obsolete" or "replaced by" notice.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present and functional. The full text (4,813 characters) extracts cleanly with readable content, suggesting this is a natively digital PDF rather than a scan.

**Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite being a digital PDF with 10 embedded fonts, the form has no interactive form fields. A patient must print, hand-fill, and then scan/deliver the completed form. This is a significant usability gap for a document that is distributed digitally.

**File size:** 166 KB for 2 pages is reasonable but slightly larger than the newer version (152 KB), likely due to embedded images (3 images in both versions).

**Digital-first design:** The form was clearly designed digitally (not a scanned paper form), which makes the absence of fillable fields a missed opportunity. The header includes a barcode-like element (`*ROIRCD*`) and a "PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" instruction block — language oriented toward in-facility use where staff would apply a pre-printed patient label, not toward a patient filling it out at home.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** Two pages. Page 1 contains all substantive authorization content; page 2 is exclusively a location reference listing 7 Quick Care and 7 Primary Care clinic addresses (plus the Wellness Center). The content density on page 1 is high.

**Organization:** The form follows a logical flow: patient demographics → facility selection → record types → sensitive information consent → recipient → purpose → format/method → expiration → understanding statements → signature. This is a sensible sequence.

**Clarity:** Language is generally clear but formal/institutional. The sensitive information section is well-structured, requiring affirmative opt-in with individual initials for each category: "Alcohol, Drug, or Substance Abuse," "HIV Testing and Results," "Mental Health Records," "Psychotherapy Records," and "Genetic Records." The Yes/No checkboxes with per-category initials and dates of service provide granular control.

**Understanding statements:** The five numbered statements at the bottom are reasonably plain-language and cover key HIPAA-required disclosures: fees, voluntariness, non-conditioning, right to revoke, and re-disclosure risk. The revocation address is explicitly provided: "1800 W. Charleston Blvd., Las Vegas, Nevada 89102."

**Layout concerns:** The form packs a significant amount of content onto page 1. The header includes a dual-purpose patient identification block ("PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" alongside fields for Name, Age, DOB, Sex, Account #, Med Rec #), followed by a second patient demographics section (Name, DOB, SS#, Address, Phone, Email). This redundancy — the label block and the manual entry fields — is confusing for patients filling out the form outside a clinical setting.

**Page numbering anomaly:** The header reads "Page 1 of 1" despite the document being 2 pages. The second page of locations is apparently not counted as a form page, but this is technically incorrect and potentially confusing.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form serves dual purposes. It includes a "Patient (self)" checkbox under the recipient section, which is appropriate. However, the form is fundamentally structured as a release authorization (authorizing disclosure *to* someone), not as a Right of Access request form. The language "I authorize the following facility(ies) to release my Protected Health Information" frames the patient as an authorizer of disclosure rather than as someone exercising a legal right to access their own records.

**Scope options:** Good granularity. Patients can select specific facilities (main campus, individual Quick Care/Primary Care locations), specific record types (Abstracts/Summaries, ER Record, Radiology Reports, imaging, test results, or "Other"), and specify dates of service per facility.

**Sensitive information handling:** The five-category sensitive information section with individual Yes/No, dates, and initials is a strong design choice that gives patients meaningful control over highly sensitive record categories.

**Format and delivery options:** Limited compared to the 2019 version. Available options are Paper (default), CD-ROM/disc, Call for pick-up, US Mail, and Fax, plus two generic "Other / Special Request" lines. No explicit email option (unlike the 2019 revision). The CD-ROM option dates this form — while still functional, optical media is increasingly obsolete.

**Purpose field:** Requires selecting one purpose from Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Care, or Other. While HIPAA does not require patients to state a purpose for their own access requests, this field is presented without distinguishing between patient-self and third-party contexts.

**No patient rights explanation:** The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524, the Right of Access, or provide any educational context about patient rights. It does not mention electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Expiration:** Default one-year expiration from date of signature, with an option to specify a different date/event/condition. One year is a reasonable default.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fees:** Statement 1 notes: "Requests for copies of medical records are subject to reproduction fees in accordance with federal / state regulations." This is vague — it references fees without specifying amounts or a fee schedule. For patient access requests under HIPAA, fees are limited to reasonable cost-based amounts, but the form does not distinguish between patient access fees and third-party disclosure fees.

**Voluntariness and non-conditioning:** Statements 2 and 3 appropriately note that authorization is voluntary and that "Treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility for benefits may not be conditioned on whether I sign this authorization."

**Revocation:** Statement 4 requires revocation "in writing" to a specific address. This is HIPAA-compliant but could be more patient-friendly by also accepting email or portal-based revocation.

**SSN collection:** The form includes "SS # (optional)" — the "(optional)" designation is important and appropriate, though collecting SSN at all on a records release form raises questions about data minimization.

**Submission method:** The form itself does not specify how to submit the completed authorization. There is no fax number, email address, mailing address, or online portal mentioned for submission (the revocation address is given, but not explicitly for form submission). A patient would need to independently determine how to return this form.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No submission instructions on the form.** Unlike form-3 (the amendment form, which lists mail, walk-in, fax, and email submission options), this ROI form provides no guidance on how or where to submit the completed authorization. A patient who downloads this form has no clear next step for returning it.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Dual-purpose form without differentiation.** The form serves both patient self-access and third-party disclosure but uses identical language and requirements for both. A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access faces the same process as someone authorizing release to a third party, including the purpose field and the authorization framing.
- **"PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" header.** This instruction is meaningful in a clinical setting but confusing for a patient filling out the form at home. It's unclear whether the header block (with Age, DOB, Sex, Account #, Med Rec #) or the body fields (Name, DOB, SS#, Address) should be completed, or both.
- **Vague fee language.** "Subject to reproduction fees in accordance with federal / state regulations" provides no actionable information about expected costs.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Outdated/superseded form still publicly accessible.** This 2016 version has been replaced by the 2019 version (form-1.pdf) but remains hosted at an active URL with no indication it is obsolete. Patients could unknowingly submit the wrong version.
- **"Page 1 of 1" on a 2-page document.** The header states "Page 1 of 1" but the PDF contains a second page of location listings, creating an internal inconsistency.
- **Outdated clinic locations.** The location list on page 2 is missing clinics that appear in the 2019 version (Blue Diamond, Centennial Hills, Southern Highlands), meaning patients at those locations would not find their facility listed.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular sensitive information consent.** The five-category sensitive information section (substance abuse, HIV, mental health, psychotherapy, genetic) with individual Yes/No checkboxes, dates of service, and initials lines provides meaningfully granular control — better than many forms that bundle all sensitive categories into a single opt-in.
- **"Patient (self)" checkbox.** Explicitly acknowledging that the patient may be the recipient, rather than requiring a patient to fill in their own name and address in the "recipient" section, is a small but meaningful usability detail.
