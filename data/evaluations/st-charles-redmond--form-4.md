# St. Charles Redmond — form-4.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-4.pdf is the **current 2025 Spanish-language version** of the "Autorización para el Uso y Divulgación de Información Médica Protegida" (Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information). It is a system-wide form used across all St. Charles Health System locations — Bend, Redmond, Madras, Prineville, Sage View, and Center for Orthopedics and Neurosurgery. The form is identified as document number "3742 (English 3740) 2/25" on both pages.

This is the Spanish counterpart to form-3.pdf (the current 2025 English version, document number 3740). The organization also has two older English versions on file: form-1.pdf (April 2016 version, no longer linked from the website, no fillable fields) and form-2.pdf (November 2019/October 2022 fillable version). The form is a general-purpose authorization — it serves both patient self-requests and third-party releases, using "Remitente" (From) / "Destinatario" (To) checkboxes rather than having a dedicated patient-access pathway.

## 2. FINDABILITY

According to the retrieval notes, the form was **easy to find**. The St. Charles release of information page (https://stcharleshealthcare.org/patients/release-information) is clearly linked and explicitly provides both English and Spanish versions. Multiple search strategies — web searches for the organization name combined with ROI keywords, and direct site navigation — all surfaced the same page quickly.

The source URL (`/Documents/ROI/AuthorizationUseDisclosurePHI (ROI) - Spanish2025-fillable.pdf`) is descriptive and clearly identifies the language, year, and fillable nature of the document. The filename itself signals what the form is for. The release of information page provides context and instructions for patients about how to request records, including mention of the MyChart patient portal as an alternative for records from April 7, 2018 onward.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

The form is technically well-constructed as a digital artifact:

- **Text layer**: Present and fully extractable (8,583 characters across 2 pages). The Spanish text extracts cleanly.
- **Fillable fields**: 65 interactive form fields — a substantial number indicating thorough field coverage for all data-entry points (patient demographics, checkboxes for facilities, record types, date ranges, signatures, etc.). This matches the English version's 65 fields.
- **File size**: 344,105 bytes (344 KB) for a 2-page form — reasonable, slightly larger than the English version (336 KB) likely due to accented characters or minor layout differences.
- **Fonts**: 19 fonts embedded, indicating a digitally designed (not scanned) document.
- **Images**: 2 embedded images (likely logos or graphical elements).
- **Digital-first design**: This is clearly a born-digital, fillable PDF — not a scan of a paper form.

The form uses "Pacific Office Automation" as its print vendor, consistent across all form versions.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — appropriate for the amount of information collected. The form manages to fit patient demographics, sender/recipient identification, record type selections, sensitive information initials, authorization terms, format/delivery preferences, and signature blocks into a well-organized layout.

**Organization**: The form uses numbered sections (1 through 10) with instructions at the bottom of page 1 and continued on page 2. This numbered-instruction approach is helpful for guiding patients through a complex form. Each section maps to a corresponding instruction entry.

**Clarity**: The language is generally clear for a legal authorization form, though as with all such documents, it contains some formal/legal phrasing. The Spanish translation reads naturally — for example, "Motivo de la solicitud de información" (Purpose for requesting information), "Rango de fechas de los servicios" (Date Range of Services). Some English terms are retained untranslated — notably "Legal," "Insurance," and "Personal" in the purpose checkboxes on the first line, though "Seguimiento de la atención médica" correctly translates "Continuation of Care."

**Layout**: The form is dense but structured. Checkboxes, fill-in lines, and labeled sections create visual hierarchy. The two-column layout in sections 3-4 (sender/recipient information alongside facility checkboxes) is functional but may feel cramped.

**Readability**: Text appears to be in a standard readable size based on the number of characters relative to page count, though exact point sizes cannot be determined from metadata alone.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This is a **general-purpose authorization form**, not a patient-access-specific form. It uses "Remitente" / "Destinatario" (From/To) toggles to handle both directions. A patient requesting their own records would need to check "Remitente" next to their St. Charles location and "Destinatario" for themselves. This is workable but not intuitive for a patient unfamiliar with authorization form conventions.

**Scope options**: The form provides granular record-type selection: "Cada uno de los historiales (historial médico legal completo)" (complete legal record), visit summaries, emergency records, lab reports, radiology reports, cardiac tests, itemized billing records, and an "Otro" (Other) write-in option. Date range fields are included. This gives patients meaningful control over what they request.

**Format options**: Section 8 offers "Papel" (Paper) and "Vía electrónica (CD, Memoria USB, etc.)" with a note that requests over 250 pages will be delivered electronically. Delivery options include "Correo postal" (U.S. Mail) and "Recoger (solo en algunos lugares)" (Pick up at limited locations). No email or patient portal delivery option is offered on the form itself, though the website mentions MyChart as an alternative.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or use the phrase "right of access." It does include the important statement: "Ninguna determinación sobre tratamiento, pago, inscripción o elegibilidad para beneficios se basará en si firmo o no este formulario de autorización" — which paraphrases the HIPAA anti-conditioning requirement.

**EHI Export awareness**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or USCDI.

**Spanish-language availability**: The mere existence of this form is a significant patient-centeredness feature. Providing a fully translated, fillable Spanish-language version demonstrates commitment to serving Spanish-speaking patients — a meaningful portion of the Central Oregon community.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Signature requirement**: The form states "Debe estar firmado con bolígrafo" (Must be signed with pen/wet-ink). This is a potential barrier — it precludes electronic or digital signatures and requires patients to print, sign, and submit physically (by mail, fax, or in person). The English 2025 version (form-3) also has this requirement.

**Fees**: The form mentions "Se aplicarán las tarifas estándar por copia sujetas a la normativa federal y estatal" (Standard copy fees will apply subject to federal and state regulations) and "Se aplicarán cobros adicionales" (Additional fees apply) for radiology films/images. Fees are not quantified, which is standard but not transparent.

**Expiration**: "A menos que revoque esta autorización, vencerá en la siguiente fecha o evento: ____. Si no se especifica una fecha de vencimiento, esta autorización vencerá un año después de la fecha en que se firme." Default one-year expiration is standard and reasonable.

**Sensitive information initials**: The form requires separate initials to release alcohol/drug/substance abuse records, HIV testing records, mental health records, and genetic records. This is appropriate under both federal (42 CFR Part 2) and Oregon state law protections.

**Photo ID check**: The office-use section includes "Comprobación del documento de identidad con fotografía" (Photo ID checked), suggesting identity verification is required.

**Minor consent**: The instructions note restrictions on releasing records of minors aged 14+ (drug/alcohol) and 15+ (any records) without the minor's written authorization if the minor self-consented to treatment — correctly reflecting Oregon law (ORS 109.640 et seq.).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Wet-ink signature mandate**: "Debe estar firmado con bolígrafo" (Must be signed with pen) effectively requires physical document handling. For a patient requesting their own records — a HIPAA right — this creates an unnecessary barrier when electronic signatures are legally valid in Oregon and under federal law. This requirement appears across all current St. Charles forms.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Mixed-language purpose checkboxes**: The purpose field lists "Legal," "Insurance," and "Personal" in English, while "Seguimiento de la atención médica" is in Spanish. A Spanish-speaking patient may not understand the English terms without assistance, partially undermining the purpose of providing a Spanish-language form.
- **From/To confusion**: The form presents two nearly identical "Seleccione uno: Remitente / Destinatario" sections (sections 3 and 4) with no clear explanation of why there are two sender/recipient blocks in the main form body. The instructions (items 3 and 4) simply repeat the same text. A patient might wonder if they need to fill out both.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Truncated facility name**: In the facility checklist, "St. Charles Madras hospita" is truncated — missing the final "l" in "hospital." The English version does not have this error, suggesting a layout issue in the Spanish translation.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Full Spanish translation with fillable fields**: Providing a fully interactive, fillable Spanish-language version — not just a flat scan — is genuinely uncommon and demonstrates meaningful investment in accessibility for Spanish-speaking patients. Many healthcare organizations either have no Spanish form or offer only a non-fillable scan.
- **Numbered instruction system**: The 1–10 numbered sections with corresponding instructions at the bottom of each page help patients navigate a complex legal document step-by-step — a thoughtful design choice that reduces confusion.
- **Electronic format option with auto-escalation**: The note that "Las solicitudes de historiales de más de 250 páginas se entregarán por vía electrónica" (requests over 250 pages will be delivered electronically) shows pragmatic thinking about large record sets, and the availability of CD/USB delivery provides a digital alternative to paper.
