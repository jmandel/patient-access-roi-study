# Evaluation: The Valley Hospital — form-4.pdf (Valley Home Care Authorization)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an **Authorization for Release of Patient Records & Information** specific to **Valley Home Care, Inc.** (also styled "Valley Homecare, Inc." in the footer). It is a 2-page PDF (753,227 bytes) revised April 23, 2023. Page 1 is the authorization form itself; page 2 is a full page of "Directions for Completing the Authorization to Release Information."

This is one of four forms retrieved for the Valley Health System. The system maintains separate authorization forms for each entity:
- **form-1.pdf** — Valley Medical Group (VMG), July 2023 revision (most current VMG version)
- **form-2.pdf** — Valley Medical Group (VMG), May 2023 revision (earlier VMG version)
- **form-3.pdf** — The Valley Hospital (Ridgewood), older format hosted on MRO Corp's site
- **form-4.pdf** (this document) — Valley Home Care, April 2023 revision

The form-4 structure closely mirrors the VMG forms (form-1/form-2) but is tailored to home care services: the record-type checkboxes list home-care-relevant categories (Nursing Notes, Physical Therapy Notes, Occupational Therapy Notes, Speech Therapy Notes, Social Worker Notes, Nutritionist Notes) rather than the hospital/physician-oriented categories on the VMG forms. The revocation address points to "Valley Home Care, Inc., 15 Essex Road, Suite 301, Paramus, NJ 07652, Attn: Quality Department" — a different suite and department than the VMG form's "Suite 506, Attn: Julia Nidetz Karcher, SVP."

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Difficult to locate.** The retrieval notes indicate that the main medical records page (https://www.valleyhealth.com/patients-visitors/medical-records) no longer links to downloadable PDF forms, instead directing patients to an online records request tool. This form was found via direct web search, not through website navigation. Its URL (`/sites/default/files/Patient%20%26%20Visitors/Medical%20Records/Authorization_Home%20Care%20Release%20of%20Information%20(FINAL%20Rev%20April%202023).pdf`) is descriptive but only discoverable by someone who knows the pattern or uses a search engine with the right query.

A home care patient looking for this form would face a particularly confusing experience: the main medical records page doesn't link to it, and even if they found the VMG forms, they might not realize a separate home care–specific form exists. There is no indication on the website that different entities within Valley Health require different authorization forms.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (6,036 characters across 2 pages).
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (0). Despite being a digital-native PDF (not a scan), there are no interactive form fields. All data entry areas are blank lines or checkbox labels that must be printed and filled by hand.
- **File size:** 753,227 bytes for a 2-page text document with 1 embedded image. This is notably large — 3.6× the size of the comparable VMG form-1 (208,995 bytes for the same page count). The single embedded image (likely a logo) may be uncompressed or high-resolution.
- **Font count:** 9 fonts embedded.
- **Digital-first design:** No. Although the PDF has a text layer (not a scan), it is clearly designed for print-and-fill workflow. The checkbox options, blank lines, and signature fields all assume pen-on-paper completion.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure:** The form is organized into labeled sections — Section A (patient/recipient information, delivery method, expiration, purpose, record types, sensitive information acknowledgment), understanding statements (numbered 1–7), and Section C (signatures). Page 2 provides detailed instructions. This is a logical organization.

**Labeling anomaly:** The form skips from Section A directly to Section C — there is no Section B. On the VMG forms (form-1/form-2), Section B is "Signatures." Here, signatures are labeled "Section C" with no corresponding Section B, suggesting a copy-paste adaptation from a different template that was not fully reconciled.

**Clarity:** The authorization language itself is reasonably clear, though it uses formal legal phrasing. The understanding statements (items 1–7) cover standard HIPAA authorization elements in accessible language. The instructions on page 2 are written in a more conversational, helpful tone with numbered steps and examples (e.g., "event example: the end of my outpatient therapy").

**Record type options:** The form offers 11 record-type checkboxes appropriate for home care: Entire Medical Record, Nursing Notes, Physical Therapy Notes, Occupational Therapy Notes, Speech Therapy Notes, Laboratory Results, Social Worker Notes, Nutritionist Notes, Billing Records, and Other. This is a more focused and appropriate list than the VMG form's hospital-oriented categories.

**Length:** 2 pages is appropriate — 1 page of form, 1 page of instructions. The instructions are helpful rather than padding.

**Sensitive information consent:** The form includes an inline acknowledgment paragraph covering alcohol/drug use, genetic information, mental/behavioral health, tuberculosis, STDs, HIV, and reproductive health services. Unlike the VMG form-1 (July 2023 revision), this form does not provide separate checkboxes for behavioral health or substance use specialist records — the consent is bundled into a single blanket paragraph.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a general-purpose authorization form, not specific to patient self-access. The "Recipient's Name" field and instructions say: "If the recipient's name is the same as the patient, just write 'SELF.'" This accommodates patient access but doesn't prioritize or streamline it.

**Delivery method options:** The form offers five delivery methods: Fax, Paper Copy, Unencrypted Email, Electronic Media (e.g., USB), and Encrypted Email. The default is paper ("If left blank, a paper copy will be provided"). The USB option is a positive differentiator — the VMG forms list "CD" as the electronic media option, while this form has been updated to "USB," which is more practical in 2023.

**Unencrypted email warning:** The instructions (page 2, item 4) include a clear warning: "If you request your health information to be sent via unencrypted email, your health information is not protected from unauthorized access." This is appropriate transparency.

**Scope options:** Patients can specify date ranges and select from record-type checkboxes. The "Entire Medical Record" option is available. The form allows specifying purpose of disclosure with examples given in the instructions ("further treatment, insurance purposes, for attorney, personal use, etc.").

**Right of Access language:** The form references HIPAA generally (understanding item 6: "governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996") but does not specifically cite 45 CFR § 164.524 or use "Right of Access" language. There is no mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

**Fees:** The instructions state: "There may be a fee for the information you requested. If a fee applies, an invoice will be sent prior to release of the chart. Fees may be based on the number of pages in your chart. The fee schedule will be provided on request." This is vague — no specific fee amounts are disclosed, though it does say fees will be invoiced before release (allowing the patient to decide before paying).

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration:** The form includes a reasonable expiration mechanism: "Fill in the Date or the Event but not both. If Date or Event not filled out, authorization will expire 1 year after date of signing." A 1-year default is standard.

**Voluntary signing:** Item 1 states "I may refuse to sign this Authorization and that it is strictly voluntary." Item 2 adds "My treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned on signing this Authorization." Both are required HIPAA elements and correctly stated.

**Revocation rights:** Item 3 provides a specific address for written revocation. This is appropriate.

**Re-disclosure warning:** Item 4 covers the re-disclosure risk, including a mention that "State law limiting re-disclosure of specifically protected categories may continue to apply to any recipient." This is a more nuanced statement than some forms provide.

**ID requirement:** The instructions (Section C, item 3) state: "Please provide a copy of the patient's ID or the legal paperwork mentioned above, along with this request." Requiring ID for patient access requests is standard practice, though the phrasing could be read as requiring ID even for third-party releases that are authorized by the patient's signature.

**Fee structure:** The vague "fees may be based on the number of pages" language, combined with "The fee schedule will be provided on request," does not disclose specific amounts. For patient access requests under HIPAA, fees are limited to reasonable cost-based fees. The lack of specific disclosure isn't a violation but is less transparent than ideal.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Fee invoiced "prior to release"**: The instructions state "an invoice will be sent prior to release of the chart," which could function as a barrier — requiring payment before records are released. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, providers may charge a reasonable fee but should not unduly delay access pending payment. The phrasing suggests a pay-first model.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Missing Section B**: The form jumps from "Section A" to "Section C: Signatures" with no Section B. This may confuse patients who wonder if they missed a page or section. The VMG sibling forms use Section B for signatures, suggesting an editing error in this adaptation.
- **Entity name inconsistency**: The form body references "Valley Home Care, Inc." (understanding item 3) while the footer alternates between "Valley Homecare, Inc." (one word) in the footer stamp. The comma placement and capitalization differ between uses.
- **No submission instructions**: Unlike the VMG forms which mention MRO Disclosure Management Solutions as the copy service, the home care form provides no information about where or how to submit the completed form beyond the revocation address. A patient would not know whether to mail, fax, or hand-deliver the form, or to whom.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Oversized file**: At 753 KB for a 2-page text document with minimal graphics, the file is approximately 3.6× larger than comparable sibling forms. This suggests an uncompressed or poorly optimized embedded image, creating an unnecessary download burden.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **USB option for electronic media**: While the VMG forms still reference "CD" as electronic media, this form has been updated to "USB," reflecting current technology. This is a small but practical improvement.
- **Encrypted email option**: Offering encrypted email as a delivery method is a positive feature that balances patient convenience with privacy protection.
- **Detailed completion instructions**: The full page of step-by-step instructions with examples (page 2) is genuinely helpful, written in plain language, and likely reduces form completion errors.
