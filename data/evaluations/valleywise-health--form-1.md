## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **general authorization form for disclosing PHI to a third party** (Form #43439, document code DT7787, revised August 2024). It is a 2-page bilingual document — page 1 in English, page 2 is a full Spanish translation. The form is structured around 8 numbered sections covering patient information, recipient designation, information scope, sensitive-category exclusions, delivery method, verbal communication authorization, purpose of disclosure, and patient rights.

Critically, this is **not** a patient-access-specific form. It is designed for authorizing Valleywise Health to *disclose* records to a named third-party recipient. While "Personal Use" appears as one of the purpose checkboxes in section 7.0, the form is fundamentally structured around disclosure to a "Designated Recipient or Facility" (section 2.0), not around a patient exercising their HIPAA Right of Access.

Valleywise Health maintains a **separate** form specifically for patient access: Form 45643 ("Patient Request for Access to Protected Health Information," form-2.pdf). That form is explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records and cross-references form 43439 for sensitive-information authorizations. The existence of both forms means a patient requesting their own records should ideally use form-2, not this one.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, the form was found via a web search using `Valleywise Health "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`, which returned direct PDF URLs. A site-scoped search also located the Patient Records page at `valleywisehealth.org/patients/personal-health-record/`, which links to the forms.

The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VH_Form-43439-Auth-to-Use-or-Disclose-PHI_2024.pdf`) is reasonably descriptive — the filename contains the form number, a meaningful title abbreviation, and the year. No bot blocking, authentication, or other access barriers were encountered. The form was publicly downloadable from a standard WordPress media directory.

Findability is reasonable: a patient searching specifically for release/authorization forms would locate this without difficulty. However, a patient whose goal is to access their own records might find this form first and not realize that form-2 is the more appropriate choice, since both are available from the same page and "Personal Use" is listed as a purpose on this general disclosure form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size**: 82,165 bytes (82 KB) for 2 pages — reasonable and lightweight.
- **Text layer**: Present and fully extractable. The full text extracts cleanly at 12,138 characters across both pages. This is not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero**. Despite having checkboxes (☐), blank lines, and initial fields throughout, none are interactive PDF form fields. Patients must print the form and fill it by hand, or use PDF annotation tools.
- **Fonts**: 12 fonts used — a relatively high count for a 2-page form, suggesting some design complexity but no rendering issues observed.
- **Embedded images**: 4 (likely logos or decorative elements).
- **Digital-first design**: No. The form uses "Place Patient Label Here" (a physical label sticker), blank lines for handwriting, and initial lines — all hallmarks of a print-first document. The absence of fillable fields confirms this was designed to be printed and completed by hand.

The form is technically clean as a static document but offers no interactive functionality. A patient working digitally would need to print, fill, and then scan/fax/mail it back.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure**: The form is well-organized with 8 clearly numbered sections (1.0 through 8.0), each with a descriptive header. The logical flow is sensible: patient info → recipient → information scope → exclusions → delivery → verbal authorization → purpose → patient rights. This is a standard and effective ordering.

**Length**: 2 pages total, but since page 2 is the Spanish translation, the English content occupies a single page. This is compact for the amount of information covered and avoids unnecessary padding.

**Clarity**: Language is generally clear, though some sections mix plain language with legal phrasing. The patient rights section (8.0) is dense but covers required HIPAA disclosures comprehensively. The fee notice is indirect: "There may be a fee associated with your request for records; for more information, visit our website at www.valleywisehealth.org" — this neither specifies amounts nor provides a direct link to fee information.

**Layout concerns**: The top of the form includes a "VALLEYWISE HEALTH INTERNAL USE ONLY" section with internal routing checkboxes ("Release of sensitive information during an encounter," "Release to be processed by HIM," "No additional action needed, scan to patients chart"). This internal-use block is visible to patients and occupies prominent real estate at the top of the form, which may be confusing. The section 4.0 exclusions require patients to initial each category, and section 6.0 verbal authorization requires initials — adding friction.

**Bilingual presentation**: The full Spanish translation on page 2 is a positive feature, making the form accessible to Spanish-speaking patients without requiring a separate document.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Primary concern**: This form is **not designed for patient access**. It is a third-party disclosure authorization. A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524) should use form-2 instead. The inclusion of "Personal Use" as a purpose checkbox in section 7.0 creates ambiguity — a patient might use this form for self-access, but the form's structure (requiring a "Designated Recipient or Facility" in section 2.0) doesn't align well with that use case.

**Scope options**: Section 3.0 provides reasonable scope choices: "Pertinent Information," "Entire Chart," "Specific Information," radiology reports/images, billing, and an open "Other" field. Date/year specification is available for each option. This is adequate but less granular than form-2's record-type checkboxes (which list H&P, discharge summary, nursing notes, operative reports, etc.).

**Sensitive information handling**: Section 4.0 uses an **opt-out exclusion model** for sensitive categories (HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, substance abuse, genetic testing). The heading reads: "I specifically Request Valleywise Health to EXCLUDE from Disclosure Protected Health Information Related to." This means sensitive information is **included by default** unless the patient affirmatively initials to exclude each category. This is the reverse of the more protective opt-in approach typically seen, where sensitive categories require explicit authorization to *include*. For a third-party disclosure form, this default-include approach for sensitive categories is concerning.

**Delivery options**: Section 5.0 offers a wide range: mail, MyChart, pick-up, CD, USB drive, email, fax, and paper. The email option includes a thoughtful notice about encryption and gives patients the choice to waive encryption with initials. This is a strong set of options.

**Right of Access language**: No reference to HIPAA § 164.524 or the Right of Access. Section 8.0 states authorization is voluntary and treatment won't be conditioned on signing, which is appropriate for a HIPAA authorization but does not address patient access rights.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee disclosure**: The form states "There may be a fee associated with your request for records; for more information, visit our website." Fees are neither specified nor capped on the form itself. This indirect reference gives no information about whether fees comply with HIPAA's cost-based limits for patient access requests.

**Authorization expiration**: "Unless otherwise specified or revoked in writing, this Authorization will expire one (1) year after the date of signature." This is a reasonable default and standard practice.

**Voluntary nature**: The form clearly states: "Treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits may not be conditioned on signing this authorization. The provider will not deny me treatment if I do not wish to sign this form." This is appropriate HIPAA language.

**Revocation rights**: Clearly explained — revocation must be in writing, takes effect upon receipt, and doesn't apply to already-released information.

**Liability waiver**: The final bullet in section 8.0 states the patient "authorize[s] Valleywise Health, its employees, agents, officers, directors and medical staff members from any legal responsibility or liability for the disclosure of the above information." This is a broad liability release bundled into the authorization.

**No notarization or witness requirements**: The form requires only the patient's (or legal representative's) signature and date.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Sensitive information included by default**: Section 4.0 uses an opt-out exclusion model for HIV/AIDS, behavioral health, substance abuse, and genetic testing information. The patient must affirmatively initial to *exclude* these categories from disclosure. Most forms require explicit opt-in authorization to *release* sensitive categories, which is the more protective approach. For a third-party disclosure form, defaulting to include sensitive information unless the patient specifically opts out is a significant concern.

- **Broad liability waiver**: The patient rights section includes a blanket release of Valleywise Health "from any legal responsibility or liability for the disclosure." This goes beyond standard authorization language by seeking a full liability waiver as a condition of the disclosure authorization.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Personal Use" on a third-party form**: Section 7.0 lists "Personal Use" as a purpose, but section 2.0 requires designating a recipient/facility. It's unclear how a patient requesting records for themselves should fill out the recipient field — do they list themselves? This creates confusion when form-2 exists specifically for patient access.

- **Fee information is opaque**: "There may be a fee... for more information, visit our website" provides no URL path to the fee schedule, no indication of amounts, and no differentiation between patient-access fees (which HIPAA caps at cost-based rates) and third-party release fees.

- **Internal routing section visible to patients**: The "VALLEYWISE HEALTH INTERNAL USE ONLY" block at the top of the form, with checkboxes like "Release to be processed by HIM" and "No additional action needed, scan to patients chart," is prominently visible. Patients may be confused about whether they need to interact with this section.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Spanish translation has swapped section references in 6.0**: The English version of section 6.0 reads: "verbally discuss my protected health information and the specific protected health information in section 4.0. to the individuals listed in 2.0." The Spanish version reverses these: "hable con los destinatarios listados en la sección **4.0** sobre mi información médica protegida como también acerca de la información médica protegida específica de la sección **2.0**." Section 2.0 is the recipient designation and 4.0 is the sensitive information exclusions — the Spanish version directs patients to the wrong sections.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Full bilingual (English/Spanish) form**: The complete Spanish translation on page 2 — not a summary but a full parallel form — is a meaningful accessibility feature for Phoenix's large Spanish-speaking population.

- **Comprehensive delivery options**: Offering mail, MyChart, in-person pick-up, CD, USB drive, encrypted email, fax, and paper provides patients genuine choice in how they receive their records. The encryption opt-out disclosure for email is a thoughtful touch.

- **Separate patient-access form exists**: While this form is not ideal for patient access, Valleywise Health does maintain a dedicated Form 45643 for patients requesting their own records, which is a best practice that many organizations don't follow.
