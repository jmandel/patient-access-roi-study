## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-1.pdf is titled **"Patient Request for Access"** and is explicitly a patient-access form (as distinct from a third-party release). However, it belongs to **St. Luke's Hospital, 101 Hospital Drive, Columbus, NC 28722** — a sister AdventHealth facility approximately 40 miles from AdventHealth Hendersonville. The form header reads simply "Patient Request for Access" with the Columbus, NC address; there is no AdventHealth branding at all, and the body text reads "I am a patient of St. Luke's Hospital."

Three forms were found during retrieval, none specific to AdventHealth Hendersonville:
- **form-1.pdf** (this document): Patient Request for Access — St. Luke's Hospital, Columbus, NC
- **form-2.pdf**: Authorization for Release of Information — St. Luke's Hospital, Columbus, NC (general third-party release)
- **form-3.pdf**: Authorization for Use/Disclosure — Florida Hospital Heartland Division, Sebring, FL (entirely different state)

AdventHealth Hendersonville's own medical records page directs patients to a **Swellbox/Datavant online eRequest wizard** rather than providing a downloadable PDF. This form was found only because it is hosted on the adventhealth.com domain and appeared in web search results.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form is **very difficult to find** for an AdventHealth Hendersonville patient. The retrieval notes document multiple search strategies:

- Direct web searches for "AdventHealth Hendersonville authorization release health information form PDF" did not return this form or any Hendersonville-specific form.
- Navigating the AdventHealth Hendersonville website leads to a shared system-wide medical records page, which provides a Swellbox online wizard link but **no downloadable PDF form**.
- The form was only discovered through broad searches for AdventHealth PDF forms, which returned results from sister facilities (St. Luke's Hospital and Florida Hospital Heartland Division).
- The URL (`slh_form_medicalrecords_patientrequestforaccess.pdf`) contains the prefix `slh_` indicating St. Luke's Hospital — there is no corresponding `hvl_` or `prh_` prefixed form for Hendersonville.
- Direct URL guessing for Hendersonville-specific filenames returned 404 errors.

A patient at AdventHealth Hendersonville would not naturally find this form. They would need to either use the Swellbox wizard or call the HIM department (828-681-2135) for instructions. The form is not linked from any AdventHealth Hendersonville page.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (2,804 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite having underline blanks for every field (patient name, DOB, address, etc.), there are no interactive PDF form fields. Patients must print and handwrite.
- **File size:** 53,126 bytes (53 KB) for a single page — reasonable.
- **Page count:** 1 page.
- **Fonts:** 8 fonts embedded, suggesting some typographic variety (likely bold/italic variants).
- **Images:** 1 embedded image (likely a logo or barcode — the `*1PRFA*` text suggests a barcode identifier).
- **Digital-first design:** No. This is a print-oriented form with handwritten blanks (`_________________________________`). It was designed to be printed, filled by hand, and physically delivered. The checkbox options use plain text rather than interactive checkboxes.

The form is a flat PDF — usable for printing but not for digital completion. A patient who wants to fill it electronically would need a PDF annotation tool.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality:** The form is a single page, which is appropriately concise for a patient access request. It covers identification, scope, format, and delivery preferences without excessive verbiage.

**Clarity:** The language is relatively plain. The opening instruction — "If you would like a copy of your medical record, please complete the form below" — is clear and patient-friendly. The form avoids dense legal language, with only a brief note about email risks ("you acknowledge and accept the risks outlined in Guidelines for E-mail with Patients, provided separately if applicable").

**Organization:** The form follows a logical flow:
1. Patient identification (name, DOB, address, SSN last 4, phone, email)
2. Purpose (copy for self vs. send to third party)
3. Date range
4. Record type selection (Hospital, Office/Clinic, Behavioral Health sections with checkboxes)
5. Format preference (CD, Flash Drive, E-mail, Paper, Other)
6. Delivery method (Mail, Secure e-mail, Fax, Pickup)
7. Signature and date

**Layout:** The form is densely packed for a single page. Three columns of checkboxes (Hospital, Office/Clinic, Behavioral Health) are arranged side by side, which maximizes space efficiency but creates a somewhat cramped appearance. The underline blanks are standard but make the form look dated.

**Readability:** Text appears to be in a reasonable font size (likely 9-10pt given the density). The form code "MEDR 015" and date "6/2016" appear at the bottom.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access focus:** This is explicitly a **Patient Request for Access** form, which is a positive distinction from the general third-party release form (form-2.pdf). The opening text and title clearly frame this as the patient requesting their own records. However, it also includes an option to "send my records to" a third party, making it a dual-purpose form.

**Scope options:** Excellent granularity. Patients can specify:
- Date range for records
- Specific record types across three categories: Hospital (7 options + Other), Office/Clinic (6 options + Other + Entire Record + Itemized Bill), and Behavioral Health (6 options + Other + Entire Record + Itemized Bill)

**Format options:** Notably good. The form offers five format choices: **CD, Flash Drive, E-mail, Paper copy, Other**. The inclusion of electronic delivery options (email, CD, flash drive) is above average for ROI forms.

**Delivery method options:** Four delivery methods are offered: **Mail, Secure e-mail, Fax, Pickup**. The "secure e-mail" option is a thoughtful addition.

**Right of Access language:** The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or explicitly state the patient's right of access. It also does not mention any timeframe requirements (though a note says "it may take up to 30 days to schedule the appointment or provide copies").

**EHI Export:** No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Personal representative:** The form includes a note that "If the patient lacks legal capacity or is unable to sign, an authorized personal representative may sign this for the patient. (Written Proof May be Requested)."

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fees:** No fees are mentioned or disclosed on this form. (By contrast, form-2.pdf mentions "A fee may be charged for providing the protected health information.")

**Expiration:** No expiration date is stated on this form.

**Barriers:** The form does not require notarization. No explicit requirement for in-person submission. However, the lack of fillable fields effectively requires printing and either hand-delivery, mailing, or faxing.

**SSN collection:** The form requests "Last 4 numbers of SSN" — not the full SSN, which is reasonable for patient identification, though some patients may be uncomfortable providing even partial SSN on a form they must print and potentially mail or fax.

**30-day processing note:** The form states "it may take up to 30 days to schedule the appointment or provide copies," which aligns with HIPAA's 30-day response requirement.

**Wrong facility:** The most significant compliance concern is that this form is for St. Luke's Hospital, not AdventHealth Hendersonville. A Hendersonville patient using this form would be submitting a request to the wrong facility.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Wrong facility form:** This form belongs to St. Luke's Hospital in Columbus, NC — not AdventHealth Hendersonville. A patient searching for AdventHealth Hendersonville's ROI form could find this on adventhealth.com and submit it to the wrong facility, causing delays or confusion. The text explicitly says "I am a patient of St. Luke's Hospital."

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions:** The form does not state where to send or deliver it (no mailing address, fax number, or email for submissions — only the facility address "101 Hospital Drive, Columbus, NC 28722" in the header, which is the wrong facility for Hendersonville patients).
- **Email risk disclaimer is vague:** The form references "Guidelines for E-mail with Patients, provided separately if applicable" — a document that may or may not exist or be accessible to the patient.
- **"Written Proof May be Requested"** for personal representatives is vague about what constitutes acceptable proof.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Outdated branding:** The form still uses "St. Luke's Hospital" branding and has not been updated to reflect the AdventHealth rebrand. The form is dated **6/2016** — nearly 10 years old at time of evaluation.
- **Barcode artifact in text:** The extracted text contains `*1PRFA*` repeated twice, which appears to be a barcode identifier that renders as visible text in the PDF — a minor formatting artifact.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Patient-access-specific form:** Unlike many healthcare organizations that only provide a general third-party release form, this form is explicitly designed for patients requesting their own records. The title "Patient Request for Access" and the framing "If you would like a copy of your medical record" are clear and appropriate.
- **Multiple electronic format options:** Offering CD, Flash Drive, E-mail, and Paper copy — plus secure e-mail and fax delivery — gives patients genuine choice in how they receive their records. This is above average for ROI forms.
- **Granular record type selection:** The three-column layout (Hospital, Office/Clinic, Behavioral Health) with specific record types gives patients meaningful control over scope, rather than an all-or-nothing approach.
- **Single-page brevity:** The form accomplishes everything on one page without feeling like it's missing critical elements.
