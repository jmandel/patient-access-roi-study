# Arizona Community Physicians — Form 5 Evaluation

## Document: Minor Release of Information Form (form-5.pdf)

---

### 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Minor Release of Information Form** (Form 116, revised 03/21/2023) — a standing access designation form for pediatric patients. It allows a parent or guardian to specify who may access their child's medical records, transport the child to appointments, and receive detailed messages about appointments and test results.

This is **not** a traditional ROI/authorization form for requesting copies of medical records. Instead, it functions as a standing consent that governs ongoing access permissions — designating who can interact with the practice on behalf of the minor. It is the pediatric counterpart to form-3.pdf (the Adult Release of Information Form, also Form 116), mirroring its structure but adding minor-specific provisions: appointment transport permissions and the option for children aged 16+ to be seen without an adult present. Form-6.pdf is the Spanish-language version of this same form.

Among the seven forms found for Arizona Community Physicians, form-1.pdf is the primary general-purpose ROI authorization. Form-5 serves a complementary but distinct purpose — establishing who has standing permission to access information, rather than authorizing a one-time release.

### 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Format**: Single-page PDF, 144 KB — appropriate size for the content.
- **Text layer**: Present and complete (`has_text_layer: true`, `is_image_only_scan: false`). All text is extractable, as confirmed by the full text extraction in metadata (2,855 characters).
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). The form is a flat PDF designed for printing and hand-filling, with blank lines indicated by underscores (e.g., `Patient Name: _______________________________`).
- **Fonts**: 4 fonts used, suggesting some typographic hierarchy.
- **Digital-first design**: This is clearly a print-oriented document. There are no interactive elements, no clickable fields, and no electronic submission pathway mentioned. A patient must print, hand-fill, and physically deliver the form.

### 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportion**: One page covering access designations, transport permissions, voicemail permissions, exclusion directives, and unaccompanied minor consent. The content density is appropriate — it covers meaningful ground without being bloated.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical progression:
1. Patient identification (name, DOB, date, account #)
2. Parent/guardian contact information (2 slots)
3. Other authorized adults (2 slots)
4. Appointment transport permission (2 slots with name and relationship)
5. Voicemail/message permission (2 slots with name and phone number)
6. "Do Not Release" exclusion (2 name slots)
7. Unaccompanied minor consent (for children 16+, two initial lines)
8. Acknowledgment and signature

**Clarity**: The language is plain and accessible. The introductory text — "The confidentiality of our patient's medical information is very important to us. We understand there may be circumstances in which a family member or other adult needs access to your child's health information" — is patient-friendly. Instructions are straightforward.

**Notable content**: The "DO NOT RELEASE" section includes a parenthetical: "(Legal directive must be provided if parent or guardian)" — indicating the practice requires documentation if a parent/guardian is being excluded, which is contextually appropriate for custody situations.

The bottom note provides an important clinical clarification: "This is a general consent form and is not a substitute for separate written informed consent discussing risks, benefits, and possible side effects of treatment when required (e.g., invasive procedures and immunizations)."

**Field capacity**: The form provides limited slots — 2 parent/guardians, 2 other adults, 2 transport persons, 2 message recipients, 2 exclusions. For blended families or complex custody arrangements, this may be insufficient.

### 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Purpose alignment**: This form is narrowly focused on designating who can interact with the practice regarding a minor's care. It does not serve as a mechanism for requesting copies of medical records — for that, form-1.pdf is the appropriate document. The scope is described as "not limited to but may include appointments, billing information and test results."

**Revocation**: The form states "I acknowledge that the information above is accurate and that I may withdraw the terms of this agreement upon written notice" — revocation requires written notice, which is standard.

**Duration**: Unlike the adult version (form-3), which states "The information provided on this form will stay in effect until updated by the patient," form-5 does not explicitly state its duration. There is no expiration date field and no language about when the authorization lapses. This is an ambiguity.

**Unaccompanied minor provision**: The two-tiered consent for 16+ minors is thoughtful — separating general office visits from "minor procedures or immunizations" gives parents granular control. This reflects practical pediatric care needs.

**No electronic option**: There is no mention of electronic submission, email, fax, or patient portal. The form must be printed and delivered physically.

### 6. COMPLIANCE

**Scope**: This form governs access designation rather than records release, so traditional HIPAA Right of Access requirements (45 CFR § 164.524) are less directly applicable. However:

- No fees are mentioned (appropriate — this is not a records request form).
- No notarization is required.
- No unreasonable barriers to submission are stated (though the lack of electronic submission is a practical barrier).
- The form does not reference HIPAA or cite any regulatory authority.
- The "DO NOT RELEASE" provision requiring "Legal directive must be provided if parent or guardian" is reasonable in the context of custody disputes but could be burdensome if interpreted to require court documents merely to limit a parent's access in non-custody situations.

### 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

#### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **No stated duration/expiration**: Unlike the adult counterpart (form-3) which explicitly states the form "will stay in effect until updated by the patient," form-5 is silent on duration. A parent filling this out has no indication whether it remains effective indefinitely, expires annually, or must be renewed.
- **"Legal directive" requirement for parent exclusion**: The phrase "Legal directive must be provided if parent or guardian" in the DO NOT RELEASE section is undefined. It's unclear whether this means a court order, a notarized statement, or some other document. This could create confusion or barriers for parents in contentious custody situations.

#### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Two-tiered unaccompanied minor consent**: Separating "seen without an adult" from "minor procedures or immunizations without an adult" gives parents meaningful granularity — a parent might allow their 16-year-old to attend a check-up alone but want to be present for vaccinations.
- **Spanish-language version available**: Form-6 is a Spanish translation of this same form, demonstrating accessibility effort appropriate for a Tucson-area practice.
- **Clear clinical disclaimer**: The bottom note distinguishing this general consent from procedure-specific informed consent is a responsible inclusion that sets appropriate expectations.
