# Evaluation: Intermountain Medical Center — form-3.pdf

**Organization**: Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT)
**Parent System**: Intermountain Health
**Document**: "Patient Request for Health Information"
**Source URL**: https://prod.intermountainhealth.org/-/media/files/intermountain-health/for-patients/medical-records/request-records-for-yourself.ashx
**Date on form**: 06/2025 (form ID: A-MR-4000-0625)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3 is titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** — a dedicated patient self-access form, distinct from the two other forms found for this organization. Form-1 ("Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information," dated 5/2017) is an older legacy general-purpose ROI authorization. Form-2 ("Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)," dated 06/2025) is a newer fillable form specifically for third-party disclosure ("request records be sent to someone else"). Form-3 is the counterpart to form-2: it is specifically for patients requesting their own records.

The fact that Intermountain Health maintains separate forms for patient self-access versus third-party disclosure is significant — it means a patient requesting their own records uses a simpler, more focused form rather than navigating a general authorization designed for third-party releases. All three forms are system-wide (used across all Intermountain Health facilities), not specific to Intermountain Medical Center.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, all three forms were easy to find via standard web searches. Queries like `"Intermountain Healthcare medical records release form authorization PDF"` yielded direct download links. The forms were also discoverable via site-specific searches on `intermountainhealthcare.org`. No login, portal access, or JavaScript rendering was required — forms were directly downloadable as PDFs.

The source URL for form-3 (`prod.intermountainhealth.org/-/media/files/intermountain-health/for-patients/medical-records/request-records-for-yourself.ashx`) uses a descriptive path (`request-records-for-yourself`) that clearly signals its purpose. The retrieval difficulty was rated **easy** with no significant obstacles encountered.

One minor wrinkle: Intermountain Health operates across two domains — the legacy `intermountainhealthcare.org` and the current `prod.intermountainhealth.org`. Form-3 was found on the newer domain, while form-1 was on the legacy domain. This could confuse patients who land on the legacy site and only find the older general authorization form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

Form-3 is a well-constructed digital PDF:

- **Text layer**: Full extractable text (2,030 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: 48 interactive form fields — a high count for a single-page form, indicating comprehensive digitization of all input areas.
- **Print/Clear buttons**: The form includes "Print" and "Clear" buttons visible at the top, confirming interactive PDF functionality.
- **Page count**: 1 page — concise and efficient.
- **File size**: 93,025 bytes (~91 KB) — very compact for a fillable PDF.
- **Fonts**: 8 fonts embedded, suggesting intentional typographic design (headers, body, etc.).
- **Images**: 2 embedded images (likely the Intermountain Health logo and possibly a barcode/label area).
- **PDF version**: Not explicitly noted, but the presence of fillable fields and buttons indicates a modern PDF with AcroForm support.

This is clearly a **digital-first document**, not a scan of a paper form. It was designed to be filled on-screen and either submitted electronically or printed.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure and organization**: The form uses a clean 7-section numbered layout:

1. Patient Information (name, DOB, phone, email, address)
2. Which facility/clinic/doctor (source of records)
3. What records do you want (date range + record type checkboxes)
4. How do you want your records delivered (delivery method)
5. Where do you want your records sent (recipient details)
6. Signature block
7. Return instructions (with region-specific contacts)

This logical flow mirrors how a patient would think about the request: who am I → where are my records → what do I want → how do I want them → where to send them → sign → submit.

**Language clarity**: The form uses plain, direct language throughout. The title "Patient Request for Health Information" is clear and jargon-free. Instructions like "Please fill out all sections to avoid delay" are practical and patient-friendly. Section headings are phrased as questions ("What records do you want?", "How do you want your records delivered?"), which is more approachable than the typical bureaucratic style.

**Record type options**: The form provides 12 checkbox options for record types: Clinic Visit, History & Physical, Laboratory, Substance Use Treatment, Emergency Report, Discharge Summary, Imaging Report, Billing Record, Operative Report, Consultation, Cardiac Study/EKG, and Other. This is a well-curated list covering the most commonly requested record types.

**Length**: At 1 page and ~2,030 characters of text content, this is admirably concise. There is no dense legal boilerplate consuming space.

**Readability**: Based on the extracted text, the form avoids complex sentence structures and legal jargon. The most complex sentence is the footer note: "Intermountain Health recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of their health information."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Dedicated patient access form**: This is explicitly a patient self-access form, not a general third-party release. The title ("Patient Request for Health Information"), the URL path (`request-records-for-yourself`), and the content all confirm this. Section 5 defaults to "Self" as the first delivery option: "Intermountain Health should provide my records to: ☐ Self ☐ Personal Representative (indicated below) ☐ Other Designated Third Party."

**Delivery format options**: Section 4 offers three delivery methods:
- "Paper – Mail Delivery"
- "Paper – In-Person Pickup"
- "Electronic (email, USB, CD, portal, other), specify:"

The electronic option is notable for its breadth — it explicitly lists email, USB, CD, portal, and "other" as sub-options, giving the patient flexibility to specify their preferred electronic format. This goes beyond what many ROI forms offer.

**Scope control**: Patients can specify date ranges ("Date(s) of Service: through") and select specific record types via checkboxes, giving granular control over what is requested.

**HIPAA right of access**: The footer includes: "Intermountain Health recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of their health information." This is a brief but explicit acknowledgment of the patient's legal right. It does not cite the specific regulation (45 CFR § 164.524), though the older form-1 does.

**EHI export / bulk data**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, USCDI, or any ONC/21st Century Cures Act concepts.

**Submission options**: Section 7 provides multiple submission methods organized by state:
- CO, NV, MT, WY: Email (peaks_croi@imail.org), Fax (303-467-8966), or Mail
- UT, ID: Email (MedRecReq@r1rcm.com), Fax (385-215-7047), or Mail

Email submission is offered, which is a meaningful accessibility feature — patients can fill the form digitally and email it without printing or visiting in person.

**Fee disclosure**: The footer states: "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records." This is honest but vague — it does not specify what charges may apply or their amounts.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No notarization required**: The form requires only a signature; no notarization or witness is needed (contrast with form-1, which has an optional witness line).

**No in-person-only restriction**: Multiple remote submission methods are available (email, fax, mail).

**No expiration/auto-revocation clause**: Unlike form-2 (which auto-expires after 180 days), form-3 contains no expiration language. This makes sense — a patient access request is a one-time transaction, not an ongoing authorization.

**Fee language**: The statement "There may be charges" is permissible under HIPAA, which allows reasonable cost-based fees for copies. However, the lack of specificity could create uncertainty for patients who may be deterred by unknown costs.

**Third-party vendor involvement**: The UT/ID email address (`MedRecReq@r1rcm.com`) routes to R1 RCM, a third-party revenue cycle management company. While outsourcing ROI processing is common, patients may not realize their request is being handled by a vendor rather than Intermountain Health directly.

**No consent bundling**: The form is solely about accessing health information — it does not bundle in other authorizations or consent language.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated patient self-access form**: Intermountain Health is one of relatively few organizations that maintain a separate form specifically for patients requesting their own records, distinct from the third-party disclosure form. This avoids forcing patients through an authorization workflow designed for releasing records to others.
- **Question-based section headings**: Using "What records do you want?" and "How do you want your records delivered?" as section labels makes the form feel like a guided conversation rather than a bureaucratic checklist.
- **Electronic delivery as a named option**: Listing "Electronic (email, USB, CD, portal, other)" as a delivery format, with a free-text field for specification, gives patients genuine flexibility and signals that digital delivery is a normal, expected option.
- **Email submission accepted**: Patients can submit the completed form via email, removing the need for printing, scanning, faxing, or mailing.
- **Single-page, 48-field fillable PDF**: Packing a fully fillable form with comprehensive options into a single page is an impressive design achievement.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Vague fee language**: "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records" gives no indication of amount ranges. A patient cannot make an informed decision about whether to proceed without knowing approximate costs.
- **Third-party vendor routing not explained**: The UT/ID email address (`MedRecReq@r1rcm.com`) is a third-party vendor domain. Patients sending PHI-adjacent information (name, DOB, records requests) to an unfamiliar email domain may have legitimate concerns, and the form provides no explanation of who handles the request.
- **"Personal Representative" not defined**: Section 5 offers "Personal Representative" as a delivery target but does not explain what qualifies someone as a personal representative or what documentation may be required.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Dual-domain confusion**: The form is hosted on `prod.intermountainhealth.org` while older forms remain on `intermountainhealthcare.org`. The `prod.` prefix in the production domain name is unusual and may look suspicious or unofficial to patients.
