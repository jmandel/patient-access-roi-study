# Evaluation: HopeHealth — form-1.pdf (Notice of Privacy Practices)

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) or Authorization form. It is HopeHealth's **Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)** — a HIPAA-mandated document describing how the organization may use and disclose patient medical information. The document title is "NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES" and it opens with: *"This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information."*

It was downloaded from `https://www.hope-health.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices_26.pdf`, linked on HopeHealth's website. It took effect September 23, 2013 and was amended February 16, 2026.

This is one of two documents retrieved for HopeHealth. The other (form-2.pdf) is a generic HealthMark Group Medical Records Release Authorization form — not HopeHealth-branded and not linked from HopeHealth's website. Notably, **no HopeHealth-specific ROI/authorization form PDF exists online**. The organization has fully outsourced medical records requests to HealthMark Group's online Request Manager portal.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The NPP itself was findable on HopeHealth's website, linked from their resources pages. However, as noted in the retrieval notes, the search for an actual ROI form was extensive and ultimately unsuccessful. The medical records page at `https://www.hope-health.org/resources/medical-records/` directs patients to HealthMark Group's online portal rather than providing any downloadable authorization form. The Wayback Machine confirmed this approach has been consistent since at least 2020.

Since this document is an NPP rather than an ROI form, its findability as an ROI resource is essentially irrelevant — patients looking for a way to request their records would not find what they need by downloading this document. The NPP does, however, mention in Section 4 that patients have a right to *"Look at or get copies of your medical information"* and that they *"must make your request in writing"* — but it does not provide a form, a link to the HealthMark portal, or any specific instructions on how to initiate such a request.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (12,528 characters).
- **Fillable fields**: None (0 fields). This is expected for an informational notice.
- **Page count**: 1 page. The entire NPP is compressed onto a single page, which raises readability concerns (see Content Design below).
- **File size**: 237,690 bytes (~232 KB) — reasonable for a text-based single-page PDF.
- **Fonts**: 9 fonts used.
- **Embedded images**: None.
- **Scan status**: Not an image-only scan; it is a digitally-created document.

As a digital artifact, the document functions adequately — text is selectable and searchable. However, fitting 12,500+ characters of legal content onto a single page means the font size must be extremely small, likely well below 10pt, which significantly impacts readability on screen and when printed.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The NPP covers five numbered sections: (1) Our Pledge Regarding Medical Information, (2) Our Legal Duty, (3) Use and Disclosure of Your Medical Information, and (4) Your Individual Rights, and (5) Privacy Correspondence.

**Length vs. readability**: Compressing this volume of content onto a single page is a significant design problem. Standard NPP documents of similar scope typically run 4–8 pages. The 12,528 characters of text on one page means extremely dense formatting with minimal whitespace and very small font sizes.

**Language**: The document mixes plain-language explanations with legal terminology. The treatment/payment/operations section uses helpful concrete examples (e.g., *"You are in the hospital with a broken leg. You also have diabetes."*), which is a positive practice. However, the legal sections (law enforcement, specialized government functions, court orders) are dense and would challenge many readers.

**Organization**: The five-section structure is logical, progressing from organizational pledge → legal obligations → uses/disclosures → patient rights → contact information. Subsections within Section 3 are labeled by topic (Treatment, Payment, Health Care Operations, etc.), which aids navigation.

**Completeness**: The NPP covers standard categories including treatment, payment, operations, fundraising, research, law enforcement, public health, and disaster relief. It addresses substance use disorder (SUD) records and psychotherapy notes. The fundraising section includes opt-out information with a phone number: *"(888) 841-5855 and ask to speak to the Director of Corporate Compliance."*

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

As an NPP, this document serves an informational purpose rather than a transactional one. Evaluating it from the perspective of a patient trying to access their own records:

**Right of Access language**: Section 4 lists six patient rights, beginning with: *"Look at or get copies of your medical information. You may request that we provide copies in a format other than photocopies. We will use the format you request unless it is not practical for us to do so."* This references the right to choose format, which aligns with HIPAA § 164.524. However, it does not cite the regulation by number, does not mention fees, does not mention the 30-day response timeline, and does not reference electronic copies or patient portal access.

**Actionability gap**: The NPP tells patients they have the right to access records but provides no practical mechanism to exercise that right. It says *"You must make your request in writing"* and *"You may get the form to request access by using the contact information listed at the end of this notice"* — but the contact section (Section 5) provides only the Privacy Officer's phone number, email, and mailing address. There is no link to the HealthMark portal, no mention of the online request process, and no downloadable authorization form referenced.

**No mention of electronic delivery, patient portal, or EHI export.** The only format-related language is the general statement about requesting copies "in a format other than photocopies."

## 6. COMPLIANCE

This is an NPP rather than an authorization form, so standard ROI compliance concerns (notarization, in-person requirements, excessive fees, expiration periods) do not directly apply. However, several aspects of the NPP merit comment:

- **No fee disclosure**: The document does not disclose what fees, if any, HopeHealth charges for copies of medical records. HIPAA permits reasonable, cost-based fees for patient access requests, and best practice is to disclose these in the NPP or related materials.
- **No timeline disclosure**: The NPP does not mention the 30-day (extendable to 60-day) response window required by HIPAA for access requests.
- **Vague request process**: Telling patients to make requests "in writing" and referencing a form available via "the contact information listed at the end" — when the contact section doesn't include a form or portal link — creates a dead end.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No accessible ROI pathway documented**: Despite HopeHealth having outsourced records requests to HealthMark Group, neither this NPP nor the website's medical records page provides a clear, complete pathway for patients to request their records. The HealthMark portal requires email verification, and the NPP doesn't mention the portal at all.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Circular reference for access form**: Section 4 states patients can *"get the form to request access by using the contact information listed at the end of this notice"* — but Section 5 lists only a phone number, email address, and mailing address. There is no form to "get" at these contacts, and no URL is provided. A patient reading this would reasonably expect a form to exist at those contact points.
- **"We will make every effort to obtain your consent each and every time"**: Section 1 states this pledge, but the NPP then enumerates extensive categories of permissible use/disclosure without consent. This could confuse patients about when consent is actually required.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **"HIPPA" typo in contact email**: The Privacy Officer's email is listed as `HIPPA@hope-health.org`. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is misspelled as "HIPPA." This is a notable error in a privacy compliance document, potentially undermining patient confidence. It may also mean emails sent to the correct spelling (`HIPAA@hope-health.org`) would fail to deliver if only the misspelled address is configured.
- **Incomplete bullet points under Payment**: The "For Payment" section contains two bullet points, but the second bullet appears to begin with `•` characters on otherwise blank lines in the extracted text, suggesting possible formatting or content issues in the original document.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Concrete examples for permitted uses**: The document includes relatable examples of how medical information might be shared (broken leg + diabetes scenario, sinus infection for billing), which is a patient-friendly practice that many NPPs lack.
- **SUD and psychotherapy notes addressed**: The NPP specifically addresses substance use disorder records and psychotherapy notes, stating: *"Your SUD treatment records will not be used or disclosed in any legal proceedings against you unless you give your written consent, or we receive a court order."* This is an important protection that many NPPs omit.
- **Fundraising opt-out included**: The NPP provides a clear opt-out mechanism for fundraising communications, including a phone number and contact role.
