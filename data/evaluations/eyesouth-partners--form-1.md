---

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "MEDICAL INFORMATION RELEASE FORM" from Center for Sight, an EyeSouth Partners affiliate operating in southwest Florida (Venice, Sarasota, Naples, Englewood, North Port, University Park). It is branded to Center for Sight, not to EyeSouth Partners — the parent organization's name does not appear anywhere in the extracted text. The document number "103-0820" suggests an internal form code with an August 2020 revision.

A second form (form-2.pdf) was retrieved from Georgia Retina, another EyeSouth affiliate. That form is more detailed and HIPAA-aware, titled "Authorization for Use, Release, or Request of Your Health Information." No centralized ROI form was found on the EyeSouth Partners corporate website itself.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **not findable through EyeSouth Partners directly**. The corporate website (eyesouthpartners.com) has no patient-facing forms section, no medical records page, and no downloadable ROI form. The privacy policy directs patients to write to the Privacy Officer but does not link to any authorization form.

The form was located only by searching affiliated practice websites individually. It was found on centerforsight.net, a Florida affiliate. Direct searches for EyeSouth Partners ROI forms returned nothing (`"EyeSouth Partners" "authorization" "release" "health information" filetype:pdf` — no results).

A patient seeking their records from EyeSouth Partners would need to:
1. Know which specific affiliated practice treated them
2. Find that practice's individual website
3. Locate the form there (if one exists — not all affiliates offer downloadable forms)

This multi-step, knowledge-dependent process is a significant barrier. The URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/103-0820-Medical-Info-Release-CFS_AMARA.pdf`) is a generic WordPress upload path, not descriptive or discoverable.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (2,060 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (0) interactive form fields. Despite having a text layer, the PDF contains no fillable fields — patients must print and handwrite entries.
- **File size**: 94,858 bytes (~93 KB) for a single page, which is reasonable.
- **Embedded images**: 61 images in a single-page document — an unusually high count, suggesting the layout is composed of many small image elements (possibly graphical elements, logos, or decorative borders) rather than being cleanly constructed.
- **Font count**: 5 fonts.
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is designed as a print-and-fill document. The zero fillable fields and the instruction-oriented layout (signature line, date line) confirm a paper-first approach.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page — appropriately concise for a basic records release form.

**Clarity**: The language is plain and accessible. Sentences are short and direct: "I authorize the release of information including diagnosis, records; examination rendered to me and claims information." The closing line — "At Center For Sight, we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care. Please allow 10 business days for processing your request." — is patient-friendly.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical top-down flow:
1. Patient Information (Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Phone, DOB)
2. Request Medical Information FROM (Center for Sight or Other)
3. Send Medical Information TO (with 11 Center for Sight locations listed with full addresses, phone/fax numbers)
4. Date range for records
5. Reason for request (checkboxes)
6. Authorization statement
7. Signature and date

**Layout concerns**: The listing of 11 Center for Sight locations with full addresses and fax numbers consumes a substantial portion of the single page. This is useful for fax-based submission but visually dense. The reasons checkboxes include: "Moving out of the area," "Insurance Change," "Change of provider," "Primary physician needs records," "Copy for northern physician," and "Other."

**Readability**: Text appears readable based on the font count and layout structure, though the 61 embedded images may add visual clutter.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is structured bidirectionally — it can be used to request records FROM Center for Sight or to send records TO Center for Sight. However, it does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records (HIPAA Right of Access) and a third-party release authorization. The title "Medical Information Release Form" and the authorization language ("I authorize the release of information") frame this as a generic release.

**Scope options**: Limited. The form allows specifying a date range ("during the period from ___ to ___") but provides no checkboxes or options for specific record types (e.g., lab results, imaging, clinical notes). The authorization broadly covers "diagnosis, records; examination rendered to me and claims information."

**Format/delivery options**: None specified. The form does not offer electronic delivery, email, patient portal access, or any choice of format. The listing of fax numbers for each location implies fax is the expected delivery/submission mechanism.

**Right of Access language**: Absent. No mention of HIPAA, 45 CFR § 164.524, patient rights, or any legal framework. No mention of fees, timelines mandated by law, or the patient's right to receive records in their preferred format.

**EHI Export awareness**: None.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: The form states "This Release of Information will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing." This is an indefinite authorization with no automatic expiration — unusual and potentially problematic. HIPAA requires an expiration date or event for valid authorizations (45 CFR § 164.508(c)(1)(v)), though this requirement technically applies to authorizations under § 164.508, not necessarily to patient access requests under § 164.524.

**Fee disclosure**: No mention of fees. This is neutral — neither good nor bad, but patients receive no information about potential costs.

**Submission method**: The form lists fax numbers for each location, implying fax submission is available. No explicit statement about accepted submission methods (mail, fax, in-person, email).

**Revocation**: Only "terminated by me in writing" — no specific instructions on how to terminate, who to contact, or where to send the revocation.

**Missing elements**: No witness or notarization requirements (positive). No mention of representative authorization beyond the signature line labeled "Patient or Legal Representative."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Indefinite authorization with no expiration**: "This Release of Information will remain in effect until terminated by me in writing" creates an open-ended authorization. While this benefits convenience, it could also lead to ongoing disclosures the patient has forgotten about. For a valid HIPAA authorization under § 164.508, an expiration date or event is required.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No distinction between patient access and third-party release**: The form conflates a patient's Right of Access request with a general authorization to release records. A patient requesting their own records has different legal protections (shorter timelines, fee limits, no requirement for a "reason") than a third-party release.
- **"Copy for northern physician"** as a checkbox reason is oddly specific and regionally colloquial — presumably referring to snowbird patients who split time between Florida and northern states. While charming, it may confuse patients who don't fit this pattern.
- **Unclear submission process**: Fax numbers are listed but it's not stated whether the form should be faxed, mailed, or delivered in person.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Semicolon in authorization text**: "I authorize the release of information including diagnosis, records; examination rendered to me" — the semicolon creates a grammatically awkward construction. It likely should read "diagnosis, records, and examinations rendered to me."

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Concise one-page design**: The form is appropriately brief for its purpose, avoiding unnecessary legal boilerplate.
- **10 business day processing commitment**: "Please allow 10 business days for processing your request" sets a clear expectation, and 10 business days is within HIPAA's 30-day window.
- **Patient-friendly closing**: "At Center For Sight, we consider it a privilege to be entrusted with your care" is a warm, humanizing touch rarely seen on ROI forms.
