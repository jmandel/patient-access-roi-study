# Evaluation: Canton-Potsdam Hospital — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**Document type:** Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)

This is **not** a Release of Information or authorization form. It is the HIPAA-required Notice of Privacy Practices for St. Lawrence Health System, effective July 11, 2016. The document is titled "NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES" and opens with: "THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU CAN BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION."

**Relationship to other documents:** This is the third of three documents retrieved for Canton-Potsdam Hospital / St. Lawrence Health System. The other two are:
- form-1.pdf: A COVID-specific pre-filled OCA-960 authorization form (image-only scan, 1 page)
- form-2.pdf: A blank OCA-960 authorization form (2 pages, garbled text extraction)

Neither of the other two documents is a custom, organization-specific ROI form either — they are generic New York State OCA Official Form No. 960 templates. form-3.pdf is a fundamentally different document type (privacy notice vs. authorization form) and would not be used by a patient to request their records. However, it does contain information about patient access rights and references the Medical Records Office as the point of contact for record requests.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This document was **not findable on the current website**. It was retrieved exclusively via the Wayback Machine from the archived stlawrencehealthsystem.org domain. The original URL was:
`https://www.stlawrencehealthsystem.org/-/media/slh/patients-and-visitors/slhs-notice-of-privacy-practices-11921.pdf`

The St. Lawrence Health System website now redirects to rochesterregional.org (the parent Rochester Regional Health system). There is no evidence that this NPP is currently hosted at any live URL. The current Rochester Regional Health medical records page explicitly excludes St. Lawrence Health facilities from its online records request tool, stating: "St. Lawrence Health is not currently available through this application, for information on requesting these records call (315) 769-4386."

This means a patient of Canton-Potsdam Hospital today cannot find this document online at all. They must call the phone number to learn about record request procedures.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present and clean. The full text extracted via pdftotext is 22,649 characters and is highly readable, in contrast to form-2.pdf which has severely garbled text due to font encoding issues.

**Fillable fields:** Zero. This is expected for an NPP — it is an informational document, not a form to be filled out.

**File format:** 364,929 bytes across 7 pages (~52 KB/page). The document has 47 embedded fonts, which is unusually high for a 7-page document and may indicate complex formatting or poor font subsetting. There are 2 embedded images (likely a logo or header graphic). The document is digitally produced (not a scan).

**Digital-first design:** Yes — the document was clearly created digitally with clean text rendering. It is not a scan of a paper document. The text is well-structured with headers, bullet points, and numbered sections that extract cleanly.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 7 pages, with the final page (page 7) containing only a brief note: "A copy of this Notice of Privacy Practices is available at the registration desk." The substantive content spans 6 pages. For a Notice of Privacy Practices covering all HIPAA-required elements, this is a typical length.

**Clarity:** The language is reasonably clear for a legal/regulatory document. It uses some plain-language explanations and provides concrete examples throughout, such as: "Jane is a patient at the health department. The receptionist may use medical information about Jane when setting up an appointment." These "Jane" examples appear in the Treatment, Payment, Healthcare Operations, and Persons Involved in Your Care sections and make abstract concepts more tangible.

**Organization:** The document follows a logical structure:
1. Introduction and legal obligations
2. Uses and disclosures (Treatment, Payment, Operations, Persons Involved, Required by Law, National Priorities, Authorizations)
3. Patient rights (8 enumerated rights)
4. Complaint procedures

Each section is clearly labeled with bold/capitalized headers. The numbered rights section (1-8) is particularly well-organized.

**Readability:** Text appears to be in standard readable font sizes. The document uses bullet points and numbered lists effectively to break up dense content.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**As an NPP, not an ROI form:** This document is not designed for patients to request records. However, it does describe record access rights in Section 2 under "YOU HAVE RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU":

> "You have the right to inspect (which means see or review) and receive a copy of medical information about you that we maintain in certain groups of records. If we maintain your medical records in an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, you may obtain an electronic copy of your medical records. You may also instruct us in writing to send an electronic copy of your medical records to a third party."

This is a meaningful mention of electronic access rights and EHR-based records. The document explicitly tells patients they can get electronic copies and direct records to third parties in writing — language that aligns well with HIPAA Right of Access requirements.

**Access process described:** The NPP directs patients to the Medical Records Office for Access Request Forms, Amendment Request Forms, Accounting Request Forms, and Alternative Contact Request Forms. This is helpful guidance but all of these forms are only "available from our Medical Records Office" — none are available online.

**Fees:** The document mentions fees in the access section: "If you would like a copy of the medical information about you, we will charge you a fee to cover the costs of the copy. Our fees for electronic copies of your medical records will be limited to the direct labor costs associated with fulfilling your request." This accurately reflects HIPAA fee limitations for electronic copies.

**Privacy Officer contact:** The document provides a consistent contact: Privacy Officer at (315) 261-6002, referenced multiple times throughout.

**Complaint process:** Clear instructions for filing complaints both internally (St. Lawrence Health System Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer, Canton-Potsdam Hospital, 50 Leroy Street, Potsdam, NY 13676) and with the federal government (OCR, with address, phone, website, and email).

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**As an NPP:** The document appears to cover the required elements of a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, including uses and disclosures, patient rights, breach notification obligations, and complaint procedures.

**Outdated references:** The document is effective July 11, 2016, which is nearly 10 years old. It references "www.StLawrenceHealthSystem.org" as the website where the current notice can be found, but this domain now redirects to rochesterregional.org. The complaint mailing address still references "St. Lawrence Health System" at Canton-Potsdam Hospital, which may or may not still be valid given the organizational absorption into Rochester Regional Health.

**Fee language:** The statement that "Our fees for electronic copies of your medical records will be limited to the direct labor costs associated with fulfilling your request" is consistent with the HIPAA Right of Access final rule. However, the document also mentions "possible additional fees" for summaries or explanations, which is permitted but could be clearer about the distinction.

**No unreasonable barriers detected** in the NPP language itself regarding record access, though the requirement to submit requests "in writing" and obtain forms from the Medical Records Office (rather than online) creates practical friction.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- The document references forms (Access Request Form, Amendment Request Form, Accounting Request Form, Alternative Contact Request Form, Authorization Revocation Form) that are "available from our Medical Records Office" or "Privacy Officer" but none appear to be available online. A patient reading this document would not know how to obtain these forms without visiting in person or calling.
- The relationship between St. Lawrence Health System and Rochester Regional Health is not addressed in this document. A patient encountering this NPP today would not understand the current organizational structure or whether these policies still apply.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Stale website reference:** The document directs patients to "www.StLawrenceHealthSystem.org" for the current NPP, but this domain redirects to rochesterregional.org, where no SLH-specific NPP appears to be hosted. This broken reference means the document's own update mechanism is non-functional.
- **Outdated organizational identity:** The document is branded as "St. Lawrence Health System" throughout, but this entity has been absorbed into Rochester Regional Health. The NPP may no longer reflect current organizational practices, policies, or contact information.
- **OCR complaint URL:** The document provides `http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/complaints/index.html` — this uses HTTP (not HTTPS) and may have changed since 2016.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Concrete examples throughout:** The "Jane" examples used in sections 1-4 (Treatment, Payment, Operations, Persons Involved in Care) are an effective plain-language technique that makes abstract HIPAA concepts accessible to patients. This is notably better than most NPPs which rely purely on legal/regulatory language.
- **Electronic access rights clearly stated:** The document explicitly mentions EHR-based electronic copies and the right to direct electronic copies to third parties, which many NPPs omit or obscure.
- **Fee limitation for electronic copies:** The document specifically calls out that electronic copy fees are "limited to the direct labor costs" — an accurate and patient-friendly statement of HIPAA limitations.
