## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-4.pdf is the **current English-language version** (dated 09/2025) of Blessing Health System's general authorization for release of medical information. It is a 2-page document: page 1 is the authorization form itself, page 2 provides line-by-line "Guidelines for Completing" the form.

Five forms were retrieved for this organization:

- **form-1.pdf** and **form-2.pdf**: April 2023 English versions (nearly identical; form-1 has a "Medical Record Number" header, form-2 does not). Both include a **witness signature requirement** that form-4 removes.
- **form-3.pdf**: An older undated version (revised 8/2015) with a different layout listing specific Blessing facilities (Blessing Hospital, Blessing Physician Services, Blessing Walk-In, Illini Community Hospital) and separating record types into "Hospital Setting" and "Office Setting" categories.
- **form-4.pdf** (this document): The current September 2025 English version, linked from the website's Medical Records page.
- **form-5.pdf**: The September 2025 Spanish translation of this form, also currently linked from the website.

Form-4 represents the most recent iteration, with a notable improvement: the removal of the witness signature requirement that appeared in the April 2023 versions. The form is managed through PolicyStat (official copy at https://blessing-forms.policystat.com/), indicating centralized document control.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form is **easy to find**. Per the retrieval notes, the form was located through multiple independent methods:

- **Direct web search** for Blessing Hospital authorization forms immediately returned PDF links.
- **Site-specific search** (`site:blessinghealth.org authorization release medical records`) surfaced both English and Spanish forms.
- **Website navigation** at https://www.blessinghealth.org/medicalrecords leads to the form under a clear path: For Patients → Request Medical Records.

The URL is descriptive (`BH_Authorize_Release_Of_Medical_Records_9-2025.pdf`), including the organization abbreviation, document purpose, and version date. The medical records page is described as "well-organized" in retrieval notes.

One minor concern: multiple older versions of the form remain accessible at their original URLs (the April 2023 and 2015 versions were all still downloadable). A patient arriving via an older search result or cached link could submit an outdated form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (6,188 characters across 2 pages). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite having 7 embedded fonts and a clean digital layout, the PDF contains no interactive form fields. All blank lines (name, date of birth, addresses, dates, phone numbers) must be filled by hand after printing.
- **File size:** 271 KB for 2 pages with 2 embedded images — reasonable for a non-fillable PDF.
- **Design origin:** This is a digitally-authored document (not a scan), but it is designed as a **print-and-fill form**. Instructions like "(Circle) Pick up or Mail or Fax or Email" and "(Circle) yes no" are explicitly print-oriented interactions. Checkboxes for record types and sensitive information categories are not interactive.
- **PDF version / fonts:** 7 fonts embedded, indicating proper typographic control. The document renders cleanly.

The form is technically competent as a print artifact but entirely non-interactive digitally. A patient downloading this form must print it, fill it by hand, sign it physically, and then deliver it (by mail, fax, or in person).

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality:** 2 pages is reasonable — page 1 for the authorization, page 2 for completion guidelines. The guidelines page is a genuinely useful addition that walks through each field.

**Structure and organization:** The form follows a logical flow: patient demographics → release from/to → record types → sensitive information consent → purpose → revocation rights → expiration → signature. Sections are visually delineated with bold headers ("RELEASE RECORDS FROM:", "RECORDS GOING TO:", "Sensitive Medical Information").

**Record type granularity:** The form offers 15 specific record type checkboxes plus an "Other" field:
- Continuing Care Abstract, Discharge Summary, Radiology Reports, Immunization Records, History and Physical, Radiology Images, Operative Reports, Consultations, Therapy Notes, Physical Forms, Emergency Department Records, Cardiology Reports, Workability or School Release Forms, Laboratory and Pathology Reports, Office Notes.

This is a good level of specificity, though the descriptions are clinical rather than plain-language.

**Language clarity:** The form uses a mix of plain language and legal phrasing. The authorization statement ("I authorize the use or disclosure of the above named individual's health information, its employees and agents, to furnish") is grammatically awkward — "its employees and agents" appears to modify "health information" rather than the organization, creating ambiguity about who is authorized. The re-disclosure warning is dense but substantively complete.

**Guidelines page:** The page 2 guidelines are written in plain, helpful language. Entries like "Date of records needed, this can be a date range (i.e. '1999 to present', or specific lab report on 06/01/12.)" provide concrete examples. The "Expiration" guidance is clear: "Any date can be written here. If left blank, 6 months will apply."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a **general-purpose authorization form**, not specifically designed for patient access to their own records. The bidirectional "RELEASE RECORDS FROM" / "RECORDS GOING TO" structure is oriented toward third-party disclosures. However, the purpose checkboxes include "Personal reasons" and "Transferring care," which at least accommodate patient-initiated requests.

**Delivery options:** The form offers four delivery methods: "Pick up or Mail or Fax or Email." Email is included, which is better than many ROI forms. However, there is no mention of secure electronic delivery, patient portal access, or EHI export options. The form warns that "Electronic images/records (i.e. Radiology) on CD/USB media are not encrypted or password-protected" and that "Unencrypted CD/USB media cannot be mailed by Blessing," which suggests physical media delivery exists but is constrained.

**Scope options:** Patients can specify date ranges (marked "MUST specify date range"), select from 15 record type categories, and separately authorize sensitive information categories (Mental Health, Genetic Testing, STD/AIDS/HIV, Drugs/Alcohol). This is granular and allows tailored requests.

**HIPAA Right of Access:** The form does **not** reference HIPAA § 164.524 or explicitly state the patient's right of access. It mentions that authorization is voluntary and that treatment/payment are not conditioned on signing, which addresses HIPAA's anti-conditioning requirement — but it does not educate patients about their specific right to obtain their own records.

**EHI Export / bulk data:** No mention.

**Fees:** The form itself does not disclose fees. The retrieval notes mention a $6.50 flat fee for certain record requests, but this is not stated on the form.

**Photo ID:** The form states "I understand photo identification may be required to obtain medical records" — the hedged "may be required" language is less burdensome than a strict mandate but still ambiguous about when ID would be needed.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Witness requirement removed:** The September 2025 version notably removes the "Witness signature is required below" requirement that existed in the April 2023 versions (form-1 and form-2). This is a positive change — witness requirements for routine record requests exceed HIPAA requirements and create unnecessary barriers.

**Expiration:** Default of 6 months if not specified. "This Authorization is only valid for existing records. Future services will need a new Authorization." The 6-month default is reasonable and standard.

**Conditioning:** The form correctly states: "Healthcare treatment, payment, enrollment in the health plan, or eligibility for benefits is not conditioned on signing the Authorization."

**Revocation rights:** Clearly stated: "I understand I have the right to revoke this Authorization at any time. I understand if I revoke this Authorization, I must do so in writing and present my written revocation to the Health Information Management Department."

**Sensitive information handling:** Separate authorization for mental health, genetic testing, STD/AIDS/HIV, and drugs/alcohol records — consistent with Illinois state law requirements (Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act). Minors age 12+ in Illinois must sign for sensitive information release, which is correctly noted.

**No notarization required.** No in-person-only submission requirement — multiple submission channels implied by the contact information (mailing addresses, fax numbers, phone numbers for three locations).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Witness requirement removed** in this version compared to the April 2023 forms — demonstrates active form improvement and barrier reduction.
- **Spanish language version available** (form-5.pdf) as a companion document, both currently linked from the website.
- **Page 2 guidelines** provide plain-language, field-by-field instructions with concrete examples — a genuinely helpful addition that most organizations omit.
- **Email as a delivery option** listed alongside pickup, mail, and fax — more accessible than many comparable forms.
- **PolicyStat document management** (ID: 18929997) suggests systematic version control and governance of the form.
- **Multiple submission locations** provided (Blessing Health System in Quincy, Blessing Health Hannibal, and Denman Services) with full mailing address, phone, and fax for each.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Authorization statement grammar:** "I authorize the use or disclosure of the above named individual's health information, its employees and agents, to furnish" — the phrase "its employees and agents" is syntactically misplaced, making it unclear whether the organization or the health information has employees and agents.
- **Photo ID language:** "I understand photo identification may be required" — unclear under what circumstances ID would or would not be required, leaving this to staff discretion.
- **"Call when ready?" field** appears to let the patient request a phone call when records are ready, but its relationship to the selected delivery method is unexplained — does it apply to pickup only, or to all methods?

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **No fee disclosure on the form itself.** Retrieval notes mention a $6.50 flat fee, but the form gives patients no information about potential costs. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, patients are entitled to know about fees before authorizing, and fees must be limited to reasonable cost-based amounts.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Stale older versions remain accessible.** The April 2023 (form-1, form-2) and 2015 (form-3) versions are still downloadable at their original URLs. The 2023 versions still impose a witness requirement that the current version intentionally removed. A patient finding an old version via web search would face a barrier the organization has already decided to eliminate.
