# Evaluation: East Georgia Healthcare Center — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)** — not a Release of Information or authorization form. It is the HIPAA-mandated privacy notice (required by 45 CFR § 164.520) describing how East Georgia Healthcare Center uses and discloses protected health information. The title reads: "NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES" with the subtitle: "THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY."

In the context of the three documents found for EGHC:
- **form-1.pdf**: Medical Records Release form (English) — oriented toward *incoming* records from other providers to EGHC
- **form-2.pdf**: Medical Records Release form (Spanish) — Spanish version of form-1
- **form-3.pdf** (this document): Notice of Privacy Practices — informational document, not a patient-actionable authorization form

This document is supplementary context for patients seeking to understand their rights. It is not designed for submitting a records request.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The NPP was directly downloadable as a PDF from the EGHC forms page (https://eghc.org/forms/) at a stable WordPress URL: `https://eghc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EGHC-Notice-of-Privacy.pdf`. Unlike the ROI forms (form-1 and form-2), which required navigating through RightSignature's e-signature platform, this document was a straightforward link. Per the notes, both English and Spanish versions of the NPP are available on the forms page.

The findability for this particular document is reasonable: it lives on a dedicated forms page accessible from the main website. However, there is no obvious "Patient Rights" or "Privacy" section on the website — it is grouped with all other patient forms.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Strengths:**
- Has a real text layer (unlike form-1 and form-2, which are image-only scans). Full text is extractable (7,691 characters).
- Small file size (22,397 bytes / ~22 KB) — loads quickly.
- Uses 4 fonts, no embedded images — clean digital-native PDF.
- Not a scan; no OCR issues.

**Weaknesses:**
- Single page only — all content is compressed into one page. At ~7,700 characters this means extremely small text or very dense formatting.
- Zero fillable fields (expected for an informational document, but means there's no interactive acknowledgment mechanism).
- No bookmarks, table of contents, or internal navigation (though at one page, this is less critical).

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The document covers the standard NPP topics in a single page:

- Uses and disclosures (Payment, Treatment, Health Care Operations)
- Appointment and health reminders
- Who follows the notice
- Policy regarding protection of personal information
- Individual rights (inspect/copy, amend, request restrictions, restrict health plan disclosures, confidential communications, accounting of disclosures)
- Changes to the notice
- Complaints procedure
- Other uses of medical information

**Layout and readability concerns:**
- Cramming all NPP content into a single page results in a wall of text. There are section headers in all-caps, but no visual hierarchy, bullet points, or whitespace to help patients parse the information.
- The language is moderately bureaucratic but not egregiously so. Phrases like "we will elaborate on the meaning and provide more specific examples, if you request" attempt accessibility.
- No plain-language summary or "your rights at a glance" section.

**Notable content details:**
- Mentions Title X Family Planning Program participation: "East Georgia Healthcare Center is a sub-recipient of the Title X Family Planning Program. Participation in this program is strictly voluntary and may be strictly confidential at your request."
- Privacy Officer identified by name: "Linda Braswell, Privacy Officer, (478) 237-6262 x 1504 215 N. Coleman Dr., Swainsboro, GA 30401."
- The "Right to Inspect and Copy" section states: "You have the right to inspect and copy medical information that may be used to make decisions about your care. We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain very limited circumstances." This is vague — it does not describe what those circumstances are, nor does it mention fees, timelines, or format options.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This document is an informational notice, not an actionable form. For a patient trying to access their records, it provides:

- **Confirmation of the right**: "You have the right to inspect and copy medical information that may be used to make decisions about your care."
- **No actionable instructions**: There is no guidance on *how* to request records — no mention of which form to use, where to submit a request, expected turnaround time, or applicable fees.
- **Complaint pathway**: The document tells patients they can file complaints with the Privacy Officer (with contact info) or with HHS, though it does not provide HHS contact information.
- **Revocation of authorization**: Notes that patients "may revoke that permission, in writing, at any time" for voluntary disclosures.

A patient reading this document would learn they have rights but would not learn how to exercise them through EGHC's processes. There is a disconnect: the NPP references the right to inspect and copy, but the only ROI form available (form-1) is designed for *incoming* records from other providers, not for patient self-access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Present:**
- Covers required NPP content areas (uses/disclosures, patient rights, complaint process)
- Names the Privacy Officer with contact details
- Mentions the right to restrict disclosures to health plans for self-pay items (HITECH Act requirement)
- States patients will not be penalized for filing complaints

**Missing or concerning:**
- **No effective date**: HIPAA requires NPPs to include an effective date (45 CFR § 164.520(b)(1)(viii)). None is present in the extracted text.
- **No breach notification right**: The HITECH Act (2009) requires NPPs to include a statement about patients' right to be notified of breaches of unsecured PHI. This document does not mention breach notification.
- **HHS complaint contact missing**: The document states patients may file complaints "with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services" but provides no address, phone number, or URL for doing so. HIPAA requires the NPP to include information about how to file such complaints.
- **No mention of fees for copies**: The right to inspect and copy section does not address whether fees will be charged, which leaves patients uninformed about potential costs.
- **No mention of electronic copies**: Post-HITECH, patients have the right to request electronic copies of their records. This is not referenced.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Right to inspect and copy is hedged without explanation**: The document states EGHC "may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain very limited circumstances" without identifying those circumstances. While HIPAA does permit narrow denial grounds, the lack of specificity here — combined with no mention of an appeal or review process — could discourage patients from pursuing access.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Disconnect between NPP and available forms**: The NPP tells patients they have the right to inspect and copy their records, but the only authorization form available on the website (form-1) is designed for transferring records *from other providers to EGHC*, not for patients requesting their own records *from* EGHC. A patient following the NPP's guidance would have no clear form to use for self-access.
- **"We may deny your request for an amendment"** — stated without explaining the grounds for denial or the patient's right to submit a statement of disagreement, which HIPAA requires.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Missing effective date**: A required element under 45 CFR § 164.520(b)(1)(viii). The document has no date of any kind in the extracted text.
- **Missing breach notification language**: Required under the HITECH Act since 2009. The NPP predates or ignores this requirement.
- **Missing HHS contact information**: The NPP references the right to complain to HHS but provides no contact details, making it difficult for patients to act on this right.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Title X confidentiality notice**: The inclusion of language about Title X Family Planning Program confidentiality ("may be strictly confidential at your request") is a thoughtful addition for an FQHC serving a population that may particularly value reproductive health privacy.
- **Available in Spanish**: Per the notes and forms page, the NPP is available in both English and Spanish, which is important for the patient population served by this FQHC.
- **Direct PDF download**: Unlike the ROI forms (which require navigating RightSignature), the NPP is a clean, direct PDF download with a real text layer — the most technically accessible document in EGHC's set.
