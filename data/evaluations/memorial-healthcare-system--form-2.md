# Memorial Healthcare System — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**Form title:** "Autorización para la divulgación de registros médicos confidenciales" (Authorization for Release of Confidential Medical Records — Spanish version)

**Document number:** 2310-10174 (05/21)

This is the **Spanish-language translation** of the same ROI authorization form available in English as form-1.pdf (document number 2310-10173). Memorial Healthcare System provides this form in three languages: English (form-1), Spanish (form-2), and Haitian Creole (form-3). A fourth document (form-4) is a separate Request for Amendment of Protected Health Information form and is unrelated to the ROI process.

The form is structurally identical to the English version — same numbered sections (1–5), same facility checkboxes, same record type options, same acknowledgment statements (a–h). It is a direct translation, not a separately designed form.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The Spanish form was found on the Memorial Healthcare System medical records page at `https://www.mhs.net/patients-and-visitors/medical-records`, which is linked from the main "Patients & Visitors" navigation. The retrieval notes characterize difficulty as **"Easy"** — the PDF was directly downloadable without login, CAPTCHA, or bot blocking.

The URL is descriptive: `https://www.mhs.net/-/media/mhs/files/patients-and-visitors/2310-10174-authorization-for-release-of-confidential-medical-records-spanish.pdf`. The filename explicitly identifies it as the Spanish version. However, the URL uses an internal document number (2310-10174) as the primary identifier, which is less user-friendly than a plain-language slug.

For a Spanish-speaking patient, findability depends on whether the medical records webpage itself has Spanish-language navigation or labels pointing to this form. The PDF link exists on the English-language page, so a patient would need to navigate in English to locate the Spanish download.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size:** 709,077 bytes (~709 KB) for a 2-page document. This is moderately large for 2 pages of text, suggesting embedded images or graphics (the metadata reports 9 embedded images).
- **Text layer:** Present. The full extracted text (4,599 characters) is coherent and well-structured, indicating a digitally composed PDF — not a scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (0). Despite having clear input areas (patient name, date of birth, facility checkboxes, record type checkboxes, signature fields), the form has no interactive fields. Patients must print and handwrite.
- **Font count:** 6 fonts, suggesting intentional typographic design.
- **Page count:** 2 pages.
- **Image-only scan:** No — this is a digitally authored document with proper text layer.

The form is a flat PDF designed for print-and-fill workflow. While the text layer means it is searchable and screen-reader accessible at a basic level, the lack of any fillable fields is a significant barrier. The English version (form-1) also has zero fillable fields, so this is consistent across all language versions.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure:** The form follows a logical 5-section flow:
1. Facility selection (14 checkbox options including "Todas las instalaciones de Memorial Healthcare System" and "Otro (especificar)")
2. Patient identification (name, date of birth)
3. Record type selection (~15 specific record categories with checkboxes, plus date-of-service fields)
4. Recipient information (name, address, email)
5. Acknowledgment statements (a–h) and signature block

**Clarity of translation:** The Spanish text reads as a professional translation. Key terms are rendered appropriately — e.g., "Resumen del alta" (Discharge Summary), "Sala de urgencias" (Emergency Room), "Informes de anatomía patológica" (Pathology Reports). Medical terminology is preserved where Spanish equivalents exist.

**Length:** At 2 pages with 4,599 characters of extracted text, the form is proportionate to its content. It covers all necessary authorization elements without excessive padding.

**Acknowledgment statements:** Section 5 contains 8 acknowledgment clauses (a–h) covering revocation rights, expiration, sensitive information categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, genetic testing), re-disclosure risk, electronic format risk, marketing disclosure, and non-conditioning of treatment. These are rendered in moderately complex legal language even in translation — e.g., "Entiendo que la información que se divulgue de conformidad con esta Autorización podría estar sujeta a una nueva divulgación por parte de quien la recibe, debido a que es probable que ya no esté protegida por las leyes federales de privacidad."

**Delivery method options:** The form header area lists five delivery methods: "Retiro" (Pick-up), "Correo" (Mail), "Entrega electrónica" (e-Delivery), "CD", and "MyChart". This is notable — electronic delivery is presented as a first-class option.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a general authorization form — section 4 ("Esta información se divulgará a:") asks for a recipient name and address, framing it as release to a third party. However, the email field ("Solicito que me envíen mis registros a esta dirección de correo electrónico:") and the "Retiro" (Pick-up) option suggest it can also serve patient self-access. There is no separate patient-specific access form.

**Scope options:** Strong. Patients can select from ~15 specific record categories, request an "Abstrak" (Abstract) limited to starred reports, specify dates of service, or request "Todos los registros médicos" (All Medical Records). This gives patients meaningful control over what they receive.

**Format/delivery options:** Five options are listed (Pick-up, Mail, e-Delivery, CD, MyChart). The inclusion of MyChart and e-Delivery alongside traditional methods is patient-friendly. The email address field in section 4 further supports electronic delivery.

**HIPAA Right of Access language:** The form does not explicitly cite 45 CFR § 164.524 or use the phrase "right of access." Statement 5g — "Entiendo que Memorial Healthcare System no afectará el tratamiento, el pago, la inscripción ni la elegibilidad para beneficios con base en la completación de esta Autorización" — references the HIPAA non-conditioning requirement but frames it as an authorization-related disclosure rather than a patient right.

**EHI Export awareness:** No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or TEFCA.

**Language accessibility:** The very existence of this Spanish-language form is a significant positive. South Florida's patient population is heavily Spanish-speaking, and providing a fully translated ROI form (not just a cover sheet) removes a meaningful barrier.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** Statement 5b states the authorization expires "seis (6) meses después de la fecha de firma" (six months from date of signature). This is a relatively short window. While not unreasonable per se, it could force patients to re-authorize if processing is delayed. The form does allow patients to specify an alternative date.

**Sensitive information disclosure:** Statement 5c explicitly calls out HIV/AIDS, mental health/behavioral health, substance abuse, and genetic testing information as potentially included. This transparency meets state and federal requirements for special authorization of sensitive records.

**Marketing disclosure:** The form includes a section about whether MHS will receive compensation for the disclosure, with Yes/No checkboxes. This is a HIPAA-required disclosure for marketing-related authorizations (45 CFR § 164.508(a)(3)).

**Revocation:** Statement 5a explains the right to revoke by sending a written request to the privacy officers "que se indican al dorso de este formulario" (listed on the back of this form). However, the extracted text for page 2 is nearly empty — just the patient/identification label and form number. It's unclear whether the back of the physical form contains the privacy officer contact information mentioned.

**No notarization requirement.** No witness requirement. No in-person-only submission restriction.

**Fees:** The form itself does not mention fees. The retrieval notes indicate the medical records webpage mentions "copy charges as authorized by Florida law" with an exception for records sent to treating physicians for continuation of care.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Trilingual availability:** Providing the ROI form in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole reflects genuine attention to the South Florida patient population. Many healthcare systems offer forms only in English, creating barriers for LEP (Limited English Proficiency) patients.
- **Electronic delivery as first-class option:** The form lists "Entrega electrónica," "CD," and "MyChart" alongside traditional methods. The inclusion of a dedicated email address field in section 4 makes electronic delivery actionable, not just theoretical.
- **Granular record selection:** The ~15 record type checkboxes with the "Abstract" shortcut (starred items) give patients meaningful control. The "Todos los registros médicos" option is also available for comprehensive requests.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Page 2 content unclear:** Statement 5a references privacy officer contact information "al dorso de este formulario" (on the back of this form), but the extracted text for page 2 contains only the form header/footer identifiers. Either the back page content was not extracted, or it may be missing from this version. A patient relying on the Spanish form might not find the contacts needed to revoke authorization.
- **Patient access vs. third-party framing:** The form's title ("Autorización para la divulgación") and section 4 framing (release "to" a named recipient) create ambiguity about whether this is the correct form for a patient requesting their own records, versus authorizing release to a third party. The delivery options (Pick-up, MyChart) imply self-access, but the form language does not clearly distinguish the two use cases.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Zero fillable fields:** All four downloaded PDFs (English, Spanish, Creole, Amendment) have zero interactive form fields. For a digitally composed PDF with clear checkbox and text-entry areas, this is a significant missed opportunity — and means the "e-Delivery" and "MyChart" options on the form ironically cannot be selected electronically on the form itself.
