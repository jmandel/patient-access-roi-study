## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **bilingual Spanish/English version of the Authorization for Release of Health Information** form used across the Northwell Health system. Pages 1–3 contain the Spanish-language version; pages 4–6 contain the English-language version, making it a single 6-page combined document. The form ID is VD001SPANISH (9/28/21), matching the VD001 form code of the English-only authorization forms (form-1.pdf and form-3.pdf).

This is a **third-party release authorization** form — it governs release of health information from one entity to another, not patient self-access. Northwell Health separately provides a "Request for Access to Health Information" form (form-2.pdf, form ID VD087) specifically for patients requesting their own records under HIPAA § 164.524. No Spanish version of that patient-access form was found.

In the broader set of six downloaded forms, this document is the only Spanish-language offering. It sits alongside: the English authorization form (form-1.pdf/form-3.pdf), the English patient access form (form-2.pdf), and instructions documents for both English forms (form-4.pdf, form-6.pdf).

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, the Northwell Health medical records page (https://www.northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records) is well-organized and links to this form directly. However, there is a significant **website bug**: the notes document that both the "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)" links on the website point to this same URL (`request-for-access-to-health-info-form-spanish.pdf`). This means a Spanish-speaking patient looking for the patient self-access form would download this third-party authorization form instead — and the filename itself (`request-for-access-to-health-info-form-spanish.pdf`) is misleading, as the document's actual content is the "Authorization for Release" form, not the "Request for Access" form.

The form was findable with standard web searches and is directly linked from the parent system's medical records page. Phelps Hospital does not have its own forms page — all forms are system-wide Northwell Health documents.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable across all 6 pages (13,998 characters). Both the Spanish and English sections have clean, machine-readable text.

**Fillable fields:** The form has 40 interactive fillable fields, which is notably more than the English-only version (form-1.pdf has 38 fields). This is a digital-first fillable PDF, not a scan.

**File format:** 199 KB for 6 pages is reasonable. No embedded images. 13 fonts are used (more than the 3 fonts in the English-only form, reflecting the bilingual content and likely the dual-language layout needing additional font variants).

**OCR/scan artifacts:** The English-language pages (4–6) show visible watermark-like text artifacts from the extracted text — strings like "RM", "FO", "AT\nE", "D", "RA\nN", "SL", "W\n/T", "FI\nLE" appear scattered through the text extraction. These suggest decorative or watermark elements (possibly spelling out "FORM" or "TRANSLATED/FILE") rendered as overlapping rotated text in the PDF. The Spanish pages do not exhibit this issue. While these artifacts don't affect a user filling out the PDF visually, they degrade the text extraction and accessibility for screen readers or programmatic processing.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 6 pages — 3 in Spanish, 3 in English. This is proportionate given the bilingual nature; each language version is 3 pages, matching the English-only form.

**Structure:** The form is organized into 9 numbered sections, identical in both languages:
1. Provider/entity releasing information (from whom)
2. Recipient of information (to whom)
3. Delivery manner and format
4. Verbal discussion authorization
5. Requested health information types
6. Reason for release
7. Legal understanding (HIPAA, NY State Law, 42 CFR Part 2)
8. Sensitive information opt-out (OASAS, OMH, HIV)
9. Expiration date/event

**Clarity:** The Spanish translation reads naturally and uses appropriate medical/legal terminology. Field labels are consistently presented in Spanish with English in parentheses for key terms (e.g., "Paciente/agente/familiar/tutor* (firma)" / "Patient/Agent/Relative/Guardian* (Signature)"). The legal language in Section 7 is dense but matches the complexity of the English original — it covers revocation rights, voluntariness, and redisclosure limitations.

**Layout:** The form includes a structured delivery options table (Section 3) with checkboxes for manner (mail, pickup, email, fax), format (paper, USB, CD), and delivery details. Footer text on each page reads "Copy 1 – Patient Medical Record / Copy 2 – Patient or Patient's Personal Representative," indicating it's designed as a two-copy carbon-style form.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a third-party release form, not a patient self-access form. It does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access). The opening section asks for "Información de contacto del proveedor de atención médica o de la entidad a la que se divulgará esta información (de quién)" — framing the transaction as entity-to-entity release. There is no "To me" checkbox option as found on the patient access form (form-2.pdf).

**Scope options:** Section 5 provides granular choices: medical record abstract, records by date range, entire medical record, lab results, radiology images, itemized bill, and an "other" field. This is a good level of specificity.

**Format options:** Section 3 offers multiple delivery methods (regular mail, facility pickup, electronic mail, fax) and formats (paper copy, secure USB flash drive, CD). Electronic delivery distinguishes between "Correo electrónico seguro" (secure email) and "Correo electrónico no seguro" (unsecure email) with an acknowledgment checkbox about encryption risks.

**Language accessibility:** The existence of a Spanish-language form is a positive for patient access. However, the critical gap is that this is the authorization (third-party release) form, not the patient access form. Spanish-speaking patients who want to request their own records have no Spanish-language version of form-2 (Request for Access) available — the website links for the Spanish patient access form erroneously point to this authorization form.

**Expiration:** Section 9 offers "One (1) year" or a custom expiration date, with the note "*This field must be completed with date or event." This is reasonable and compliant.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Voluntariness statement:** Section 7b explicitly states: "Entiendo que firmo esta autorización voluntariamente. Mi autorización para esta divulgación de información no condicionará mi tratamiento, mi pago, mi inscripción en un plan de salud ni mi elegibilidad para obtener beneficios." This is a proper HIPAA-compliant non-conditioning statement.

**Revocation rights:** Section 7a clearly states the right to revoke authorization in writing at any time, with the standard exception for actions already taken.

**Redisclosure warning:** Section 7c appropriately warns about potential redisclosure and correctly notes the additional protections for substance abuse, mental health, and HIV-related information under federal and state law.

**Sensitive information protections:** Section 8 uses an opt-out model for substance abuse treatment (OASAS), mental health treatment (OMH), and HIV-related information — patients must initial to *exclude* these categories. This is consistent with the English version and complies with NY state requirements.

**Witness requirement:** The signature section includes lines for a witness signature, telephonic interpreter ID, and interpreter signature. The witness line is present but not explicitly marked as mandatory. The form states the patient must sign "a menos que el paciente es un menor de edad de 18 años no emancipado o que de otra manera no está capacitado para firmar" (unless the patient is an unemancipated minor under 18 or otherwise incapable of signing).

**No fees disclosed:** The form does not mention any fees or costs associated with the release of information.

**No notarization required:** The form does not require notarization.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Website mislabeling directs Spanish-speaking patients to the wrong form.** The Northwell website links both "Request for Access Form (Spanish)" and "Authorization Form (Spanish)" to this same file (`request-for-access-to-health-info-form-spanish.pdf`). A Spanish-speaking patient seeking to exercise their HIPAA Right of Access would download this third-party authorization form, which lacks the § 164.524 framing and the "To me" option. This effectively denies Spanish-speaking patients access to the correct patient self-access form — a significant equity and compliance gap.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Filename contradicts content.** The PDF's URL and filename say "request-for-access-to-health-info-form-spanish.pdf" but the document title is "Autorización para divulgar información médica (Authorization for Release of Health Information)." A patient or staff member relying on the filename to identify the document would be misled.
- **Opt-out model for sensitive information may confuse patients.** Section 8 states information "may be released unless you... initial... to opt out." This negative-consent framing means patients who don't understand the section will have sensitive substance abuse, mental health, and HIV information released by default.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Text extraction artifacts on English pages.** Pages 4–6 show scattered text fragments ("RM", "FO", "AT\nE", "D", "RA\nN", "SL", "W\n/T", "FI\nLE") in the extracted text that appear to be watermark or decorative elements. These would interfere with screen reader accessibility and text-based processing.
- **Minor grammar error in Spanish footnote.** The form states "a menos que el paciente es un menor de edad" — this should use the subjunctive: "a menos que el paciente **sea** un menor de edad."

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Bilingual format with parallel structure.** Providing the complete form in both Spanish and English within a single document, with identical section numbering and field structure, is a thoughtful approach that allows Spanish-speaking patients to cross-reference if needed.
- **40 fillable interactive fields** make this a genuinely usable digital form — substantially better than a flat PDF or image scan.
- **Granular delivery options.** The Section 3 delivery matrix offering secure email, unsecure email (with explicit acknowledgment), USB flash drive, CD, fax, mail, and facility pickup is unusually comprehensive and gives patients meaningful choice over how they receive their information.
