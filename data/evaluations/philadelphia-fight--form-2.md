# Evaluation: Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an **"Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Information"** — a general HIPAA authorization form for releasing or receiving protected health information to/from third parties. It is **not** a patient access request form. The document is titled "AUTHORIZATION FOR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION" and opens with: "I am a patient, or a patient's legally authorized representative, of Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers. By signing below, I authorize Philadelphia FIGHT to Disclose my protected health information ('Information') as described below."

Philadelphia FIGHT maintains two distinct ROI-related forms: form-1.pdf is the **patient access** form ("Patient Request for Access to Information," citing the right to inspect or copy one's own PHI), while this form-2.pdf is the **third-party authorization** form. This separation is a meaningful distinction — form-1 is governed by HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access), while form-2 is governed by § 164.508 (Authorizations for Uses and Disclosures). Having both is a best practice that avoids forcing patients seeking their own records into a workflow designed for third-party disclosures.

The form is dated "8.2024" and was downloaded from `https://fight.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Authorization-for-Release-of-Information-8.2024.pdf-CORRECT.pdf`.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was easy to find. Per the retrieval notes, it was located on the organization's **Forms and Consents** page (`https://fight.org/about/forms-and-consents/`), accessible via the main navigation (About → Forms and Consents). The page lists forms with direct PDF download links and offers both English and Spanish versions.

The link text on the page was "Authorization for Release of Information," which is a clear and standard label. The URL filename (`Authorization-for-Release-of-Information-8.2024.pdf-CORRECT.pdf`) is descriptive but slightly awkward — the `-CORRECT` suffix suggests a revision was uploaded to replace an earlier version, and the `.pdf-CORRECT.pdf` double extension is atypical. This is a minor cosmetic issue that doesn't affect function.

Retrieval difficulty was rated **easy** in the notes, with no difficulties reported.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Pages**: 1 page — compact and appropriately sized for a third-party authorization.
- **File size**: 215,245 bytes (~210 KB) for a single-page form with one embedded image. This is reasonable.
- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (3,044 characters), confirming this is a digitally-created document, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **0 fillable fields.** Despite being a digitally-created PDF with a text layer, the form has no interactive form fields. All blanks are represented as underscores (e.g., `Patient First and Last Name:_________________________________________`). Patients must print and hand-fill, or use PDF annotation tools.
- **Fonts**: 6 fonts used.
- **Images**: 1 embedded image (likely the organization logo).
- **Digital-first design**: Partially. The document was created digitally (not scanned), but the lack of fillable fields means it functions as a print-and-fill form. This is a missed opportunity given the otherwise modern design.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportion**: At 1 page and ~3,000 characters, the form is concise and appropriately sized for its purpose. It covers all necessary authorization elements without excessive bulk.

**Organization and structure**: The form follows a logical flow:
1. Header and introductory statement
2. Patient identification (name, DOB)
3. Direction of information flow (checkboxes for "Release Information to" / "Receive Information from")
4. Recipient/sender details (name, address, phone, fax)
5. Information types to disclose (checkboxes)
6. Date restrictions
7. Purpose of disclosure
8. Sensitive information exclusion section
9. Authorization terms (conditional treatment, expiration, revocation, redisclosure)
10. Signature block

**Clarity**: The language balances legal precision with readability. The authorization terms use "I understand that..." framing for each key concept, which is patient-friendly. The introductory statement clearly establishes voluntariness: "I understand that signing this Authorization is voluntary."

**Information type options**: The form provides checkboxes for "Entire Medical Record," "Labs," "Medication List," "Diagnostic Report," and "Other (specify)." This gives reasonable granularity.

**Sensitive information handling**: The form includes a notable section addressing sensitive categories: "the Information Disclosed may include information pertaining to the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, hepatitis C or genetics." It then provides numbered lines (1-6) where patients can exclude specific categories. This proactively addresses Pennsylvania's Act 148 and other state-specific protections. Given that Philadelphia FIGHT is an organization historically focused on HIV/AIDS care, this section is especially relevant and thoughtfully included.

**Layout**: Clean and organized. Checkbox-based selections are clearly delineated. The form uses visual separation between sections, though without heavy rules or boxes.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Scope**: This form is designed for **third-party release**, not patient access. It supports both directions ("Release Information to" and "Receive Information from"), which is appropriate for its purpose. Patients seeking their own records should use form-1.pdf instead.

**Format/delivery options**: The form does not specify delivery methods (mail, fax, electronic, pick-up) for the disclosed information. It captures the recipient's address, phone, and fax number but doesn't explicitly ask the patient how the information should be transmitted.

**Expiration**: The form states it expires on a patient-specified date/event, or "in 5 years after the date of my signature if no other date or event is listed." This is a reasonable default — long enough to be practical, with clear patient control over a shorter window.

**Revocation rights**: Clearly explained — "I have the right to revoke this authorization, at any time, by sending written notification to Philadelphia FIGHT Privacy Officer, 1233 Locust St. 5th Floor, Philadelphia PA 19107." The mailing address is specific and actionable.

**Conditional treatment**: The form explicitly states: "my treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility for benefits will not be affected if this Authorization is not signed." This is a required HIPAA element and is clearly presented.

**Right to a copy**: "I understand that I have the right to receive a signed copy of this authorization." This is stated clearly.

**Submission instructions**: Unlike form-1, this form does **not** include instructions for how to submit the completed authorization (no mention of email, fax, mail, or in-person submission options). This is a gap — a patient completing the form has no guidance on where to send it.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**HIPAA authorization elements (§ 164.508)**: The form includes the core required elements:
- Description of information to be disclosed ✓
- Person/entity authorized to make disclosure ✓
- Person/entity to whom disclosure is made ✓
- Purpose of disclosure ✓ (open-ended field)
- Expiration date/event ✓
- Right to revoke ✓
- Conditioning statement ✓
- Redisclosure warning ✓
- Signature and date ✓

**No unreasonable barriers observed**: The form does not require notarization, witness signatures, or in-person submission. It does not mention fees.

**State-specific compliance**: The reference to "Act 148" (Pennsylvania's mental health confidentiality law) and the sensitive information exclusion section demonstrate awareness of state-specific requirements beyond baseline HIPAA.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Separate forms for patient access vs. third-party release**: Philadelphia FIGHT correctly distinguishes between patient access (form-1) and third-party authorization (form-2). Many organizations use a single form that conflates these distinct HIPAA rights, creating confusion and potential over-authorization.
- **Sensitive information opt-out with specificity**: The proactive listing of sensitive categories (HIV, AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, STDs, hepatitis C, genetics, tuberculosis) with numbered exclusion lines gives patients granular control over what is shared. This is especially meaningful for an organization serving populations where HIV/AIDS stigma is a real concern.
- **Bilateral direction support**: The "Release Information to" / "Receive Information from" toggle is a clean design that allows the same form to serve both outbound disclosures and requests for information from external providers.
- **5-year default expiration**: A generous but bounded default that balances convenience with patient protection.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **No submission instructions**: The form lacks any guidance on how or where to submit the completed authorization. Form-1 includes clear multi-channel submission options (in person, email, fax, mail), but form-2 does not. A patient completing this form would have to guess where to send it or call the office.
- **Purpose of disclosure left open-ended**: The "Purpose(s) of Disclosure" field is a blank line with no checkboxes or examples. While this preserves flexibility, patients may struggle to know what to write or may leave it blank, which could render the authorization insufficient.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Awkward URL filename**: The download URL ends with `...8.2024.pdf-CORRECT.pdf`, suggesting the file was uploaded as a correction but with an artifact in the filename. The `.pdf-CORRECT.pdf` double extension is a minor hygiene issue.
