# Ben Taub Hospital — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**Document title:** "Authorization for Release of Information — Media, Marketing and Educational Use"

This is **not** a patient records access form. It is a marketing/media authorization that permits Harris Health System to use or disclose patient information for media, marketing, or educational purposes (e.g., photographs, videos, audio recordings). The form document number is 282758(8.19), indicating it was last revised in August 2019.

**Relationship to other documents found:** Ben Taub Hospital is part of Harris Health System, and both forms found are system-level Harris Health documents. Form-1.pdf is the actual ROI form ("Authorization for Use, Request and Disclosure of Protected Health Information"), which is the primary patient access authorization. Form-2.pdf serves a completely different purpose — it governs patient consent for the *organization's* use of patient information in marketing and media, not the *patient's* right to obtain their own records. These two forms are complementary but serve opposite information flows: form-1 is patient-initiated (information flowing *to* the patient or their designee), while form-2 is organization-initiated (information flowing *from* the patient for the organization's benefit).

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was surfaced during a `site:harrishealth.org` web search alongside the primary ROI form. Its source URL (`https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/282758-authorization-for-marketing-and-educational-use-english.pdf`) is descriptive and clearly identifies the document's purpose. However, it was not linked from the medical records page — it appeared as a separate search result. A patient looking for their records release form might encounter this document and be confused about whether it applies to them. The filename includes "english," which suggests a Spanish-language version may exist, though none was found during retrieval.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present — full text is extractable (3,637 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite being a digital PDF (not a scanned paper form), it has no interactive form fields. All blanks are represented as underscores (`____`), requiring the patient to print and handwrite. This is a significant step down from form-1, which has 65 fillable fields.
- **File size:** 594,254 bytes (594 KB) for a single-page document — notably large, likely due to the embedded image (probably the Harris Health logo). Form-1 is smaller (430 KB) despite having more content and 65 fillable fields.
- **Page count:** 1 page.
- **Font count:** 10 fonts — high for a one-page document, suggesting somewhat complex formatting.
- **Digital-first design:** Partial. It has a proper text layer and was clearly authored digitally (not scanned), but the lack of fillable fields means it functions as a print-and-fill document. The shaded area instruction ("A Harris Health System representative or designee fills out the shaded area as directed by the patient or patient's representative") suggests a workflow where staff complete part of the form, which may explain the absence of fillable fields — it appears designed for in-person staff-assisted completion.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportion:** A single page covering all necessary elements (patient identification, information scope, reason for disclosure, sensitive information consent, expiration/withdrawal provisions, and signatures). The length is appropriate for its purpose.

**Clarity:** The opening paragraph is relatively readable: "I hereby authorize the Harris Health System to use or disclose the following information. This authorization is voluntary and Harris Health System will not be making payments of any kind." It clearly states voluntariness and non-payment. However, it also includes a dense liability release clause: "I hereby release Harris Health System, its governing board, administrators, employees and affiliating physicians from any legal liability for disclosure of my health information or that of my dependent(s) as permitted by this authorization." This is more typical of legal boilerplate than plain-language communication.

**Organization:** The form flows logically: identification → scope → reason → sensitive information → expiration → signatures. Sections are distinguishable but lack strong visual headers or separation lines. The form uses bold text for some section titles ("Drug and Alcohol Use, Psychiatric, and/or HIV/AIDS Information Release" and "Expiration/Withdrawal of Authorization") which helps navigation.

**Layout:** Moderately clean for a one-page form. The use of underscores for blank fields creates a somewhat cluttered visual, especially in the patient information section where multiple fields are packed together. The "Type of patient information" section uses a Check-where-appropriate format with colons and underscores that is compact but less visually clear than checkboxes.

**Footer:** Contains document control language: "Printed versions of this document are uncontrolled. Please go to the Harris Health Document Control Center to retrieve an official controlled version of the document. https://apps.hchd.local/sites/dcc" — notably, this URL points to an internal intranet address (`apps.hchd.local`), which is inaccessible to patients.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Not a patient access form.** This form does not serve a patient trying to access their own health records. It serves the opposite purpose — authorizing the organization to use the patient's information for media, marketing, and educational purposes. A patient should never need to fill out this form to obtain their records.

**Scope options:** Limited to three categories (media, marketing, educational) plus an "other" option. For information type, the options are "Nature of injury or illness," "Nature of treatment," and "Recordings" (defined as "Any and all recordings, including, but not limited to videotapes, photographs, or electronic, digital or audio recordings"). This is appropriately narrow for a marketing release.

**Sensitive information consent:** The form separately addresses drug/alcohol use, psychiatric, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, and STD information with a Yes/No checkbox, which is appropriate — patients should have explicit control over whether sensitive categories are included in marketing materials.

**Format/delivery options:** None mentioned. The form does not address how the authorized disclosure will occur, which is reasonable since the organization (not the patient) would be initiating the use.

**Voluntariness statement:** Clearly stated upfront: "If I refuse to participate, my refusal will not affect my ability or that of my dependent(s) to receive health care from Harris Health System." This is a good practice.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** The form states it "will expire on December 31, ______ (20 years from the year this document was signed), unless the patient is a minor, in which case this authorization will expire when the patient turns 18 years of age." A 20-year default expiration for marketing use is extremely long and may be concerning — a patient authorizing the use of their photo in a brochure today could have that authorization remain active until 2046.

**Withdrawal mechanism:** The form provides a postal address for withdrawing authorization: "Harris Health System HIM/Medical Records, Authorization Withdrawal P.O. Box 66769, Houston, TX 77266-6769." Notably, this is a different address from form-1's withdrawal contact (4800 Fournace Place, Bellaire, TX 77401 or email at AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org). Form-2 provides only a mailing address — no email option for withdrawal, unlike form-1.

**Liability release:** The form includes a blanket legal liability release ("I hereby release Harris Health System, its governing board, administrators, employees and affiliating physicians from any legal liability"), which is a standard but notable provision. Patients waive the right to sue over disclosures made under this authorization.

**No payment disclosure:** The form states "Harris Health System IS NOT receiving payment of any kind from any source for the use of my information" (emphasis in original). This is a HIPAA requirement for marketing authorizations — if the organization were receiving payment, additional disclosure would be required.

**Re-disclosure warning:** Present but minimal: "I understand that once my information is disclosed, it may be re-disclosed by the recipient and no longer protected by federal or state privacy laws." This is a standard HIPAA notice.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **20-year default expiration for marketing authorization.** The form defaults to a 20-year expiration, which is extraordinarily long for a marketing consent. A patient who signs this form in 2026 would have their marketing authorization active until 2046. While the patient can revoke by written notice, the burden is on the patient to remember and act. Most marketing authorizations default to 1-2 years. The "if desired" phrasing on the expiration date field — "Date of release expiration (if desired)" — makes the shorter expiration feel optional, with the 20-year default serving as the norm.
- **No email or electronic withdrawal option.** Unlike form-1 (which provides both a physical address and email for withdrawal), form-2 only offers a P.O. Box mailing address for withdrawal. This creates an asymmetry: the authorization can presumably be signed in person at any facility, but revoking it requires locating and mailing a letter to a specific P.O. Box.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Recordings (Any and all recordings…)"** checkbox language is extremely broad. It covers "videotapes, photographs, or electronic, digital or audio recordings" without specifying context or limiting to recordings made during the healthcare encounter. A patient checking this box could reasonably be authorizing release of any recording Harris Health possesses.
- **Shaded area instruction may confuse patients.** The form states "A Harris Health System representative or designee fills out the shaded area as directed by the patient or patient's representative" — but in the PDF, the shading distinction may not be visible or clear, particularly if printed in black and white.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Internal intranet URL in footer.** The document control footer references `https://apps.hchd.local/sites/dcc` — an internal network address inaccessible to patients or anyone outside the Harris Health network. This is a minor but sloppy inclusion in a patient-facing document.
- **Inconsistent withdrawal addresses between forms.** Form-1 directs authorization withdrawal to "4800 Fournace Place, Bellaire, Texas 77401, or via email at AuthorizationWithdrawal@harrishealth.org" while form-2 directs to "P.O. Box 66769, Houston, TX 77266-6769" with no email option. While these may legitimately be different processes, the inconsistency could confuse patients who have signed both forms.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Clear voluntariness language.** The form explicitly states that refusing to participate will not affect healthcare access — and this statement appears prominently near the top of the form, not buried in fine print.
- **Explicit no-payment disclosure.** The form uses capitalized emphasis ("IS NOT receiving payment") to highlight that Harris Health is not being paid for the patient's information, which is a HIPAA requirement for marketing authorizations that is often buried or omitted.
