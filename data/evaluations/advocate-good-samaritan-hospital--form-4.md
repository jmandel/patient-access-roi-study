## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-4 is titled **"Patient Request for Health Information"** with the subtitle "(Authorization to Release Protected Health Information)." This is the **primary patient-access form** — designed specifically for patients requesting their own records. It is distinct from the other six forms found for this organization:

- **form-1.pdf** and **form-3.pdf**: Employee Assistance Program (EAP) release forms — not relevant to patient medical records access.
- **form-2.pdf**: An older Advocate Medical Group (AMG) "Authorization for Release of Patient Health Information" — a third-party release form with a different form number (98-5050-EN) and older branding.
- **form-5.pdf**: "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" (S300503, Rev. 11/25) — the current general third-party release/disclosure form. This is the companion form to form-4; form-4 is for patients requesting their own records, form-5 is for authorizing disclosure to third parties.
- **form-6.pdf**: Spanish-language version of an authorization form (S23623-SP, Rev. 06/24).
- **form-7.pdf**: An instructions document explaining how to complete the authorization form.

Form-4 is a system-wide Advocate Health form, not specific to Good Samaritan Hospital. It serves all facilities in the Advocate Health system. The form number S88411-EN and revision date 11/25 indicate it was recently updated (November 2025).

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, navigating directly to the Advocate Health medical records page (https://www.advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records) was "the most productive source." The page "clearly lists two primary forms (Patient Request form and Authorization to Release form) with PDF download links." Web searches also surfaced direct PDF URLs, though some results returned EAP forms rather than hospital patient forms.

The form is centralized at the system level rather than hospital-specific, which is both a strength (consistency) and a potential confusion point (patients searching specifically for "Good Samaritan Hospital medical records form" may not immediately find the system-wide page). The URL path (`/contact-us/medical-records/`) is intuitive. The filename (`patient-request-for-health-information-s88411en.PDF`) is descriptive.

Overall, findability is good — the form is publicly available, linked from a logical location, and reachable via web search.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size**: 164,638 bytes (161 KB) for a single page — reasonable.
- **Page count**: 1 page.
- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (2,438 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **0**. Despite being a digital PDF with 8 embedded fonts and no images, the form has no interactive form fields. All blanks (Patient Name, Date of Birth, Address, etc.) and checkboxes are rendered as static text/graphics. Patients must print and hand-fill, or use a PDF annotation tool.
- **Fonts**: 8 fonts embedded — indicates a digitally composed document, not a scan.
- **Images**: 0 embedded images — the form is entirely text/vector-based.

The form is clearly **digitally designed** (not a scan), which makes the absence of fillable fields a missed opportunity. A form this clean could easily support interactive fields. The document opens the header with a portal reference ("Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org."), which partially mitigates the lack of fillability by pointing patients toward a digital alternative.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 1 page — concise and proportionate. The form fits everything needed onto a single page, which is commendable.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow:
1. Patient portal callout (top)
2. Patient demographics (name, DOB, address, phone, email)
3. Treatment facility/physician and dates
4. Information requested — three clear categories: Medical Records (13 checkbox options), Imaging (5 options), Billing (4 options)
5. Recipient ("Send my requested information to: ☐ Myself ☐ Other")
6. Delivery method (Mail: Paper Copy/CD; Electronically: Encrypted Email/Patient Portal; Other: In Person Pick-up)
7. Sensitive information disclosure statement
8. Signature and date
9. Minor authorization section

**Clarity**: The language is generally plain and accessible. The header "Patient Request for Health Information" is clear. Instructions like "(One Patient Per Form)" and "(select all that apply)" are helpful. The sensitive info statement is more readable than typical legal boilerplate: "I understand the information to be disclosed may include information regarding genetic testing, genetic services and family medical history, mental health/developmental disabilities, Substance Use Disorder, HIV Test results and AIDS/AIDS-related illness."

**Layout**: The form packs a lot into one page. The three-column layout for Medical Records / Imaging / Billing is efficient. The delivery method section uses a clear grid format. However, the density means the font size is likely small, and the extracted text shows some formatting artifacts (e.g., `\u0007` control characters before imaging checkboxes).

**Record type granularity**: The form offers 22+ specific record type checkboxes across three categories, plus "Other" options. This is notably granular, including items like "Sleep Study Reports," "Fetal Ultrasound Images," "UB04 Form," and "CMS 1500 Form" — which serve both clinical and billing purposes.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access focus**: This form is **explicitly designed for patient access**. The title says "Patient Request," and the first recipient checkbox is "☐ Myself." The opening line directs patients to the portal for online access. This is one of the few forms in this study that makes a clear distinction between patient self-request and third-party release (form-5 handles the latter).

**Scope options**: Excellent. Patients can select specific record types across medical records, imaging, and billing categories. They can specify treatment dates and the treating facility/physician. The "Entire Medical Record" option is available for those who want everything.

**Format/delivery options**: The form offers **five delivery methods**:
- Paper Copy (by mail)
- CD (by mail or in-person)
- Encrypted Email
- Patient Portal
- In Person Pick-up

This is notably comprehensive. The inclusion of "Encrypted Email" and "Patient Portal" as electronic options demonstrates awareness of digital delivery needs.

**Portal reference**: The form opens with: "Did you know you can request and access your medical records online through your patient portal? Visit: https://livewell.aah.org." This proactively directs patients to the fastest access path.

**Right of Access language**: The form does **not** explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access. The sensitive information statement and minor authorization language reference applicable law implicitly, but there is no explicit patient rights section explaining the right to receive one's own records. (By contrast, form-5 includes a "Your Rights Regarding This Authorization" section.)

**EHI Export / bulk data**: No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or bulk data options.

**Fees**: The delivery method section notes "(Fees may apply)" but provides no specifics about fee amounts or fee structure. This is vague but not overtly problematic.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Barriers**: No notarization requirement. No in-person-only submission requirement (in-person is offered as one of several options). No witness requirement for the standard signature (unlike the older form-2). The form is relatively barrier-free.

**Expiration**: The form does **not** include an expiration clause or auto-revocation provision. This is notable — form-5 (the third-party release) states "This authorization expires one year from the date of my signature," but form-4 contains no such language. Since this is a patient request rather than an ongoing authorization, the absence of an expiration clause is appropriate.

**Sensitive information**: The form includes a blanket disclosure statement: "I understand the information to be disclosed may include information regarding genetic testing, genetic services and family medical history, mental health/developmental disabilities, Substance Use Disorder, HIV Test results and AIDS/AIDS-related illness." Importantly, unlike form-5 and the older form-2, this form does **not** offer opt-out checkboxes for specific sensitive categories. When a patient requests their own records, this blanket acknowledgment is appropriate — 42 CFR Part 2 restrictions on substance use disorder records apply to third-party disclosures, not necessarily to patient self-access.

**Typed signatures**: The form does not explicitly state whether typed/electronic signatures are accepted. The instructions document (form-7) states "Typed signatures are not accepted," though form-7 is written for form-5, not form-4. It is unclear whether this restriction applies to form-4 as well.

**Submission method**: The form does not specify how to submit the completed form (mail, fax, in-person, email). This is an omission — patients have no clear instruction on where to send the completed form. There is no mailing address, fax number, or email address for submission.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated patient access form**: Advocate Health maintains a separate form specifically for patients requesting their own records, distinct from the third-party release authorization. This is a best practice that most organizations do not follow.
- **Portal callout at the top**: The opening line proactively directs patients to the LiveWell patient portal for online access — positioned prominently before any form fields. This is excellent patient-first design.
- **Five delivery methods**: Offering Paper, CD, Encrypted Email, Patient Portal, and In-Person Pick-up gives patients genuine choice. The inclusion of Encrypted Email is uncommon and welcome.
- **Single-page design**: Fitting a comprehensive records request with 22+ record-type checkboxes, delivery options, and signature blocks onto one page is an achievement in concise form design.
- **Companion materials ecosystem**: The form exists within a suite including a third-party release form (form-5), Spanish-language version (form-6), and step-by-step instructions (form-7). This is a thoughtful, patient-supportive approach.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions**: The form does not tell patients where to send or deliver the completed form — no mailing address, fax number, email address, or department contact is provided. Patients must presumably return to the medical records webpage or call the hospital to figure out how to submit.
- **"Fees may apply"**: The parenthetical "(Fees may apply)" next to delivery method is vague. It doesn't specify fee amounts, when fees do vs. don't apply, or whether fees differ by format. HIPAA limits fees for patient access to a reasonable, cost-based fee, but this form provides no guidance.
- **Typed signature policy unclear**: Form-7's instructions (written for form-5) state "Typed signatures are not accepted." Whether this applies to form-4 is not stated, creating ambiguity for patients attempting to complete the form digitally.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Control character artifacts**: The extracted text contains `\u0007` (BEL) control characters before several checkbox items in the Imaging and Billing sections (e.g., `¨ \u0007Radiology Images`). This suggests minor PDF encoding issues that could affect screen readers or text extraction tools.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No fillable fields on a digitally-designed form**: Despite being a born-digital PDF with 8 fonts and clean vector graphics, the form has zero interactive fields. This forces patients to print, hand-fill, scan, and submit — an unnecessary barrier when the digital infrastructure clearly exists to support fillable fields.
