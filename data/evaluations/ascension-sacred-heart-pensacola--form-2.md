# Evaluation: Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **department-specific inbound records release form** titled "MEDICAL RECORDS RELEASE FORM OF MEDICAL INFORMATION." It is designed for patients to authorize the transfer of their records **from another provider to** Sacred Heart's Department of Radiation Oncology at 1545 Airport Blvd, Suite 1000, Pensacola, FL 32504. The destination is pre-printed on the form: "To release to Sacred Heart Health System."

This is the second of two forms found for this organization. Form-1 is the primary general-purpose "Authorization for Release of Medical Information **From** Ascension Sacred Heart" — the standard outbound ROI form. Form-2 serves a fundamentally different purpose: it facilitates the *inbound* flow of records to a specific cancer treatment department, not patient self-access to records. The form uses the legacy "Sacred Heart Health System" branding rather than the current "Ascension Sacred Heart" name, and the filename (`031616-records-release-shcc.pdf`) suggests it dates from March 2016.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was found through a web search for Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola ROI-related PDFs. According to the retrieval notes, the search process was rated "Easy" overall, though this form was discovered as a secondary find alongside the primary ROI form. The source URL (`https://healthcare.ascension.org/-/media/project/ascension/healthcare/legacy/markets/florida/flpen_cancer_pdfs/patient-forms/031616-records-release-shcc.pdf`) places it in a legacy cancer center patient forms directory, not on a prominently linked medical records page. The URL path includes "legacy," suggesting this form has been migrated from an older content system. The filename "031616-records-release-shcc" is somewhat descriptive ("shcc" = Sacred Heart Cancer Center) but not particularly patient-friendly. A patient looking for a way to request their own records would not naturally find or need this form — it would only be relevant to cancer patients coordinating care with Radiation Oncology.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable (3,626 characters), confirming this is not a scanned image.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. The form has no interactive form fields despite having 8 fonts and a structured layout. All blanks are represented as underline characters (`______`), designed for handwritten completion.
- **File size**: 199,659 bytes (200 KB) for a single page, which is slightly large but not unreasonable given the 1 embedded image (likely a logo or header graphic).
- **Digital design**: This is a print-first document. The underline-based fields, checkbox squares, and overall layout all assume the form will be printed and filled out by hand. There is no accommodation for digital completion.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page (appropriate for the content).

**Clarity and language**: The form mixes plain-language instructions with dense legal boilerplate. The top section (patient information, record type selection) is reasonably clear, but the bottom half packs heavy legal text into a small space. The sensitive-information authorization paragraph is a single dense block beginning with "I DO / I DO NOT authorization the release of information, including, if applicable, specific laboratory tests of HIV Infection..." — this is difficult to parse.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → source/destination providers → record type selection → purpose → sensitive information authorization → legal disclosures → signatures. However, the legal disclosures section uses bullet points (represented as checkbox-style squares) for unrelated statements (expiration, revocation, redisclosure), which could confuse patients into thinking these are optional selections rather than mandatory notices.

**Record type options**: The form offers checkboxes for Emergency Care, Hospitalization, and Outpatient Care (with date fields), plus specific report types: History & Physical, Discharge Summary, Immunization Records, Physical Therapy Notes, Lab, Pathology (listed **twice**), X-Ray, Occupational Therapy, and Abstract. The "Other" option provides limited write-in space.

**Purpose options**: Three choices: "at the request of the patient," "for diagnosis/treatment purposes," and "other."

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This form is **not a patient access form**. It is designed for a narrow clinical workflow: authorizing the transfer of records from an outside provider into Sacred Heart's Radiation Oncology department. The pre-printed destination address and department name make this clear. A patient trying to obtain their own records should use form-1 instead; this form would not serve that purpose.

- **No electronic delivery option**: The form does not mention electronic vs. paper format (unlike form-1, which explicitly offers this choice).
- **No HIPAA Right of Access language**: There is no reference to 45 CFR § 164.524 or patient access rights. This is somewhat expected given that the form is designed for provider-to-provider transfer, not patient self-access.
- **No EHI export mention**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data.
- **Social Security Number requested**: The form asks for the patient's "SOCIAL SECURITY NO," which is a privacy concern. SSN is not necessary for medical records transfer and creates an unnecessary data exposure risk for patients.
- **Scope options**: Patients can specify date ranges and record types, which is appropriate for a records transfer form.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Authorization expiration**: "This authorization will expire one (1) year from the date of my signature." This is standard.
- **Revocation rights**: The form states patients can revoke in writing, with standard exceptions for reliance and insurance conditions. However, the revocation instructions say to provide "a written revocation to the provider from which records are requested in the box above" — meaning the revocation goes to the *source* provider, not to Sacred Heart. This is technically correct for an inbound transfer authorization.
- **Redisclosure warning**: Present: "I understand that my Protected Health Information (PHI) that is used or disclosed under this Authorization may be subject to redisclosure by the recipient."
- **Liability release**: The form includes language relieving the releasor of "any responsibility or liability that may arise from the release or reproduction of such records." While common, this language is one-sided and may discourage patients from asserting their rights.
- **Witness requirement**: The form has a "Witness" signature line with a corresponding "Date" field. This adds a barrier for patients completing the form independently, as it implies a witness is required for the authorization to be valid.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Social Security Number collection**: The form requests "SOCIAL SECURITY NO" as a standard identification field. SSN is not required for medical records transfer and creates unnecessary privacy risk. This is particularly concerning on a non-fillable PDF that patients would need to print, handwrite their SSN on, and then fax or mail — creating multiple opportunities for SSN exposure.
- **Witness requirement**: The presence of a "Witness" signature line implies a witness is needed. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient authorizations, and this creates a logistical barrier for patients completing the form at home.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Form purpose confusion**: The title "MEDICAL RECORDS RELEASE FORM OF MEDICAL INFORMATION" is awkward and does not clearly convey that this is an *inbound* records request to Radiation Oncology. A patient could easily mistake this for a general records release form. The distinction between this form and form-1 is not explained anywhere on the form itself.
- **"I DO / I DO NOT authorization"**: The sensitive-information consent uses a fill-in-the-blank format ("_____ I DO _____ I DO NOT") but does not explain what happens if the patient leaves this blank or checks both. The word "authorization" appears to be a grammatical error (should be "authorize").

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo: "immunodeficient"**: The form reads "Human immunodeficient Virus" — should be "Human Immunodeficiency Virus."
- **Typo: "relieve" → "relieved"**: The liability clause reads "are hereby relieve of any responsibility" — should be "relieved."
- **Typo: "authorization" → "authorize"**: "I DO NOT authorization the release of information" — should be "authorize."
- **Duplicate entry**: "Pathology" appears **twice** in the record type checkboxes, occupying two separate lines.
- **Outdated branding**: The form uses "Sacred Heart Health System" rather than the current "Ascension Sacred Heart" branding, and the filename date stamp (031616) suggests it has not been updated since March 2016 — nearly 10 years old at the time of this evaluation.
- **Inconsistent capitalization**: "immunodeficient Virus" mixes lowercase and capitalized words incorrectly.
