# Evaluation: NorthLakes Community Clinic — form-2.pdf

**Organization:** NorthLakes Community Clinic (Ashland, WI)  
**Document:** form-2.pdf ("Health Information Release")  
**Source URL:** https://nlccwi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Health-Information-Release-Form-Fillable-422.pdf  
**Form ID:** NLCC-ExtROI0-422 / REG-002  
**Dated:** April 2022  

---

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "HEALTH INFORMATION RELEASE" form — a general-purpose authorization for releasing or receiving health records. It is the **older of two ROI forms** published by NorthLakes Community Clinic. The newer form-1.pdf ("Release of Information," dated 12/2023) appears to be a redesigned replacement with clearer structure, numbered sections, explicit FROM/TO labeling, and an encrypted email option that this older form lacks.

Both forms share the same internal registration number (REG-002) and similar naming conventions (NLCC-ExtROI0-422 vs. NLCC-ExtROI0-1223), suggesting form-2 is a predecessor version that has not been removed from the website. The filename includes "Fillable" in its name, indicating it was intentionally created as a digital-first fillable PDF.

This form is a **general-purpose HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 authorization**, not a patient-access-specific request form. It covers releases both to and from the organization and includes purposes like "Litigation," "Disability," and "Work Comp" alongside "Self/Personal." There is no language specifically addressing HIPAA's Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, both forms were **easily discoverable** via standard web searches (`NorthLakes Community Clinic "medical records" "release form" filetype:pdf`). The forms are publicly hosted as direct PDF links on the organization's website, accessible from the medical records page at https://nlccwi.org/for-our-patients/medical-records/. No bot blocking, login, or JavaScript rendering was required.

The URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Health-Information-Release-Form-Fillable-422.pdf`) is a standard WordPress media upload path — reasonably descriptive but not a clean, permanent URL. The "422" date suffix and "Fillable" label in the filename provide useful context before downloading.

However, having two ROI forms simultaneously available with no clear guidance on which to use introduces potential confusion. A patient arriving at the medical records page would see both and need to determine which is current.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present. The form has extractable text (4,433 characters) and is not an image-only scan.

**Fillable fields:** The form reports **54 fillable form fields**, which is a strong count for a single-page form. The filename explicitly labels it as "Fillable." This is a genuinely interactive PDF designed for digital completion.

**File size:** 153,560 bytes (150 KB) for a one-page document with 12 embedded images. This is slightly heavy for a single page, likely due to logo graphics or background images, but not unreasonable.

**Page count:** 1 page. Compact for the amount of content it carries, though this contributes to a dense layout.

**Font count:** 5 fonts embedded — reasonable.

**Digital-first design:** Yes — this was designed as a digital document with fillable fields, not a scanned paper form. It represents a meaningful effort to provide a digitally usable artifact.

---

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** At one page, the form is impressively compact but pays a price in density. The authorization/consent paragraph (section spanning the area after the record type checkboxes) is a solid wall of legal text with no paragraph breaks, bullet points, or visual separation.

**Organization:** The form uses numbered sections (1 through 5), providing some logical structure:
1. Patient Personal Information
2. Authorization direction (Release To / Receive From / Verbal Only)
3. Purpose
4. Type of information
5. Signature

This ordering is reasonable, though cramming everything onto one page limits the breathing room between sections.

**Clarity and language:** The consent paragraph is dense legalese. Consider this single unbroken sentence: *"I understand that the information in my medical records may include information relating to sexually transmitted disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), psychiatric management, behavioral and mental health services, and treatment for alcohol and drug use through NorthLakes general provision of health care."* This is followed by additional dense text about 42 CFR Part 2 protections, Wisconsin DHS regulations, and revocation rights — all in a continuous paragraph with no visual breaks.

**Checkbox layout:** The record type selection area (section 4) uses a two-column layout mixing purposes (left) and record types (right) in a way that could be confusing. Purpose checkboxes (Litigation, Disability, School, etc.) appear visually interleaved with the record type checkboxes (History & Physical, Progress Notes, etc.) despite being semantically distinct sections (3 vs. 4).

**Notable field:** "Release paper records now? Yes / No" appears in section 1 (Patient Personal Information), which is an odd placement for a delivery preference.

---

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a **general authorization form**, not a patient-access-specific form. The checkboxes offer "Release To," "Receive From," and "Verbal Only" — the form handles bidirectional information flow. A patient requesting their own records would check "Release To" and fill in their own name/address, but the form doesn't streamline or highlight this use case.

**Purpose options:** "Self/Personal" is available as a purpose checkbox, which is appropriate for patient access requests. However, it is listed alongside "Litigation," "Disability," "Work Comp," and "School" with no indication of which is most common or which pathway may have different rights/timelines.

**Scope options:** The form provides a good range of record type checkboxes: entire medical file, entire dental file, entire mental health file, entire substance use disorder file, entire psych med management file, progress notes, diagnosis test reports, lab reports/pathology, evaluation/assessment, discharge summary, psychological testing, HIV/AIDS, and STD. A date range field is provided. This granularity gives patients meaningful control over what they request.

**Delivery format options:** The form includes fax fields in the "Release To" section. There is a "Release paper records now?" checkbox. However, there is **no option for electronic delivery via email, patient portal, or electronic media** — a notable gap compared to form-1.pdf, which offers encrypted email.

**Right of Access language:** The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 (Right of Access) by name. It references Wisconsin DHS sections "ss. DHS 92.05, 92.06, and 94.05" for the right to receive a copy of disclosed information. It references "42 CFR Part 2 and/or HIPAA 45 CFR" for substance use disorder records protections. There is no mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

**Revocation rights:** The form states: *"I understand that I have a right to revoke this authorization at any time. I understand that if I revoke this authorization, I can do so in writing or verbally. However, it is highly recommended to send a written revocation to the Medical Records Department."* This is patient-friendly — it acknowledges verbal revocation is possible while recommending written.

**Minor consent:** The form includes a second signature line for parent/guardian when "patient is 14+ years of age," indicating awareness of Wisconsin's minor consent provisions for mental health records.

---

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** "This authorization will expire one year from the above date unless I specify an expiration date." A one-year default is standard and reasonable.

**Treatment conditioning:** The consent text states *"I need not sign this form in order to assure treatment"* — this is appropriate and required language.

**Re-disclosure warning:** The form includes appropriate re-disclosure language: *"any disclosure of information carries with it the potential for an unauthorized re-disclosure and the information may not be protected by federal confidentiality rules."*

**42 CFR Part 2 compliance:** The form addresses substance use disorder record protections appropriately, noting that records from the NorthLakes Recovery Program are protected under 42 CFR Part 2 and require written consent for disclosure.

**Fee disclosure:** No fees are mentioned. The form does not disclose whether costs may be involved in fulfilling a records request.

**Submission method:** The form header includes the organization's phone number (888.834.4551) and website (nlccwi.org) but does **not specify how or where to submit the completed form**. There is no fax number for submission (unlike form-1.pdf which prominently displays "Please fax to 715-318-5644"), no mailing address, and no email address for submission. A patient filling out this form has no clear instruction on what to do with it once completed.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No submission instructions.** The form provides no fax number, mailing address, email address, or other instruction for how to submit the completed authorization. The only contact information is the general phone number (888.834.4551) and website (nlccwi.org). This creates a real barrier — a patient could fill out the entire form and have no idea what to do next. Form-1.pdf, by contrast, prominently instructs patients to fax to 715-318-5644.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Two active forms, no versioning guidance.** Both form-1 (12/2023) and form-2 (4/2022) are publicly available on the same website with no indication of which is current, preferred, or intended for different purposes. They share the same REG-002 registration number, suggesting form-2 should have been superseded.
- **"Release paper records now?" is ambiguous.** This field appears in the patient information section without explanation of what "paper records" means in context — does it mean the patient wants to walk out with physical copies immediately? Does it bypass the normal processing timeline? Its placement in Section 1 (Personal Information) rather than near delivery preferences adds to the confusion.
- **Mixed section numbering.** Sections 3 (Purpose) and 4 (Record type) appear visually interleaved in a two-column layout, making it unclear which checkboxes belong to which section.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Inconsistent minor age thresholds between forms.** Form-2 states parent/guardian co-signature is needed "if patient is 14+ years of age." Form-1 distinguishes between substance use (12+) and mental health/psychiatry (14+). The blanket 14+ threshold in form-2 may not correctly reflect Wisconsin law for substance use disorder records, which under Wisconsin statutes allows minors aged 12+ to consent to their own treatment.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **54 fillable fields.** The form was intentionally designed as a fillable PDF with a substantial number of interactive fields. The filename explicitly advertises this ("Fillable"). For a small FQHC, this represents above-average digital investment.
- **Granular record type selection.** The form offers unusually detailed record type checkboxes, including separate options for entire medical, dental, mental health, substance use disorder, and psych med management files — plus individual record categories. This gives patients meaningful control over the scope of their request.
- **Verbal revocation acknowledged.** The form explicitly states patients can revoke authorization "in writing or verbally," which is more patient-friendly than forms that require only written revocation.
