# Evaluation: King's Daughters Medical Center (Brookhaven, MS) — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**form-1.pdf is not a Release of Information form.** It is a "JOINT NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES" — a standard HIPAA-mandated Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP). The document opens with: *"JOINT NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES — Your Rights. Our Responsibilities. This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information."*

This is the wrong document type for the purposes of this study. An NPP is a required disclosure document that informs patients of their rights; it is not an authorization or request form that a patient would fill out to obtain their records.

The second document retrieved (form-2.pdf) is an "Employer Authorization form" for occupational health services (DOT physicals, drug testing, etc.) — also not a patient-facing ROI form.

**No actual ROI/authorization form was found on kdmc.org.** The retrieval notes document an exhaustive search: multiple web queries, full site navigation, and a complete inventory of all PDFs hosted on the domain. The organization handles medical records requests exclusively through a third-party vendor, Datavant (formerly Swellbox), via an online wizard at `https://www.swellbox.com/kings-daughters-mc-wizard.html`. There is no downloadable PDF authorization form available to patients.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Since no ROI form exists as a downloadable document, findability must be assessed in two frames:

**Finding the NPP (form-1.pdf):** The Notice of Privacy Practices is linked from the website and was discoverable via site navigation and search. Its URL (`/documents/KDMC-Joint-Notice-of-Privacy-Practices.pdf`) has a descriptive filename.

**Finding the records request process:** According to the notes, the website has an "Online Medical Record Request" page that redirects to the Datavant/Swellbox wizard. This is findable but represents a fundamentally different model — patients never see or download an authorization form. The retrieval process was rated "Hard" by the search agent, partly due to name confusion with King's Daughters Health System in Ashland, KY (an entirely separate organization at kingsdaughtershealth.com).

**Fees are disclosed in the Datavant process:** The notes indicate a $6.50 flat fee + $0.12 per page, with records fulfilled by Datavant and requiring photo ID for pickup. None of this information appears in the NPP itself.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**As a PDF artifact, the NPP is competently produced:**
- **Text layer:** Present and fully extractable (8,850 characters).
- **Fillable fields:** Zero — appropriate for an informational notice, which requires no patient input.
- **File size:** 528,953 bytes (529 KB) for a single page, which is moderately large — likely due to the 1 embedded image (probably an organizational logo). Not unreasonable but could be optimized.
- **Fonts:** 6 fonts embedded.
- **Scan status:** Not an image-only scan; this is a digitally-authored document.
- **Page count:** 1 page, which is compact for an NPP (many are 8–12 pages).

The document functions well as a digital artifact, though it is irrelevant to the ROI process.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The NPP uses a clean, readable structure with clear headings and bullet points. It follows the HHS model Notice of Privacy Practices template closely, organizing content into:
- "Your Rights" (8 bullet items)
- "Your Choices" (with sub-categories)
- "Our Uses and Disclosures" (with examples)
- "Our Responsibilities"

**Clarity:** The language is plain and accessible — e.g., *"Get a copy of your paper or electronic medical record"* rather than legal jargon. The use of "Example:" callouts (e.g., *"A doctor treating you for an injury asks another doctor about your overall health condition"*) aids comprehension.

**Length:** Impressively condensed into a single page. Most NPPs span many pages; fitting the full content into one page suggests either very small font or aggressive condensation. Given that the extracted text runs to 8,850 characters, the text is likely quite dense on the page.

**Dates:** Effective 09/23/2013, revised 05/06/2021 — reasonably current.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**This document fails the patient-centeredness test for records access because it is not an ROI form.** It does mention the right of access: *"You can ask to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and other health information we have about you. Ask us how to do this."* However, the instruction is vague — "Ask us how to do this" provides no concrete next step, no link to the Datavant wizard, no phone number for HIM, and no mention of the online request process.

The NPP does reference several patient rights:
- Right to obtain copies of medical records ("usually within 30 days")
- Right to request corrections ("within 60 days")
- Right to request confidential communications
- Right to request restrictions on use/sharing
- Right to an accounting of disclosures
- Right to file complaints (Privacy Officer at 601-835-9335; HHS OCR contact info provided)

**What's missing:** The NPP does not reference the Datavant/Swellbox online portal, does not explain how to actually initiate a records request, does not mention fees, and does not link to any ROI form. A patient reading this document would know they *have* the right to access records but would not know *how* to exercise that right — a critical gap.

**No mention of:** Electronic delivery options, EHI export, or HIPAA § 164.524 by citation.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**The NPP itself poses no compliance issues** — it is a standard, well-constructed notice. However, the broader records access picture raises questions:

- **Third-party vendor model:** KDMC has outsourced medical records fulfillment entirely to Datavant. While this is common and not inherently problematic, the **fee structure ($6.50 flat + $0.12/page)** disclosed in the retrieval notes may warrant scrutiny. Under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524), fees for patient access must be limited to reasonable, cost-based fees for labor of copying. The per-page charge model is a legacy approach that has drawn OCR enforcement attention.
- **No downloadable form:** The absence of any downloadable authorization form means patients must use the Datavant online wizard. While an online process can be more convenient, it also means patients who lack internet access or who prefer paper have no self-service option discoverable on the website.
- **Photo ID for pickup:** The notes mention photo ID is required, which is a standard identity verification practice.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **No ROI form exists anywhere on the organization's website.** The entire records request process has been outsourced to Datavant/Swellbox, a third-party vendor. While the online wizard may be functional, the complete absence of a downloadable form means patients cannot review the authorization terms before engaging with the vendor system, and patients without internet access have no self-service path.
- **Fee structure concern:** The disclosed fee of $6.50 flat + $0.12 per page (from the Datavant process) follows a per-page model that OCR has specifically criticized in Right of Access enforcement actions. HIPAA limits patient access fees to reasonable, cost-based amounts.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- The NPP says *"Ask us how to do this"* when describing how to exercise the right to copies — but provides no specific instructions, phone number for HIM, or link to the online request process. The only contact information in the document is the Privacy Officer phone number (601-835-9335) for complaints, not for records requests.
- The NPP's instruction that *"We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information, usually within 30 days"* uses the word "summary" without clarifying that patients have the right to the full record, not just a summary, under HIPAA's Right of Access.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Wrong document evaluated:** form-1.pdf is a Notice of Privacy Practices, not an ROI form. This is not an error in the document itself but means this evaluation cannot assess the actual ROI process. The organization simply does not publish an ROI form.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Concise, plain-language NPP:** The single-page format with clear bullet points and examples is notably better than many multi-page, legalese-heavy NPPs. The language is accessible and well-organized.
- **Online records request option exists:** While the implementation via Datavant raises questions, the fact that KDMC offers any online request pathway (versus requiring in-person visits or mailed forms) is a positive signal for a small community hospital.
