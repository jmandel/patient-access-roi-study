## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an English-language general HIPAA authorization form for releasing protected health information. It is Form #1862, revised April 2018. The form is a single page and covers release from any of three UMMC facility locations (Jackson, Grenada, Lexington) plus a "Clinic/Other" write-in option.

A companion document exists: form-1.pdf is a Spanish-language version of the same form (Form #1862 Rev. 05/2025), which is notably more recent and includes an additional Madison location. The English form appears to be an older version that has since been updated — but the updated English version is no longer accessible online. The Spanish version was retrieved from the Wayback Machine, while this English version was only available from a third-party caching site (pdf4pro.com).

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **extremely difficult to locate**. The retrieval notes document a multi-step process:

- The canonical URL on the UMMC website (`/common/files/ummch/Health/Forms/release-of-medical-information.pdf`) returns **HTTP 404**. An older URL (`/Compliance/files/thefinalauthorizationform.pdf`) also returns 404.
- The Wayback Machine never archived the English PDF, despite archiving the HTML pages that link to it.
- The form was ultimately obtained from **pdf4pro.com**, a third-party PDF hosting site that had cached a copy. This is not a source a typical patient would find or trust.

The UMMC website does have a "Release Form" page under Healthcare > Patients and Visitors, and the form is also referenced from a Compliance > HIPAA Forms page — so the intended navigation paths exist, but **the destination links are broken**. A patient visiting today would reach a dead end. The URL and filename (`release-of-medical-information.pdf`) are descriptive and well-named, but that's moot when the file is missing.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (3,944 characters). This is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero** interactive form fields (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite having a text layer, the form cannot be filled electronically. Patients must print and hand-write entries.
- **Page count**: 1 page — compact.
- **File size**: 137 KB — reasonable for a single-page PDF.
- **PDF version**: 1.5.
- **Fonts**: 6 fonts embedded.
- **Images**: 0 embedded images.

The form was clearly created digitally (not a scan), as evidenced by the clean text extraction and absence of embedded images. However, the complete lack of fillable fields makes it a **print-and-fill document**. This is a missed opportunity — the Spanish version (form-1.pdf, Rev. 05/2025) has **70 fillable fields**, suggesting UMMC has since modernized the form but only the Spanish version remains accessible online.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure and organization**: The single page is divided into logical sections: location selection, patient information, release recipient information, purpose of release, PHI to be released (with checkboxes for specific record types), sensitive information release, patient's rights, and signature block. The flow is top-to-bottom and reasonably intuitive.

**Record type granularity**: The form provides 14 specific record type options including "Occupational Therapy Notes," "Radiology Reports," "History & Physical," "Dental Records," "Radiology Images," "Operative Report," "Entire Medical Record," "ER Report," "Progress Notes," "Immunization Record," "Discharge Summary," "Physical Therapy Notes," "Laboratory Reports," and an "Other" write-in. A parenthetical note clarifies that "Entire Medical Record (Does Not Include Images)." This is a reasonable level of granularity.

**Format options**: Three delivery format options are offered: "Paper," "Electronic," and "View Access as scheduled." The inclusion of electronic delivery is positive, though there is no further specification of what "Electronic" means (email? portal? CD?).

**Purpose options**: Six pre-printed purposes are listed: Personal, Legal/Attorney, Insurance, Disability, Continuing Care, School, Worker's Compensation, plus an "Other" write-in. "Personal" as a listed purpose is helpful for patients seeking their own records.

**Date range**: The form allows specifying "Service Dates: From ___ To ___" and an optional "Information Needed By" date — a useful feature.

**Language**: The Patient's Rights section is a dense single paragraph of legal text. Key statements include: "This authorization will expire 6 months from the date of signature," "I understand that information used or disclosed pursuant to this authorization may be subject to re-disclosure by the recipient," and "UMMC will not condition my treatment on giving this authorization." While these are important disclosures, the wall-of-text formatting makes them difficult to parse. No bullet points or bold text break up the rights section.

**Fitting everything on one page** comes at the cost of cramped layout. The rights section in particular is dense and hard to read.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This is a **general-purpose release form**, not one specifically designed for patient access to their own records. The form's framing — "Release to:" with a recipient address block — is oriented toward third-party disclosure. However, "Personal" is listed as a purpose option, and the form does not require specifying a third-party recipient in a way that would block a patient requesting records for themselves.

**Sensitive information handling**: The form properly separates sensitive categories (Substance Abuse Treatment, Mental Health, HIV-related information, Genetic Testing, Other Abuse) and requires individual initials for each. This is compliant with federal and state requirements for heightened protections on these categories.

**SSN collection**: The form asks for the patient's full Social Security Number. This is unnecessary for a records release and raises privacy concerns — collecting SSN on a form that must be printed and mailed/faxed increases the risk of identity theft.

**No HIPAA Right of Access reference**: The form does not cite 45 CFR § 164.524 or otherwise inform patients of their specific right to access their own records. There is no mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

**No submission instructions**: The form lacks any guidance on where or how to submit it (fax number, mailing address, email, or portal). A patient would need to separately find this information. The only address mentioned is for revoking authorization (UMMC, Attention: Office of Integrity & Compliance, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216-4505), not for submitting the initial request.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**6-month expiration**: The authorization expires "6 months from the date of signature." For a patient requesting their own records, this is a reasonable timeframe. However, for ongoing third-party releases, 6 months is relatively short.

**Witness requirement**: The form requires a witness signature in addition to the patient's signature. HIPAA does not require a witness for a patient's own authorization to release records. This adds a procedural barrier — patients filling out the form at home must find someone to witness their signature.

**Incompleteness rejection**: The form states prominently: "* Forms that are not complete will not be accepted by UMMC. *" This creates a rigid completeness standard that could be used to reject forms with minor omissions, delaying patient access.

**Representative documentation**: The form includes proper provisions for representatives signing on behalf of patients, including minors (parent/guardian/in loco parentis) and states the signer must "warrant that I have the legal authority to act on behalf of the patient."

**Revocation process**: Revocation instructions are provided — send written notice with signature and date to the Office of Integrity & Compliance. This is appropriate but requires written/mailed notice only.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Witness signature required**: The form demands "Witness" with a signature line and date. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient authorizations. This is an extra burden that could delay or discourage patients from submitting requests, particularly those without easy access to another person.

- **Full SSN collected**: The form includes a field for "SSN" (Social Security Number). Collecting full SSN on a printable, faxable form is a security risk and is not required for processing a records request. Most modern forms use medical record number or date of birth for identification.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no fax number, email address, mailing address (for initial submission), or portal link. A patient has no way to know how to return the completed form. The only address on the form is for revocation, not submission.

- **"View Access as scheduled"**: The delivery format option "View Access as scheduled" is undefined. It's unclear what this means — an in-person appointment to view records? A scheduled portal access window? This term is not explained anywhere on the form.

- **"Electronic" format undefined**: Choosing "Electronic" delivery provides no clarity on the medium — email, secure portal, CD/USB, or something else.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Primary English form link is broken (404)**: The canonical URL on the UMMC website returns a 404 error. The form is effectively **unpublished**. This is not a minor issue — it means the English-speaking patient population of a major teaching hospital cannot access the ROI form from the organization's own website.

- **Outdated version**: This is Rev. 04/2018, while the Spanish version is Rev. 05/2025. The English form is 7 years older and missing the Madison location. The fact that only an outdated cached copy is available compounds the broken-link problem.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish-language version available**: UMMC provides a Spanish translation of the form (form-1.pdf), which is a meaningful accessibility accommodation — though the irony is that the Spanish version is currently *more* accessible than the English one.

- **Granular record-type selection**: The 14 specific record categories plus "Other" give patients meaningful control over what is released, rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice.

- **"Personal" as a listed purpose**: Including "Personal" among the pre-printed purpose options legitimizes patient self-access and avoids forcing patients to categorize their own records request under an ill-fitting label.
