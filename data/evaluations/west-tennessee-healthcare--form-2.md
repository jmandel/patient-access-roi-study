# West Tennessee Healthcare — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-2.pdf is titled **"AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION"** and is a third-party release authorization form. It is one of three ROI-related documents found for West Tennessee Healthcare:

- **form-1.pdf** — "Medical Release Authorization," an older (2019) form specific to West Tennessee Medical Group Clinics, allowing a physician/provider/nurse or staff to discuss care with designated individuals.
- **form-2.pdf** (this document) — "Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information," a 2020 general third-party release authorization.
- **form-3.pdf** — "Request for Access to Protected Health Information," a 2020 patient-specific access request form explicitly subtitled "(To be used when patient wants to access their own medical record or allow a personal representative to do so.)"

West Tennessee Healthcare distinguishes between patient access (form-3) and third-party release (form-2). This document — form-2 — is designed for situations where someone other than the patient (e.g., an attorney, insurer, or another provider) initiates a records request, though its language does not explicitly restrict it to third-party use. The URL path (`AUTH-2020.pdf`) and the notes confirm it was uploaded in May 2020.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was **easy to find**. Per the retrieval notes, the first web search for `West Tennessee Healthcare "authorization" "release" "health information" medical records form` returned direct PDF links. All three forms are linked from a clearly labeled medical records page at https://www.wth.org/request-medical-records/. The URL itself (`/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AUTH-2020.pdf`) is a standard WordPress media upload path — not especially descriptive, but the page context makes it clear what the form is for. Spanish-language versions of both form-2 and form-3 are also linked from the same page. Retrieval difficulty was rated "easy."

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The full extracted text is 4,025 characters and reads cleanly — this is a digitally-created document, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero**. Despite being a digital PDF, there are no interactive form fields. A patient must print, fill by hand, and submit.
- **File size**: 23,126 bytes (23 KB) for a single page — appropriately small, with no embedded images.
- **Fonts**: 4 fonts used.
- **Image-only scan**: No. This is a natively digital PDF.
- **Digital-first design**: **No.** While the document has a text layer and was created digitally, the absence of any fillable fields means it functions as a print-and-fill form. There are blank lines and underscores for handwritten entries (e.g., `"Other:_________________________"`), confirming it was designed for pen-and-paper completion.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 1 page. For a third-party release authorization, this is compact — it fits identification fields, purpose of disclosure, method of disclosure, record type selection, and seven numbered "I understand" clauses all on a single page. This is efficient but results in a dense layout.

**Clarity**: The language is predominantly legal/regulatory. The seven numbered clauses use complex sentence structures. For example, clause 6 reads: "My signed (written) authorization will expire in ninety (90) days unless I provide an alternate expiration date or event. This authorization will not apply to any dates of service that occur after the date this authorization is signed." This is reasonably clear for a legal document but not plain language.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient identification → releasing entity → recipient → purpose → delivery method → record types → legal clauses → signature. Sections are not labeled with headers, however — the form moves directly from one field cluster to the next, relying on field labels and layout to guide the user.

**Record type selection**: Offers 15 specific record categories via an initialing system ("please initial beside documents"): All Dictated Reports, Lab, Radiology Reports, Pertinent Summary, Pathology Reports, ER Record, Anesthesia Record, Billing Record, Entire Chart, Photographs/Images, History & Physical, Discharge Summary, Consultation, Operative/Procedure Report, and Other. This provides granular control.

**Font size**: Text appears to be 8-10pt range given the density of content on a single page — the seven numbered legal clauses in particular are likely at the small end of readability.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This form is **not** a patient access form. West Tennessee Healthcare provides a separate form (form-3, "Request for Access to Protected Health Information") explicitly for patients requesting their own records. Form-2 is titled "Authorization for Release" and is structured around disclosing information *to* a named third party. However, the form does not include clear header text explaining who should use it (unlike form-3, which has an explicit parenthetical subtitle).

**Scope options**: The form offers good granularity — patients/requestors can specify dates of treatment, place of treatment (Inpatient, Emergency Room, Outpatient, Other), and select from 15 record categories. There is also an "Other (specify)" option.

**Format/delivery options**: The form offers multiple delivery methods: Paper, Facsimile, Password Protected CD or DVD, and E-mail with a choice of Secure/Encrypted or Unsecure/Unencrypted. The email option includes a risk disclosure: "Note if sending unsecured/unencrypted e-mail over the internet, there is some level of risk that the information could be read or otherwise accessed by a third party while in transit." This is good practice, though the patient portal option available on form-3 is absent here.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or patient rights. It references the "Notice of Privacy Practices" in clause 1 and mentions "federal privacy regulations" in clause 2, but does not cite specific HIPAA provisions.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Social Security Number**: The form asks for "SS No.: (Last 4 digits only)" — requesting only the last four digits is a reasonable privacy measure, though SSN collection on an ROI form at all is worth noting.

**Driver's License**: The form states "Drivers License No. (only required if you are NOT requesting records in person)" — this creates an implicit preference for in-person requests and adds an identification burden for remote requests.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: Clause 6 states the authorization "will expire in ninety (90) days unless I provide an alternate expiration date or event." A 90-day default is on the shorter side, which could require patients to re-authorize if processing takes time, though the option to specify an alternate expiration mitigates this.

**Liability waiver**: Clause 4 reads: "The facility is hereby released from any liability and the undersigned will hold the facility harmless for complying with this authorization." This hold-harmless clause is common but places legal burden on the patient.

**No conditioning**: Clause 5 appropriately states: "The facility will not condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits on whether I sign this authorization, except for research related purposes and as otherwise permitted under applicable law."

**42 CFR Part 2**: Clause 3 addresses substance abuse and HIV/AIDS records, bundling consent to release these sensitive categories into the general authorization: "I hereby authorize the release of information. This authorization also includes any information related to diagnosis and/or treatment of any psychiatric or mental illness or any state of infection with the HIV (AIDS) virus."

**Fees**: No fee schedule or cost information is disclosed on the form.

**Marketing clause**: Clause 7 includes a marketing-related provision requiring the WTH Privacy Coordinator to sign if PHI will be used for marketing with remuneration. This references "JMCGH" (Jackson-Madison County General Hospital), suggesting this form template is specific to that facility within the West Tennessee Healthcare system.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Bundled sensitive-records consent**: Clause 3 automatically includes authorization to release substance abuse (42 CFR Part 2), psychiatric/mental health, and HIV/AIDS records as part of the general authorization, rather than requiring separate, explicit consent for each category. Under 42 CFR Part 2, substance abuse treatment records typically require a more specific authorization than a blanket inclusion clause.

- **90-day default expiration**: While patients can specify an alternate date, the 90-day default is short and could force patients to re-submit if processing is delayed. HIPAA does not require authorizations to have expiration dates this aggressive.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Who should use this form?** Unlike form-3 (which has a clear parenthetical: "To be used when patient wants to access their own medical record"), form-2 has no guidance on who it is intended for. A patient could easily select this form instead of the patient-access form (form-3), potentially subjecting themselves to a different process and different terms (e.g., no portal delivery option, the 90-day expiration clause).

- **Driver's license requirement for remote requests**: The statement "Drivers License No. (only required if you are NOT requesting records in person)" implies non-in-person requests require a driver's license number, but doesn't explain alternatives for individuals who don't have a driver's license.

- **"JMCGH" reference in clause 7**: The marketing clause references "JMCGH" by name, but the form header says "West Tennessee Healthcare" — it's unclear whether this form applies system-wide or only to Jackson-Madison County General Hospital.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Inconsistent entity name**: Clause 7 states "I hereby certify that JMCGH will receive remuneration" — "JMCGH" (Jackson-Madison County General Hospital) appears nowhere else in the form and is not defined. The rest of the form uses "the facility" as its generic term. This appears to be a template error where a facility-specific name was not generalized.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Separate forms for patient access vs. third-party release**: West Tennessee Healthcare maintains distinct forms (form-2 for third-party authorization, form-3 for patient access), which is better practice than forcing patients through a third-party release process to access their own records.

- **Granular record type selection**: The 15-category record selection with an "Other" option gives requestors meaningful control over what is disclosed, rather than an all-or-nothing approach.

- **Encrypted/unencrypted email choice with risk disclosure**: Offering email delivery with a clear explanation of encryption risks shows awareness of modern delivery preferences and informed consent around security tradeoffs.

- **Spanish-language versions available**: Per the retrieval notes, Spanish versions of this form are linked from the medical records page, improving accessibility for non-English speakers.
