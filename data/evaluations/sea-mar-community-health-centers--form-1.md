## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is Sea Mar's sole ROI/authorization form, titled "Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information" and subtitled "Health Information Management Department." The filename ("ROI COPY 2022 PDF.pdf") indicates a 2022 version. It is a general-purpose authorization form designed for both third-party release and patient-initiated requests — the "From" and "To" fields are provider-agnostic, and the "Purpose of the release" options include "At my request," "Transfer of Care," "Verbal Disclosure," and a write-in "Other" field. No other ROI forms were found for this organization.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was easy to locate. A straightforward web search for `Sea Mar Community Health Centers "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` returned a direct link to the PDF on the first attempt. A site-scoped search (`site:seamar.org`) confirmed this is the only ROI form published. The URL is on the organization's primary domain (`seamar.org/dl/...`) but the filename is not especially descriptive — "ROI COPY 2022 PDF.pdf" uses the acronym "ROI" which most patients would not recognize. There was no bot blocking, login wall, or CAPTCHA. The notes do not mention whether the form is linked from a patient-facing "Medical Records" or "Patient Resources" page, though the direct PDF URL was immediately discoverable via search.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present and fully extractable (3,856 characters). This is not a scanned image.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero interactive/fillable form fields. The PDF contains blank lines and underscores for handwriting, meaning patients must print, fill by hand, and return physically (or annotate the PDF with external tools).
- **Page count**: 1 page — compact, though densely packed.
- **File size**: 192 KB for a single-page document with 2 embedded images and 6 fonts — reasonable.
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is a print-oriented form. The layout uses underscores (`_______`) for handwritten entries and initial lines (`___`) for checkbox-style initials. There are no clickable checkboxes, radio buttons, or text input fields. A patient cannot complete this form digitally without a PDF annotation tool.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length & proportionality**: The form fits on a single page, which is commendable for brevity. However, the amount of content packed into one page creates density issues.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient Information → From → To → Information to be released → Sensitive Information → Consent of Minors → Purpose → Expiration → Patient Rights → Signature → Staff Use. This sequencing is reasonable.

**Clarity**: The form uses some plain language but mixes in legal/clinical terminology. For example, "Title 42 of the United States code, stipulates this information cannot be released without Authorization by law" is stated without further explanation of what Title 42 is. The instruction "Please initial one section" under "Information to be released" is potentially confusing — there are actually six initialing lines in that section, and some appear to be independent options (e.g., "All records" vs. "Lab Results" vs. "Mental Health Records") that patients might want to combine.

**Record type options**: The form offers granular options:
- Recent summary of care (with a detailed sub-list: "Medication List, Problem List, Last three H&P/Progress Notes, Recent Imaging, Immunizations, Last Pap Smear, Last Mammogram, Last Colonoscopy, EKG, Recent lab work, MH Intake, SUD Assessment")
- Dental Records & Dental X-Rays only
- The most recent two years of records
- Other (write-in)
- All records (with a notable caveat: "excludes Sensitive Patient Information listed below")
- Lab Results (with date/test specification)
- Mental Health Records (with date/diagnosis specification)

**Method of disclosure**: Offers "In-Clinic," "Verbal," "CD," "Paper," and "Fax" — with the parenthetical instruction "(please mail if over 40 pages)." No electronic/email/portal delivery option is listed.

**Layout/readability**: The form uses 6 fonts and has a structured table-like layout with labeled sections on the left. Text appears to be at a readable size, but the single-page compression means minimal whitespace.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is a general-purpose authorization, not specifically designed for patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access. The "Purpose of the release" options include "At my request" — the closest option for a patient requesting their own records — alongside "Transfer of Care" and "Verbal Disclosure." The form does not distinguish between a patient exercising their right of access (which has specific HIPAA protections including fee limits and 30-day response requirements) and a third-party release authorization (which operates under different rules).

**Scope options**: Good. Patients can select specific record types, write in date ranges for lab results and mental health records, and choose "Other" for custom requests.

**Format/delivery options**: Limited. The five delivery methods (In-Clinic, Verbal, CD, Paper, Fax) are all non-electronic. There is no option for email, secure portal, or electronic download. The notes mention Sea Mar offers MyChart at `seamar.org/ohr/index.php`, but the form makes no reference to the patient portal as a delivery channel.

**Patient rights statement**: Present but generic. The form states: "I understand that I do not have to sign this authorization in order to get health care benefits (treatment, payment, or enrollment). I understand I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time." This is standard HIPAA authorization language but does not reference the specific Right of Access under 45 CFR § 164.524, nor does it inform patients of their right to receive records in their requested format, the fee limitations, or the 30-day response timeline.

**EHI export / bulk data**: No mention.

---

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: The default expiration is 90 days from signing unless the patient selects an alternative: "When revoked in writing," "One year from the date of signature," "When Records Received," or a custom date/event. The 90-day default is short but not unreasonable for a general authorization. However, for a patient access request (as distinct from a third-party authorization), expiration is not typically relevant — patients have an ongoing right to access records.

**Fee disclosure**: No fees are mentioned anywhere on the form. This is neither positive nor negative on its own, but leaves patients uninformed about potential costs.

**Submission method**: The form does not specify how to submit it. There is no mailing address, fax number, or email address for returning the completed form. The "Staff Use Only" section at the bottom (with checkboxes for "Verified all sections are complete" and "I have completed all actions. Scan this form to the patient's chart") suggests the form is expected to be completed in-clinic, in front of staff.

**Sensitive information protections**: The form properly separates sensitive information (HIV/AIDS, Substance Abuse, STDs, Mental Health/Psychiatry) and requires explicit initialing. It correctly references Title 42 for substance use disorder records and includes a separate minor consent section (ages 13-17) consistent with Washington State law for reproductive health (age 14+), substance abuse (age 13+), and mental health (age 13+).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No electronic submission or delivery pathway**: The form offers only physical delivery methods (In-Clinic, Verbal, CD, Paper, Fax) with no email, portal, or electronic option. The "Staff Use Only" section and lack of any return address strongly imply in-person submission is expected. This creates a barrier for patients who cannot visit a clinic to submit the form or pick up records.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Please initial one section" vs. six options**: The instruction under "Information to be released" says "Please initial one section," but there are six initialing lines, some of which could logically be combined (e.g., a patient might want both Lab Results and Mental Health Records). It's unclear whether patients are truly limited to one selection or whether the instruction is a careless holdover.
- **"All records (excludes Sensitive Patient Information listed below)"**: This exclusion is stated but not well-explained. A patient checking "All records" might reasonably expect to receive all records. The mechanism to include sensitive information (initialing in the separate section below) is not clearly cross-referenced, and a patient could easily miss this two-step requirement.
- **Patient access vs. third-party authorization conflation**: The form does not distinguish between these two legally distinct request types. A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access has different protections (fee limits, format choice, 30-day deadline) than someone authorizing release to a third party. Using a single form for both creates ambiguity about which rules apply.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Title 42 reference is imprecise**: The form states "Title 42 of the United States code, stipulates this information cannot be released without Authorization by law." Title 42 is enormously broad (it covers all of Public Health). The specific reference should be to 42 CFR Part 2 (Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records). The vague citation provides no actionable information to patients.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Granular record type options**: The "Recent summary of care" option itemizes specific components (Medication List, Problem List, Progress Notes, Imaging, Immunizations, screening results, etc.), giving patients a clear picture of what they'll receive — better than a vague "summary" checkbox.
- **Minor consent section aligned with state law**: The form includes a well-structured section for minors ages 13-17 to authorize release of their own sensitive information, with age thresholds that align with Washington State's mature minor doctrine (age 14 for reproductive health/STDs, age 13 for substance abuse and mental health).
- **Easy to find online**: The form was discoverable on the first search attempt with no access barriers — no login walls, CAPTCHAs, or bot blocking.
