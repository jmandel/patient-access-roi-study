# Evaluation: Bayshore Medical Center — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3.pdf is the **Spanish-language version** of the Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) system-wide Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information, form ID **CMR-003S**, dated 12-20-23. Its title is "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA USAR O DIVULGAR INFORMACIÓN MÉDICA PROTEGIDA." It is the direct Spanish translation of form-6.pdf (CMR-003), the English-language counterpart.

This form is one of six documents retrieved for Bayshore Medical Center. The full set includes:
- **form-1.pdf**: HMH Medical Group (outpatient) ROI form (English, 1 page, dated March 2018)
- **form-2.pdf**: Pascack Valley Medical Center ROI form (image-only scan, sister facility)
- **form-3.pdf** ← this document (Spanish hospital-level ROI, CMR-003S)
- **form-4.pdf**: Request for Amendment of PHI
- **form-5.pdf**: Pascack Valley patient-request form
- **form-6.pdf**: English hospital-level ROI (CMR-003) — the primary English equivalent

Form-3 is a system-wide form covering all HMH hospital campuses. It lists Bayshore Medical Center explicitly among 11 facilities with campus-specific contact information (phone: 732-739-5933/5985, fax: 732-888-7332).

## 2. FINDABILITY

This Spanish-language form was **more discoverable than its English counterpart**. Per the retrieval notes, the HMH system-wide Medical Records page (`/en/patients-and-visitors/medical-records`) directly links to the Spanish ROI PDF but does *not* link to the English PDF version. English-speaking patients are instead directed to a Swellbox/Datavant online wizard. The Spanish form's URL is straightforward: `hackensackmeridianhealth.org/-/media/project/hmh/hmh/public/files/patients-visitors/roi-request-form-2024-spanish.pdf`.

The form was found through the "Spanish" link on the Medical Records page — a single click from a page that is itself reachable from the Bayshore Medical Center Patient & Visitor Information section. The URL contains "patients-visitors" in the path, which is the expected location. However, the form's filename (`roi-request-form-2024-spanish.pdf`) doesn't clearly describe its contents to a Spanish-speaking user who might download it.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. Full extracted text is 6,890 characters across 2 pages. The text is selectable and searchable.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (0). The form has no interactive form fields — patients must print and fill by hand.
- **File size**: 93,945 bytes (~94 KB) for 2 pages with no embedded images — reasonable and lightweight.
- **Font count**: 5 fonts embedded.
- **PDF format**: Clean digital-origin document (not a scan). No embedded images, indicating this was created natively in a layout tool rather than scanned from paper.
- **Digital-first design**: Despite being a natively digital PDF, it is designed as a **print-and-fill document**. All fields are blank lines or checkboxes rendered as static text characters ("n" bullets used as checkbox placeholders). There are no interactive elements.

The form is technically sound as a flat PDF but misses the opportunity to be fillable, which would be especially helpful for Spanish-speaking patients who may face additional barriers in the healthcare system.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages, proportionate to the content. Page 1 contains the authorization fields; page 2 contains disclosures, additional signature lines, fee information, and a comprehensive contact directory for all 11 HMH campuses.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical sequence: patient identification → recipient information → location of services → information to be released → purpose → sensitive records consent → minor consent → signature → delivery format → EHI Export option → page 2 disclosures → contact directory. However, the "Formato requerido" (delivery format) section appears *after* the signature block on page 1, which is an unusual ordering that could cause patients to miss it.

**Language**: The form is written entirely in Spanish. The translation is generally competent but contains some grammatical errors. The 42 CFR Part 2 prohibition notice has notably awkward phrasing: "Las normas federales le prohíbe que el receptor esta información realizar otras divulgaciones de esta la misma" — this sentence has verb conjugation errors ("prohíbe" should be "prohíben") and garbled syntax ("de esta la misma"). This section is critical legal language, and the translation quality is poor.

**Facility listing**: The form uses "n" characters as checkbox markers for location selection, which extracts readably but some facility names appear with inconsistent labeling. For example, some entries on page 2 have "Centro médico" prefixed (e.g., "Centro médico universitario JFK University Medical Center") while others do not, and facility names remain mostly in English — a mixed-language approach.

**Readability**: Section headers are clear. The minor consent section contains a dense paragraph explaining age requirements (age 13+) for reproductive health, drug/alcohol, and mental health records, which is appropriately detailed.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This form is framed as a **general authorization to "divulgar" (disclose)** information. It says "Autorizo a Hackensack Meridian Health a divulgar información a:" — directing the patient to specify a recipient. It does not distinguish between patient self-access and third-party release. However, the "Propósito de divulgación" (Purpose) section includes "Uso individual" (personal use) as an option, suggesting patient access is contemplated.

**Scope options**: Good. The form offers:
- Date range selection ("de: ... a:")
- 10 record-type checkboxes: clinical notes, operative/procedure notes, therapeutic services reports, lab/pathology reports, discharge summaries, ED records, radiology images, radiology reports, drug/alcohol records, abstracts, plus an "Otro" (other) write-in
- Purpose checkboxes: continuing care, personal use, transfer to another provider, legal, other

**Delivery format options**: The form offers four delivery formats: "Papel" (paper), "Copia electrónica (USB cifrado, CD)" (electronic copy), fax, and "Correo electrónico seguro" (secured email). This is a good range of options.

**EHI Export**: Notably, the form includes an EHI Export option: "La función EHI Export permite exportar sus registros médicos en un formato que se puede leer electrónicamente, de manera que se pueden cargar en otro Registro Médico Electrónico (EHR, por sus siglas en inglés)." Patients initial a line to request this. This is a forward-looking feature.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access. It states disclosure is "voluntario" (voluntary) and notes the patient need not sign to assure treatment or payment, but does not affirmatively inform the patient of their *right* to obtain their records.

**Spanish-language availability**: The very existence of this form is a patient-centeredness positive — providing a Spanish version of the ROI form is important for the significant Spanish-speaking population in New Jersey.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration**: "Esta autorización expirará un año después de la fecha firmada a continuación, a menos que se indique aquí otra fecha o acontecimiento." One year is a reasonable default expiration, and the form allows the patient to specify a different date/event.

**Voluntary disclosure**: The form clearly states: "Autorizar la divulgación de esta información de salud es un acto voluntario. No necesito firmar este documento para asegurarme de recibir el tratamiento o el pago del servicio."

**Revocation**: Patients are informed they can cancel at any time in writing to the HMH Health Information Management Department.

**Fees**: The form states "Es posible que se aplique una tarifa por la copia de la historia clínica. Solicite información sobre las tarifas al personal de Administración de Información Médica." This acknowledges fees may apply but does not disclose amounts, directing patients to ask HIM staff. This is vague but not necessarily non-compliant.

**Sensitive records**: The form appropriately separates consent for sensitive categories (reproductive health, STDs, HIV/AIDS, mental health, alcohol/drug abuse) requiring specific authorization, consistent with federal 42 CFR Part 2 and NJ state law.

**No notarization required**: The form requires only a patient signature.

**No in-person requirement stated**: The form does not mandate in-person submission, though it also doesn't explicitly state how to submit (mail, fax, in-person, or electronically).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
*(none identified)*

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Submission method unclear**: The form provides campus contact phone/fax numbers but does not explicitly state *how* the completed form should be submitted. Patients would need to infer they can fax it to the listed fax number, or call to ask.
- **Fee disclosure is opaque**: "Es posible que se aplique una tarifa" — fees *may* apply but no schedule or range is given. For a patient exercising their HIPAA right of access, fees are limited to a reasonable cost-based fee. The vagueness could deter patients from requesting records.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Garbled legal text in 42 CFR Part 2 notice**: The sentence "Las normas federales le prohíbe que el receptor esta información realizar otras divulgaciones de esta la misma" contains multiple grammatical errors — incorrect verb conjugation ("prohíbe" vs. "prohíben"), garbled demonstrative pronouns ("de esta la misma"), and an unclear subject-object structure. This is the most critical legal paragraph on the form and is rendered nearly unintelligible in Spanish.
- **"Carrier Clinic" listed twice** in the facility location checkboxes on page 1: it appears as both the 3rd and 10th option in the location list, which is a data entry error carried over from the English version (form-6).

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Spanish-language availability**: Providing a full Spanish translation of the hospital-level ROI form is a meaningful accessibility measure, particularly given New Jersey's large Spanish-speaking population (~16% of state residents). This was the *only* PDF directly linked from the HMH Medical Records page.
- **EHI Export option in Spanish**: The form includes the EHI Export machine-readable format option with a clear Spanish explanation. This is rare even on English-language forms and demonstrates forward-thinking digital health literacy outreach.
- **Comprehensive contact directory**: Page 2 provides phone and fax numbers for all 11 HMH campuses, allowing patients to contact the correct HIM department directly regardless of which facility they visited.
