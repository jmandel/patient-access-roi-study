# Evaluation: Arizona Community Physicians — form-6.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is the **Spanish-language version of the "Minor Release of Information Form"** (Form 116, revised 03/24/2023), titled "Formulario de divulgación de información para un menor." It is a direct translation of form-5.pdf, the English-language Minor Release of Information Form (also Form 116, revised 03/21/2023 — three days earlier).

This is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) form in the traditional sense. It is a **standing access-designation form** that allows a parent or guardian to specify which individuals are authorized to access a minor's medical information on an ongoing basis. It does not request transfer of records to an outside entity; instead, it governs who the practice may share information with (appointments, billing, test results) and who may accompany the child to visits.

Within ACP's seven-document form ecosystem:

- **form-1** is the primary general-purpose ROI authorization.
- **form-2** is a practice-specific variant of form-1.
- **form-3** is the adult equivalent of this access-designation form.
- **form-4** is an imaging-specific release.
- **form-5** is the English original of this document.
- **form-7** is a HIPAA amendment request.

Form-6 is the **only Spanish-language document** among the seven forms retrieved. No Spanish version of the primary ROI form (form-1) was found.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was located on ACP's **Patient Forms page** at `azacp.com/forms/`, linked from the main website navigation. The source URL (`azacp.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/forms/Minor-Release-of-Information-Form-116-Spanish.pdf`) clearly identifies it as the Spanish version via the filename suffix "-Spanish." Per the retrieval notes, both general web searches and site-specific searches returned direct PDF URLs without difficulty.

No login or portal access was required to download the form. However, the filename convention relies on the user recognizing the "-Spanish" suffix or finding it on the forms page — a Spanish-speaking parent searching in Spanish (e.g., "formulario de divulgación de información médica") might not find this form through a search engine, since the page and URL are in English.

The form itself contains **no submission instructions** — no mailing address, fax number, email, or phone number for returning the completed form. A parent downloading this document has no guidance on how or where to submit it.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size**: 148 KB — lightweight.
- **Page count**: 1 page — concise, fits on a single sheet.
- **Text layer**: Present. Spanish text is selectable and searchable, which supports assistive technologies and copy/paste.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. Like all other ACP forms, this is a flat PDF with blank-line placeholders (e.g., `Nombre del paciente: _______________________________`), requiring printing and handwriting.
- **Fonts**: 3 fonts used.
- **Images**: 0 embedded images — no logo or graphics, unlike the English version's presentation.
- **Scan quality**: Native text, not an image-only scan.

The lack of fillable fields means this form cannot be completed digitally. For a Spanish-speaking parent population that may have varying access to printers, this is a barrier. There is no mention of an electronic alternative equivalent to the Swellbox wizard referenced in the notes (which is available only in English for general records requests).

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure and layout**: The form closely mirrors its English counterpart (form-5) in structure:
1. Patient identification (account number, name, DOB, date)
2. Introductory privacy statement
3. Authorized persons for records access (parents/guardians and other adults)
4. Appointment transport permission
5. Voicemail/message permission
6. "Do not release" exclusion section
7. Minor-seen-without-adult permissions (for patients 16+)
8. Signature block
9. Disclaimer note about informed consent for procedures

**Translation quality**: The form appears to be a competent, complete translation. Key phrases are rendered appropriately:
- "The confidentiality of our patient's medical information is very important to us" → "La confidencialidad de la información médica de nuestros pacientes es muy importante para nosotros"
- "DO NOT RELEASE Information to the following people" → "NO DIVULGUE INFORMACIÓN A LAS SIGUIENTES PERSONAS"
- The parenthetical about legal directives is preserved: "(SE DEBE PROPORCIONAR UNA DIRECTIVA LEGAL SI ES PADRE O GUARDIAN)"

**Minor differences from the English version**: The form-5 English version has two signature lines: "Parent Name" and "Parent Signature" on separate lines, with one date field. Form-6 has: "Firma del padre/ guardián" (signature) appearing twice with a date field for each, plus omits the separate printed-name line. This is a structural difference — the Spanish version collects two guardian signatures with dates, while the English version collects one printed name plus one signature.

**Field count**: The form includes approximately 18 blank fields: 1 account number, 1 patient name, 1 DOB, 1 date, 2 parent/guardian name+phone pairs (4 fields), 2 other adult name+phone pairs (4 fields), 2 transport permission entries (4 fields), 2 voicemail permission entries (4 fields), 2 "do not release" name fields, 2 initials lines, and 2 signature+date pairs.

**Readability**: The Spanish text is clear and straightforward. Sentences are not overly complex or legalistic. The note at the bottom explaining informed consent requirements is somewhat dense but faithfully translates the English original.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Purpose and audience**: This form serves a specific and practical need — allowing Spanish-speaking parents/guardians to designate who may access their child's medical information. In Tucson, AZ, where approximately 42% of the population is Hispanic, providing this form in Spanish is meaningful.

**Scope of coverage**: The Spanish translation covers only the minor access-designation form, not the primary ROI form (form-1), adult access designation (form-3), imaging release (form-4), or HIPAA amendment request (form-7). A Spanish-speaking parent who needs to request a full copy of their child's medical records would need to use the English-only form-1, which is a significant gap.

**No bilingual formatting**: The form is entirely in Spanish with no English annotations, parallel text, or bilingual headers. The only English text appears at the very bottom: "Form 116" and "Minor Release of Information" — these are form identifiers rather than patient-facing content. The footer label "Minor Release of Information" in English could confuse a monolingual Spanish speaker who wonders if the form title matches what they intend to sign.

**"Do not release" section**: The exclusion section is important for custody and safety situations. The form preserves the English version's requirement that a legal directive must be provided if excluding a parent or guardian ("SE DEBE PROPORCIONAR UNA DIRECTIVA LEGAL SI ES PADRE O GUARDIAN"). This is correctly included but could be intimidating for a parent in a difficult family situation — no guidance is provided on what constitutes a "directiva legal" or how to obtain one.

**Revocation**: The form states "puedo retirar los términos de este acuerdo mediante notificación por escrito" (I may withdraw the terms of this agreement upon written notice), but does not specify to whom or how to deliver that written notice.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**HIPAA considerations**: This form is a standing consent/access designation, not a HIPAA authorization for disclosure to a third party. It governs internal sharing practices (who can call about appointments, receive test results, etc.) and is more closely related to facility policies than to 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization requirements.

**No expiration date**: Unlike form-1's explicit one-year expiration, this form has no stated expiration. The parent can revoke via written notice, but absent revocation, the permissions appear to remain in effect indefinitely. The English version (form-5) is identical in this regard. While not necessarily a compliance issue, indefinite standing authorizations could become stale if family circumstances change.

**No notarization or witness requirements**: Only the parent/guardian signature and date are required — no notary, witness, or in-person submission is demanded.

**16+ minor seen alone**: The form includes initialing options for allowing minors 16+ to be seen without an adult and to receive minor procedures or immunizations unaccompanied. The bottom note appropriately clarifies that this general consent "no sustituye el consentimiento informado por escrito por separado" (does not substitute for separate written informed consent) for procedures — a meaningful liability and compliance protection.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish-language availability**: ACP is one of the few organizations likely to offer any form in Spanish. Providing this for a minor access-designation form in a heavily Hispanic community (Tucson, AZ) demonstrates awareness of language access needs. This is a meaningful, patient-centered decision.

- **Complete, faithful translation**: The form is not a truncated or simplified version of the English original — it preserves the full structure including the "do not release" section, the 16+ minor permissions, and the informed consent disclaimer note.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **English footer on a Spanish form**: The footer reads "Minor Release of Information" in English despite the entire form body being in Spanish. A monolingual Spanish speaker may not understand this label or may question whether they have the correct form.

- **Revocation instructions are vague**: "Puedo retirar los términos de este acuerdo mediante notificación por escrito" provides no guidance on whom to notify or how to deliver the written notice.

- **"Directiva legal" undefined**: The "do not release" section requires a legal directive to exclude a parent or guardian but does not explain what qualifies as a "directiva legal" or where to obtain one.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Structural discrepancy with English version**: Form-5 (English) has separate "Parent Name" and "Parent Signature" lines with one date field. Form-6 (Spanish) has two "Firma del padre/ guardián" lines each with their own date field, omitting the printed-name line. This means the Spanish form collects two signatures but no printed name, while the English form collects one printed name and one signature. These should be consistent.

- **Revision date discrepancy**: Form-5 is dated "Revised 03/21/2023" while form-6 is dated "Revised 03/24/2023" — a 3-day difference. While minor, this suggests the forms may not have been updated in lockstep, introducing risk that future updates to one may not be reflected in the other.

- **No submission instructions**: As with the English version, there is no address, fax number, email, or other guidance on how to return the completed form.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No Spanish version of the primary ROI form**: While offering this minor access-designation form in Spanish is positive, the absence of a Spanish-language version of form-1 (the actual records release authorization) means Spanish-speaking patients cannot request their own medical records — or their child's records for transfer to another provider — in their primary language. For a patient right as fundamental as records access, this is a meaningful gap that could constitute a barrier under HHS language access guidance.
