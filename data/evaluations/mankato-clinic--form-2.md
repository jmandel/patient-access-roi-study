# Evaluation: Mankato Clinic — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an **older version** of Mankato Clinic's "Authorization to Release and Disclose Patient Information" form, identified as **MC032 (07/20)** (July 2020). The organization also has a newer version of the same form, form-1.pdf, marked MC032 (02/23) (February 2023). Both share the same form number (MC032) and the same basic structure, confirming this is a superseded version that remains publicly accessible at its original URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/release_of_information_authorization_mc032-3.pdf`).

This is a **general-purpose HIPAA authorization form** for releasing patient information to or from third parties. It is not specific to patient self-access under HIPAA's Right of Access (§ 164.524); rather, it uses a bidirectional structure where the patient designates both a source ("Health Care Facility / Provider — WHO HAS INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE RELEASED?") and a destination ("Requestor — TO WHOM SHOULD THE INFORMATION BE RELEASED?"). The form could be used by a patient requesting their own records, but it is equally designed for provider-to-provider transfers and third-party disclosures.

The 2-page PDF consists of the form itself on page 1 and a full page of "AUTHORIZATION INSTRUCTIONS" on page 2.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was **easy to find**. Web searches for `Mankato Clinic "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` immediately returned direct PDF links. The form is linked from a dedicated Release of Information page at `https://www.mankatoclinic.com/resources/release-of-information/`. No login walls, bot blocking, or JavaScript rendering barriers were encountered.

However, the continued availability of this superseded 2020 version alongside the current 2023 version creates a risk of patient confusion. Both are accessible via direct URL, and a patient arriving via search engine could land on either version. The URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/...`) includes a date stamp suggesting it was uploaded in August 2021, but this is not immediately apparent to a typical user. There is no "this form has been updated" notice or redirect.

The filename `release_of_information_authorization_mc032-3.pdf` is descriptive and includes the form number, which is good practice.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (5,870 characters). This is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **Zero** interactive form fields (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being a digitally-created PDF (not a scan), the form relies entirely on printed blank lines (e.g., `Name:_____________________________________`) that must be printed and hand-filled or awkwardly typed over.
- **Page count**: 2 pages (form + instructions)
- **File size**: 366,420 bytes (~358 KB) for 2 pages with 2 embedded images. This is somewhat large for a simple form, suggesting embedded logo images may not be optimized.
- **PDF version**: 1.5
- **Font count**: 8 fonts used
- **Digital-first design**: No. While the PDF has a text layer and was clearly created digitally (not scanned), the lack of any fillable fields means patients must print, fill by hand, and return via fax or in-person. This is a print-first design published as a PDF.

The notes mention that Mankato Clinic also offers an online medical record request tool and accepts DocuSign, but this form itself provides no electronic fill-and-submit capability.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure and organization**: The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: Patient identification → Source of records → Destination for records → Information to be disclosed → Reason for release → Legal/revocation language → Signature. The second page provides clear section-by-section instructions. This is well-organized.

**Section labels**: This older version uses more formal, less patient-friendly labels compared to form-1. Where form-1 says "Release my medical records from" and "Share my medical records with," this version uses "Health Care Facility / Provider" and "Requestor" — terms that are less intuitive for patients.

**Contact information**: The header provides contact details for three ROI locations (Main, Wick/CHC, North) with separate phone and fax numbers for each, plus an email address (ROI@mankato-clinic.com). This is helpful but slightly cluttered.

**Checkbox options for record types**: The form offers 11 checkbox options for record types: Past 2 years of records, Clinic/Hospital records, X-ray reports, X-Ray film/CD/other, Lab/Pathology Reports, Immunizations, HIV/AIDS records, Financial/Billing, Mental health notes, Last colonoscopy/mammogram/Pap/eye exam, and Communication (Verbal/Written). This gives reasonable specificity.

**Reason options**: Five pre-set reasons (Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Medical Care, Transferring care) plus "Other" and a unique "No records needed at this time; keep on file" option.

**Instruction page**: Page 2 provides field-by-field guidance, which is genuinely helpful. It includes practical details like "We prioritize requests by appointment date" and "Please expect at least 7-10 business days from receipt of your request for processing."

**Language clarity**: The legal/revocation section is reasonably clear, though it uses longer sentences that could be simplified. The statement "I understand that Mankato Clinic will not condition my treatment on whether I sign this authorization form" properly addresses unconditional treatment, with appropriate exceptions noted for research and fitness-for-work exams.

**Layout**: The form is moderately dense on page 1 but not cramped. Visual hierarchy is maintained through bold section headers and boxed groupings.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: This form does **not** differentiate between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party authorization. The bidirectional source/destination model means a patient requesting their own records would need to list themselves as the "Requestor," which is workable but not intuitive. There is no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access, patient rights language, or any indication that patients have a legal right to their records.

**Scope control**: Patients can specify diagnosis/treatment and date ranges via a free-text field ("Records concerning: ___ Specific Diagnosis or Treatment and Specific Dates of Service") and can select specific record types via checkboxes. This provides adequate scope control.

**Delivery format options**: The form offers "COPIES: GIVEN / MAILED / FAXED ON: ___ / CALL WHEN READY / PICK UP" — but no electronic delivery option (no email, no portal, no download). The instructions page explicitly states: "Medical records are not able to be emailed." This limits patients to physical pickup, mail, or fax.

**Turnaround time**: The instructions state "at least 7-10 business days," which is within the HIPAA 30-day requirement but not particularly fast.

**Fees**: The authorization section states "I understand there may be a charge associated with the Release of Information services rendered" — but does not disclose what those charges are. Under HIPAA's Right of Access, fees for patient-access requests are limited to a reasonable, cost-based fee, but patients reading this form have no idea what to expect.

**Communication option**: The form includes a "Communication (check one / both) Verbal / Written" option, which appears to allow patients to authorize another person to receive verbal or written communication about their records. This is a useful feature.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration**: "This authorization will be in effect for 12 months from the date signed unless cancelled by me in writing." A 12-month expiration is standard and reasonable.

**Treatment conditioning**: The form correctly states treatment will not be conditioned on signing, with appropriate exceptions.

**Re-disclosure warning**: "I understand that once information is released pursuant to this authorization, Mankato Clinic cannot prevent the re-disclosure of the information to another third party." This is a standard and accurate HIPAA disclosure.

**Witness requirement**: The form includes a "Witnessed by:" line. While not labeled as mandatory, the presence of a witness line on an ROI form is unusual and could be perceived as an additional barrier. HIPAA does not require witnessed authorization for patient access requests.

**No re-release policy**: The instructions state "Mankato Clinic does not re-release medical records from other facilities." This is a policy disclosure, not a HIPAA barrier, but it's relevant for patients who received care across multiple facilities.

**Photo ID for pickup**: "Please bring a photo ID with you in order to pick up medical records." This is a reasonable identity verification measure.

**Legal representative documentation**: "Spouses or parents of children 18 and older are not able to sign for patient unless they are a legal representative of the patient and can provide appropriate documentation." This is accurate and appropriately protective.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No email delivery explicitly prohibited**: The instructions page states "Medical records are not able to be emailed," which may conflict with HIPAA's requirement (45 CFR § 164.524(c)(2)(ii)) that patients can request records in electronic form if the records are maintained electronically.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Witness line**: The form includes "Witnessed by: ___________________________________________" without clarifying whether a witness is required or optional. If required, this creates an unnecessary barrier not mandated by HIPAA. If optional, the blank line's presence may deter patients who lack a convenient witness.
- **Fee disclosure**: "I understand there may be a charge associated with the Release of Information services rendered" gives no indication of amounts, fee schedules, or whether patient-access requests are subject to HIPAA's cost-based fee limitation versus third-party release fee schedules.
- **Superseded version still accessible**: This July 2020 form remains publicly available alongside the February 2023 version (form-1). There is no indication on either the form itself or the hosting page that this is an older version, risking patient confusion about which form to use.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Inconsistent contact info**: The notes.md reports ROI contact as "Phone 507-385-4037, Fax 507-388-1878, Email ROI@mankatoclinic.com" (no hyphen in email domain), while the form itself shows "ROI@mankato-clinic.com" (with hyphen). This discrepancy could cause failed email delivery if patients use the wrong address.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Dedicated instruction page**: The full second page of field-by-field instructions is unusually thorough. Guidance like "Please be as specific as possible so that we can correctly identify which facility has your medical records" and "We prioritize requests by appointment date" is practical and patient-friendly.
- **"Keep on file" option**: The "No records needed at this time; keep on file" checkbox under Reason for Release is an unusual and thoughtful option for patients who want to pre-authorize future releases.
- **Multiple submission channels**: The form provides three separate ROI office contacts (Main, Wick/CHC, North) with dedicated phone and fax numbers, plus an email address, giving patients multiple points of contact.
- **Accepts any HIPAA-compliant form**: The instructions note "Any HIPAA compliant authorization form can be used," which is accurate and unusually transparent — most organizations only reference their own form.
