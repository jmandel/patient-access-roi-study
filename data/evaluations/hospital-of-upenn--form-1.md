# Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania — Form 1 Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is Penn Medicine's system-wide **"Authorization for Disclosure of Health Information"** (form ID UPHS-099-9, revision AEL 12/2020). It is a 2-page PDF covering all Penn Medicine locations — HUP, Penn Presbyterian, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Health, Penn Medicine Princeton Health, CPUP/CCA outpatient practices, and Penn Medicine at Home. The form is titled and structured as a general authorization for disclosure of protected health information (PHI), not a patient-access-specific request form.

A second form (form-2.pdf, UPHS-099-8, revision AEL 10/2018) was also found — an older version of the same authorization, hosted on a third-party neurology practice website. Form-1 is the current, official version: it is labeled as ADA-accessible, hosted on Penn Medicine's own infrastructure (med.upenn.edu and Sitecore content hub), and lists more current facility names (e.g., "Penn Medicine at Home" vs. the older "Penn Home Care & Hospice"). Form-1 also has 70 fillable fields while form-2 has none.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Moderate difficulty.** The form was located through multiple paths:

- A web search for `Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` returned the form from the UPenn medical school site (med.upenn.edu/ctsa/assets/).
- Penn Medicine's official patient access page (pennmedicine.org/patient-resources/policies/patient-access-health-information) links to an identical copy, but that page was initially blocked by **Incapsula bot protection**, which would prevent automated or programmatic access.
- The form URL (`https://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/assets/user-content/Authorization%20for%20Disclosure%20of%20Health%20Information_ADA.pdf`) uses a descriptive filename including "ADA" to signal accessibility, which is helpful.

However, the form is not immediately discoverable from the Penn Medicine homepage. A patient would need to navigate to Patient Resources → Patient Access Health Information, or know to search specifically for authorization/release forms. The website primarily directs patients who want their own records to the myPennMedicine patient portal, making the paper/PDF authorization somewhat secondary.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Strong digital artifact.** Key technical characteristics:

- **Text layer**: Full extractable text (9,255 characters across 2 pages). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: 70 interactive form fields — a very high count indicating comprehensive digital fill capability. This covers patient demographics, facility checkboxes, record type checkboxes, date ranges, behavioral health/SUD yes/no options, delivery method, and signature fields.
- **File size**: 175,352 bytes (171 KB) — compact and proportionate for a 2-page form with fillable fields and 13 fonts.
- **Fonts**: 13 embedded fonts, indicating designed typography rather than a flat scan.
- **Images**: 1 embedded image (likely a logo or label area graphic).
- **ADA designation**: The filename explicitly includes "_ADA," suggesting intentional accessibility design.
- **PDF structure**: Digital-first design with proper text encoding and interactive fields.

The form is clearly designed as a digital document, not a scan of a paper form. The 70 fillable fields represent comprehensive coverage — a patient could complete this entirely on-screen before printing or submitting.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Well-organized, moderately dense.** Page 1 contains the authorization itself; Page 2 contains detailed instructions and submission addresses.

**Page 1 layout:**
- Begins with a "Label Area" placeholder (for institutional use), then the title "AUTHORIZATION FOR DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION" in prominent text.
- Patient demographics section: name, DOB, address, city/state/zip, telephone number.
- Facility selection: 8 checkboxes for Penn Medicine locations plus "All Penn Medicine Locations" and an "Other" write-in.
- Release-to section: Name/entity, fax, address, city, state, zip.
- Date range: "Covering the period(s) of care" with date fields.
- Record types: 14 checkboxes (Discharge Summary, Operative Report, Lab Reports, Discharge Instructions, ER Record, EKG/ECG/Cardiac Tests, Radiology Reports, Radiology Images, History and Physical, Clinic/Progress Notes, Itemized Billing Record, Consultations, Medication Records, Abstract) plus an "Other Instructions" write-in.
- Behavioral health and SUD sections: Separate yes/no checkboxes with individual authorization requirements.
- Purpose of request: 4 checkboxes (Legal, Insurance, Personal, Continuation of Care) plus "Other."
- Delivery method: US Mail, CD, Email with security warnings.
- Authorization/signature block: Patient signature, personal representative, hospital representative, second witness.

**Language quality:** The form uses a mix of accessible and legal language. The core instruction "I am requesting my protected health information (PHI) from" is clear. The behavioral health/SUD disclosure paragraph is notably well-written: "I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party." However, the authorization section uses denser legal language about redisclosure risks and revocation.

**Page 2 (instructions):** Contains 6 numbered items covering who can sign (minors, emancipated minors, deceased patients, incompetent patients), submission addresses for 6 Penn Medicine hospitals, and 6 "Please note" items about fees, fax limitations, response timelines, denial rights, and third-party records.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Mixed — serves both patient access and third-party release, but not optimized for either.**

- **Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form is a general-purpose authorization. It includes "I request my PHI to be released to: Name of Person/Entity" — requiring a patient requesting their own records to fill in their own name as the recipient. This is workable but not intuitive. Per the retrieval notes, Penn Medicine directs patients wanting their own records to the myPennMedicine patient portal instead.
- **Scope options**: Granular. Patients can select from 14 specific record types, specify date ranges, and choose specific Penn Medicine facilities. The behavioral health and SUD sections provide explicit opt-in/opt-out, which is both legally required and patient-respectful.
- **Format/delivery options**: Three delivery methods offered — US Mail (paper), CD, and Email. The form warns: "CD/discs of images are not encrypted and may be accessible to others. Email generally is not secure and often is misdirected." This is transparent about risks but does not mention any secure electronic delivery option or patient portal integration.
- **Right of Access language**: The form does not explicitly cite HIPAA § 164.524 or use the phrase "Right of Access." However, the instructions on page 2 reference HIPAA-aligned timelines (30 days on-site, 60 days off-site, 30-day extension) and the right to have denials reviewed by a licensed healthcare professional. The sentence about having records "released directly to me" also acknowledges patient self-access rights.
- **EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or TEFCA.
- **Purpose of request options**: Include "Personal," which effectively covers patient self-access, but the form doesn't distinguish patient-access requests from third-party releases in any meaningful way that would streamline the process.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Generally compliant with some notable provisions:**

- **Fees**: Page 2 states Penn Medicine "will charge for copying records in accordance with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware law, as applicable" and that "Radiology images and reports will be free of charge." No specific fee amounts are disclosed. This is vague — patients don't know what they'll be charged until after submitting.
- **Expiration**: Authorization expires 180 days (approximately 6 months) after signing. This is reasonable and within common ranges.
- **Revocation**: Patients can revoke "at any time" but "must do so in writing." Standard provision.
- **No notarization required.**
- **No in-person submission required** — mailing addresses are provided for each hospital, and the form doesn't mandate in-person delivery.
- **Treatment not conditioned on signing**: "My refusal to sign this authorization will not affect my ability to receive treatment." This is the standard HIPAA-required statement.
- **Denial rights**: Page 2 explains that Penn Medicine may deny requests "under limited circumstances as provided for under federal law" and provides the Chief Privacy Officer's contact information for requesting review. This aligns with HIPAA requirements.
- **Redisclosure warning**: Standard language about information potentially losing protection upon redisclosure.
- **Response timeline**: 30 days for on-site records, 60 days for off-site, with a 30-day extension — aligns with HIPAA's 45 CFR § 164.524(b)(2) requirements.
- **Fax restriction**: "Penn Medicine will not send medical information by facsimile unless the information is needed for patient care and delay in the transmission of the information would compromise patient care." This limits a delivery option but is reasonable from a security standpoint.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **70 fillable fields** — one of the most thoroughly digitized forms one could encounter. A patient can complete the entire form on-screen without printing.
- **ADA-accessible designation** in the filename and likely in the PDF structure, indicating intentional accessibility effort.
- **Explicit patient self-access language**: "I can choose and have the right to have my records released directly to me so that I can review and inspect the materials, including for sensitive information I do not wish to be disclosed to a third party." This is unusually clear about patient self-access rights within a general disclosure form.
- **Granular record-type selection** with 14 checkboxes plus a write-in, giving patients fine-grained control over what is released.
- **Separate behavioral health and SUD opt-in** with dedicated yes/no checkboxes, properly respecting 42 CFR Part 2 and state mental health confidentiality requirements.
- **Free radiology images**: "Patient cost for Radiology images and reports will be free of charge."

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Fee structure is vague**: "Penn Medicine will charge for copying records in accordance with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware law, as applicable" gives no indication of actual costs. A patient cannot estimate what they will pay before submitting the form.
- **"Label Area" placeholder** at the top of both pages is unexplained — presumably for an institutional label or patient sticker, but this is not clarified and may confuse patients completing the form at home.
- **Ambulatory/office visit carve-out**: "Any Ambulatory/Office Visit requests should be addressed to the individual Physician's Office." This means a patient who checks "Clinic/Progress Notes" on the form and mails it to a hospital address may not receive their outpatient records, but this limitation is buried in the instructions on page 2.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No secure electronic delivery option**: Email is offered but explicitly flagged as insecure. No patient portal delivery, no secure file transfer, and no mention of electronic access beyond unencrypted email. For a major academic medical center in 2020 (form revision date), this is a significant gap — especially since Penn Medicine has a patient portal (myPennMedicine) that could serve as a secure delivery channel.
