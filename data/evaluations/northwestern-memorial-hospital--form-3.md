# Evaluation: Northwestern Memorial Hospital — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is the **Spanish-language version** of Northwestern Medicine's primary Release of Information form, titled "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA DIVULGAR INFORMACIÓN." It is a direct translation of form-1.pdf (the English "Authorization for Release of Medical Information"). The form number is **8094SP** (revised 8/2024), where the "SP" suffix indicates Spanish. The English counterpart is form 8094 (revised 2/2026).

The organization also provides:
- **form-1.pdf**: English-language ROI form (8094, rev. 2/2026) — the primary patient-facing authorization
- **form-2.pdf**: An inbound records request form ("Authorization to Disclose Health Information TO Northwestern Memorial Healthcare," form 6276, rev. 2/2022) — used to pull records from other providers into NMHC

Form-3 serves the same function as form-1: authorizing NMHC to release the patient's medical information to a designated recipient. It covers all NMHC system entities (11 hospitals, physician groups, behavioral health locations). It is a system-wide form, not specific to Northwestern Memorial Hospital alone.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, this form was straightforward to find. The source URL (`https://www.nm.org/-/media/northwestern/resources/patients-and-visitors/northwestern-medicine-authorization-of-release-of-information-spanish.pdf`) is descriptive and clearly identifies the document as the Spanish ROI form. The URL resides on nm.org's media CDN under a logical path (`/patients-and-visitors/`). Standard web searches for "Northwestern Medicine medical records release form" returned direct links. The filename includes "spanish," making it identifiable even before download.

However, because this is a Spanish-language form, its discoverability depends on whether a Spanish-speaking patient would find it through nm.org's patient resources pages. The URL itself is in English, which may limit discoverability for monolingual Spanish speakers searching in Spanish. Without navigating the site in Spanish, it's unclear how prominently this form is linked.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The full text is extractable (7,831 characters across 2 pages), confirming this is a digitally-authored PDF, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: **82 interactive form fields**, slightly more than the English version's 79 fields. This indicates the form is fully fillable — patients can complete it digitally without printing.
- **File size**: 160,333 bytes (156 KB) for 2 pages — reasonable and lightweight.
- **Fonts**: 17 fonts embedded (nearly double the English version's 9), likely due to the need for additional character support or different font variants for Spanish diacritics.
- **Images**: 0 embedded images.
- **Digital-first design**: Yes. The form was clearly created as a digital document with interactive fields, not scanned from paper.

The form is technically well-constructed. The high fillable field count (82) means patients can fill checkboxes, text fields, dates, and signatures digitally. This is a strong showing for technical accessibility.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 2 pages — proportionate to the content needed. Page 1 covers patient information, entity selection, purpose of release, record type selection, and delivery method. Page 2 covers medical images, recipient information, sensitive-information opt-outs, legal disclosures, and signatures.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow that mirrors the English version:
1. Patient Information (INFORMACIÓN DEL PACIENTE)
2. Entity Selection (FORMULARIO DE DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN)
3. Purpose (OBJETIVO DE LA DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN)
4. Medical Records Selection (REGISTROS MÉDICOS QUE SE DIVULGARÁN)
5. Medical Images (IMÁGENES MÉDICAS QUE SE DIVULGARÁN)
6. Recipient (ENVIAR INFORMACIÓN A)
7. Sensitive Information Opt-Outs
8. Legal Disclosures
9. Signatures

**Clarity of translation**: The Spanish text is competent and readable. Medical terminology is translated with parenthetical English acronyms where needed (e.g., "síndrome de inmunodeficiencia adquirida (AIDS, por sus siglas en inglés)," "Código de Reglamentos Federales (CFR, por sus siglas en inglés)"). The legal disclosures are dense but this is inherent to the content, not a translation failure.

**One notable difference from the English version**: The Spanish form (8094SP) is dated **8/2024**, while the English version (8094) is dated **2/2026**. This means the Spanish version is approximately 18 months behind the English version. The English form lists "Catherine Gratz Griffin Lake Forest Hospital" while the Spanish form lists simply "Lake Forest Hospital," suggesting the Spanish form has not been updated to reflect a hospital renaming. The English version also has a slightly different 42 CFR Part 2 disclosure that reflects updated federal regulations regarding HIPAA re-disclosure of substance use disorder information — this updated language does not appear in the Spanish version.

**Layout concerns**: The extracted text includes sequences of Unicode fill characters (e.g., `������������`) which appear to represent fillable lines/fields. This is standard for fillable PDFs and not a defect per se, but it does make the text extraction somewhat noisy.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: Like the English counterpart, this form is a **general authorization for release** — it does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and authorizing release to a third party. The form asks the patient to specify a recipient ("Enviar mi información a:") and a purpose, with "Uso personal" (Personal Use) as one option. A patient requesting their own records would need to list themselves as the recipient and check "Uso personal."

**Scope options**: Robust. Patients can specify:
- Date ranges for records (with a default of the last 24 months if unspecified)
- Specific record types: ER visits, hospital stays, ambulatory surgery, clinic/office visits, test results (lab, radiology, other)
- Medical images by modality (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, mammography, cardiology)
- Specific clinics/physicians
- Sensitive information opt-outs (HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic testing, mental health/developmental disability)

**Delivery options**: Multiple methods offered:
- "NM MyChart" (patient portal)
- Fax
- Email (with field for address)
- US Mail (CD or paper)
- Medical images via CD by US mail

**Submission methods**: Three options provided:
1. Mail to Winfield, IL address
2. Fax: 312.926.3093
3. Email: releaseofinformation@nm.org

**Contact for questions**: "¿Tiene preguntas? Llame al 877.9RECORD • (877.973.2673)" — a dedicated toll-free number. Notably, the Spanish version **lacks the TTY: 711 reference** that appears in the English version, which is a gap in accessibility for deaf or hard-of-hearing Spanish-speaking patients.

**Language accessibility**: The existence of this Spanish-language form is itself a notable positive. Many healthcare organizations provide ROI forms in English only.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization expiration**: Valid for **six (6) months** from the date of signature — identical to the English version. This is a standard timeframe and not unreasonably short.

**Right to revoke**: Clearly stated: "Tengo derecho a cancelar esta autorización en cualquier momento. Mi cancelación debe hacerse por escrito." Patients are directed to call NMHC's HIM Department at 877.973.2673 for revocation information.

**No denial of care**: The form states care will not be denied for refusal to sign, with the standard exception for care provided solely to gather information for third-party release (e.g., pre-employment exams).

**Fees**: "Es posible que se apliquen tarifas estándar para la copia de registros de acuerdo con lo establecido en el Capítulo 735 de los Estatutos Compilados de Illinois (ILCS, por sus siglas en inglés) 5/8-2006." This references Illinois' statutory fee schedule. HIPAA limits fees for patient-access requests to a reasonable cost-based fee, but the form doesn't distinguish between patient-access fees and third-party release fees, which could lead patients to believe higher third-party fees apply to their personal-use request.

**30-day response window**: "Entiendo que NMHC tiene hasta 30 días para revisar y responder las solicitudes." This is consistent with HIPAA's 30-day requirement (with a possible 30-day extension).

**Minor consent**: Patients aged 12-17 must sign for certain sensitive categories (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, STIs, pregnancy, sexual assault, contraception). A witness is required for mental health/developmental disability and genetic counseling disclosures.

**Re-disclosure notice**: Appropriately warns that information may lose federal privacy protection once disclosed to the recipient, with exceptions under Illinois law for sensitive categories and 42 CFR Part 2.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Spanish-language availability**: Providing a fully translated, fillable Spanish-language ROI form is a meaningful accessibility measure that many healthcare organizations do not offer. The translation is competent and includes helpful parenthetical English acronyms for legal/medical terms.
- **82 fillable fields**: The Spanish form has the same high level of digital interactivity as the English version, meaning Spanish-speaking patients are not disadvantaged by having a non-fillable or degraded version.
- **Multiple submission channels including email**: Offering mail, fax, and email submission options (releaseofinformation@nm.org) provides low-barrier access.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Fee language doesn't distinguish patient access from third-party release**: The reference to 735 ILCS 5/8-2006 fee schedules may mislead patients requesting their own records into believing they face the (higher) third-party copying fees rather than HIPAA's cost-based patient-access fee. The form makes no mention of HIPAA's Right of Access or § 164.524.
- **"Uso personal" as purpose category**: A patient requesting their own records must select "Uso personal" and then also fill in a recipient — listing themselves. This workflow is not intuitive and may confuse patients who don't realize they need to be both the requester and the recipient.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Spanish form is 18 months behind the English version**: Form 8094SP is dated 8/2024 while form 8094 (English) is dated 2/2026. The hospital list differs (the English form uses the updated "Catherine Gratz Griffin Lake Forest Hospital" name while the Spanish still says "Lake Forest Hospital"). The English version contains updated 42 CFR Part 2 re-disclosure language reflecting regulatory changes that the Spanish version lacks. This means Spanish-speaking patients are working from a form that does not reflect the most current legal language or entity names.
- **Missing TTY: 711 accessibility reference**: The English version includes "TTY: 711" in the contact information footer; the Spanish version omits this, creating an accessibility gap for deaf or hard-of-hearing Spanish-speaking patients.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **No HIPAA Right of Access reference**: Neither this form nor its English counterpart references HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's Right of Access. The form is structured as a general authorization (which could be used for third-party release), without any language specifically acknowledging that patients have a legal right to obtain their own records. This is a systemic design choice — the organization does not differentiate between patient access requests and third-party authorizations.
