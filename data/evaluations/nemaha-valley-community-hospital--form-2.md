## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)**, not a Release of Information (ROI) authorization form. It is the standard patient-facing document required under 45 CFR § 164.520, explaining how the hospital uses and discloses protected health information and describing patient rights.

In relation to the other document found for this organization, form-1.pdf is the actual ROI authorization form ("Authorization for Release of Health Information"), while this document (form-2.pdf) provides the legal and regulatory backdrop. The NPP references the right to access records and describes the process at a high level, but it is not the form a patient would fill out to request records.

The retrieval notes indicate this document was downloaded because it "provides context for the ROI process" — it was found alongside the ROI form on the Resources page and in search results.

## 2. FINDABILITY

According to the retrieval notes, the NPP was available on the hospital's Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) and was also referenced in search results. The URL path (`/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-021626.pdf`) includes a descriptive filename with date stamp, making it identifiable even from a raw link.

The document itself directs patients to obtain copies: "A copy of this Notice is available to you at your request... You may also obtain a copy of the Notice at our web site, www.nemvch.com." This is appropriate for an NPP — hospitals are required to make these available. The findability of this specific document is adequate, though what matters more for the study is whether a patient looking for the *ROI form* would find it, which is evaluated under form-1.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Strengths:**
- Full text layer present with 34,468 characters of cleanly extractable text — no OCR issues
- 20 embedded fonts, suggesting a natively digital document (not a scan)
- Only 1 embedded image (likely the hospital logo)

**Weaknesses:**
- Zero fillable fields — though this is an informational document, not a form, so fillable fields are not expected
- 525 KB for a 12-page text document is somewhat large but not problematic
- The document is a straightforward PDF with readable text; no accessibility concerns noted from the metadata

This is a **digitally-authored document**, in stark contrast to form-1.pdf which is an image-only scan. The NPP demonstrates the hospital is capable of producing proper digital PDFs.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: At 12 pages, this is a typical length for an NPP. The document covers all required HIPAA categories comprehensively, including recently updated provisions around substance use disorder (42 C.F.R. Part 2) and electronic health information exchange.

**Clarity**: The document uses a mix of plain language and legal terminology. Sections like "Get an Electronic or Paper Copy of Your Medical Record" use accessible phrasing: "Ask us how to do this." Other sections are more dense, such as the SUD treatment section, which contains longer legalistic sentences. Overall, the language is reasonably clear for a compliance document.

**Organization**: The document follows a logical structure:
1. Introduction and contact information
2. Patient rights (access, correction, accounting, restrictions, confidential communications, breach notification, complaints)
3. Standard uses and disclosures (treatment, payment, operations)
4. Patient choices
5. Special protections (SUD, marketing)
6. Additional disclosures (research, law enforcement, etc.)
7. Hospital responsibilities
8. Nondiscrimination notice and language taglines

**Visual Hierarchy**: Section headings use bold, caps, and asterisks (*) to denote subsections. The structure is readable from the text extraction, suggesting reasonable formatting in the PDF. The contact information for the Privacy Officer is prominently placed near the top.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Right of Access Information**: The document explicitly describes the right to "inspect and obtain a paper or electronic copy of your medical record." It provides meaningful detail about the process:
- Requests should be made "in writing" to the Contact Person, but "alternative arrangements may be made for individuals unable to make a request in writing"
- Electronic format is available: "You may request that your information be provided in an electronic format and we will provide the information to you in the form and format you request, if it is readily producible"
- Third-party transmission is supported: "You may also direct us to transmit your health information in paper or electronic format to a third party"
- Timeline: "usually within 30 days of your request"
- Fees: "We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee"

**Contact Information**: The document names a specific Privacy Officer (Courtney Schmelzle) with direct phone number (785-336-0426) and email (cschmelzle@nemvch.org), which is helpful for patients.

**Health Information Exchange**: There is a dedicated section on electronic health information exchange (HIT/HIO), referencing KanHIT.org and giving patients options to permit or restrict access. This is a relatively uncommon level of transparency about HIE participation.

**Limitation**: While the NPP describes patient rights, it does not itself provide the mechanism to exercise those rights — a patient would still need to locate the separate ROI form (form-1.pdf), which is an image-only scan with no fillable fields.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee language**: "We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee" — this correctly uses HIPAA's standard without specifying potentially excessive amounts. No fee schedule is provided.

**Timeline**: States "usually within 30 days," which is consistent with HIPAA's 30-day requirement (with possible 30-day extension).

**Written request requirement**: States requests "must" be in writing but then softens this: "alternative arrangements may be made for individuals unable to make a request in writing." This is a compliant approach.

**Denial of access**: Acknowledges the right to deny access "in certain limited circumstances" and commits to written notification and review process, consistent with HIPAA.

**SUD protections**: Includes a section on 42 C.F.R. Part 2 substance use disorder protections, reflecting the 2024 regulatory updates aligning Part 2 with HIPAA. This is notably current.

**Nondiscrimination**: Includes a full Section 1557 nondiscrimination notice with multilingual taglines in 15+ languages.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Recently updated**: Effective date of February 16, 2026 — this is a current document reflecting recent regulatory changes, including the 42 C.F.R. Part 2 alignment with HIPAA.
- **Named Privacy Officer with full contact details**: "Courtney Schmelzle, Privacy Officer, 1600 Community Drive, Seneca, KS 66538, 785-336-0426, cschmelzle@nemvch.org" — a specific person patients can reach, not just a department.
- **Electronic format commitment**: Explicitly states patients can request records "in an electronic format" and that the hospital will provide them in the requested "form and format... if it is readily producible" — this tracks closely with HIPAA's requirements under the 2013 Omnibus Rule.
- **Health Information Exchange transparency**: The dedicated HIT/HIO section with patient opt-out instructions and a link to KanHIT.org is more detail than most small rural hospitals provide.
- **Multilingual nondiscrimination taglines**: Includes language assistance notices in approximately 15 languages with a toll-free number (1-888-528-6692).
- **Accommodation for non-written requests**: The phrase "alternative arrangements may be made for individuals unable to make a request in writing" shows sensitivity to accessibility needs.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **"Reasonable, cost-based fee"** is mentioned without any specifics. While this is legally compliant language, a patient reading this NPP has no way to estimate what records access will cost.
- **KanHIT.org references**: The NPP directs patients to http://www.KanHIT.org for HIO opt-out, but uses the HTTP (not HTTPS) protocol, and the viability of this URL is not verified. If KanHIT.org is no longer operational, this guidance would be misleading.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Typo**: "unsecured potable electronic devices" should likely read "unsecured **portable** electronic devices" — a minor but noticeable error in the section about risks of unencrypted communications.
