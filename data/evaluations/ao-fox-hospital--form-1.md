# A.O. Fox Hospital — form-1.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **system-wide "Authorization for Medical Record Release"** (form H-6653) used across the entire Bassett Healthcare Network. The header lists five facilities with checkboxes: A.O. Fox Hospital (Oneonta, NY), Bassett Medical Center (Cooperstown), Cobleskill Regional Hospital, Little Falls Hospital, and O'Connor Hospital (Delhi). It is not a form specific to A.O. Fox Hospital alone — it is the single shared ROI form for all Bassett facilities.

Only one form was found for A.O. Fox Hospital. No Fox-specific form exists; patients are directed to this network-level document. The form's revision history line — `H-6653 5/03;3/04;2/05;7/06;3/12;4/16;9/17;2/18;7/25` — indicates it has been revised multiple times since 2003, most recently in July 2025.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was **easy to find**, though not via A.O. Fox Hospital directly. Searching for "A.O. Fox Hospital authorization release form" yielded no direct results. Searching for the parent system — Bassett Healthcare Network — immediately surfaced a direct PDF link at `https://www.bassett.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/Authorization-for-Medical-Records-Release-eform-2025.pdf`. The URL is descriptive (includes "eform-2025") and hosted on the main Bassett website under `/sites/default/files/`, suggesting it is published through a CMS and linked from an accessible page.

A patient who knows A.O. Fox is part of Bassett would find this quickly; a patient searching only for "A.O. Fox Hospital medical records" might struggle initially. The retrieval notes indicate no broken links or access barriers were encountered.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

This is a **well-constructed digital-first PDF**:

- **Text layer**: Full extractable text (4,844 characters across 2 pages). Not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: 83 AcroForm fields — an unusually high count for a 2-page form, indicating thorough interactive coverage. Checkboxes, text fields, and date fields all appear to be fillable.
- **File size**: 240 KB for 2 pages — reasonable and not bloated.
- **PDF version**: 1.6, created with Acrobat PDFMaker.
- **Fonts**: 8 embedded fonts — adequate typographic variety without excess.
- **Images**: Zero embedded images — the form is entirely vector/text-based.

The form was clearly designed for digital completion. The 83 fillable fields across a 2-page form is notably thorough, covering all checkboxes, text inputs, and signature areas.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The form is **2 pages** with **10 numbered sections**, providing a clear logical structure:

1. Patient Information (name, address, DOB, email, phone)
2. Records To Be Sent To (with "Self, address listed above" checkbox option)
3. Authorization for Verbal Communication
4. Disclosure Format (7 delivery method options)
5. Records To Be Disclosed (13 record type categories plus date range)
6. Opt-out for sensitive information (4 categories)
7. Purpose of Request (5 options)
8. Expiration of Record Disclosure
9. Your Rights & Acknowledgements (5 bullet points)
10. Signature block with representative options

**Strengths**: The numbered sections provide clear hierarchy. The form covers a comprehensive range of options without becoming unwieldy. Section headings are in bold and easily scannable.

**Weaknesses**: The language in Section 9 (Rights & Acknowledgements) is dense and legalistic — particularly the HIV/AIDS redisclosure paragraph, which is a single 4-line sentence. There is a typo in Section 1: "Frist" instead of "First" in "Full Name – Last, Frist, MI". Section 8's heading contains a typo: "DISCLOUSRE" instead of "DISCLOSURE". The form revision code `(d:\forms\hosp\.ofm)` is an internal file path exposed to patients, which looks unpolished.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access awareness**: The form explicitly supports patient self-requests. Section 2 includes a "Self, address listed above" checkbox, and Section 7 includes "Patient Request" as a purpose option. This is a general-purpose ROI form, but it accommodates patient access without forcing patients through a third-party release workflow.

**Delivery format options**: Notably strong. Section 4 offers **seven delivery methods**: MyBassett Portal, USB, CD, Fax, Paper via US Mail, Paper Pick-up at two locations, and Email. The default is explicitly stated: "If left blank, information will be provided through MyBassett Portal." The portal-first default is a patient-friendly design choice.

**Scope options**: Section 5 provides 13 record-type checkboxes plus "Entire Medical Record" and "Other." Date range fields are included. Section 6 allows patients to **opt out** of disclosing sensitive categories (Alcohol/Drug, Psychiatric, HIV, Genetic Testing), rather than requiring opt-in — a patient-protective design.

**Electronic delivery**: Yes — portal delivery is the default, and email (with encrypted/unencrypted options) is also offered. The form clearly explains the risk of unencrypted email: "Unencrypted email poses privacy risks. Bassett is not responsible for unauthorized access."

**Right of Access language**: Section 9 states: "Signing this authorization is voluntary. Treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits may not be conditioned on whether I sign this authorization." This references the HIPAA principle from 45 CFR § 164.508(b)(4). However, the form does not explicitly cite 45 CFR § 164.524 (Right of Access) by number. There is no mention of EHI export or bulk data access.

**Sensitive information protections**: The form includes a notice about 42 CFR Part 2 (substance abuse treatment records) at the bottom: "42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of these records." It also references the NY State Division of Human Rights (1-888-392-3644) for HIV/AIDS discrimination complaints — a state-specific compliance detail.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: Section 8 allows the patient to set an expiration date/event; if left blank, "authorization for record disclosure will expire (1) year from the date signed." A 1-year default is reasonable and not overly restrictive.

**Date range default**: Section 5 notes "If left blank, information from the past (1) year will be provided." This limits the scope unless the patient actively specifies otherwise — a minor barrier for patients seeking older records who may not realize they need to fill in the date range.

**No notarization required**: The form requires only the patient's signature (or authorized representative), with no notarization, witness, or in-person submission requirement.

**No fee disclosure**: The form does not mention fees or costs for record copies. This is neither a barrier nor a transparency measure.

**Representative authorization**: Section 10 provides clear categories for non-patient signers (parent, legal guardian, next of kin/executor, POA for Health Care), which is a well-structured approach.

**Revocation rights**: Section 9 clearly states revocation rights and the limitation that revocation doesn't apply to information already released.

**Redisclosure warning**: Appropriately included for both general records ("may be redisclosed by the recipient and no longer protected") and sensitive records (42 CFR Part 2, HIV/AIDS — prohibited from redisclosure without additional authorization).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Portal-first default delivery**: "If left blank, information will be provided through MyBassett Portal" is a progressive, patient-friendly design choice that prioritizes electronic access. Few forms default to electronic delivery.
- **Seven delivery format options** including USB, CD, encrypted email, and two physical pick-up locations — unusually comprehensive range of choices.
- **83 fillable fields** across 2 pages — one of the most thoroughly digitized ROI forms, with virtually every input element made interactive.
- **Opt-out model for sensitive records**: Section 6 asks patients what they *don't* want disclosed, rather than requiring explicit opt-in for each sensitive category — a more patient-friendly approach that defaults toward completeness.
- **Unencrypted email risk acknowledgment**: Clear, specific language about email privacy risks with an explicit checkbox to accept risk — transparent and well-designed.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Date range default**: The statement "If left blank, information from the past (1) year will be provided" could mislead patients who assume they're requesting their full record. There is no prominent notice that leaving this blank limits the scope.
- **Section 3 (Verbal Communication)** is embedded in a medical records release form but serves a different purpose (authorizing phone discussions). Its relationship to the records release authorization is unclear — does signing the form also activate verbal communication authorization, or only if Section 3 is filled in?

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Typo in Section 1**: "Full Name – Last, **Frist**, MI" — "Frist" should be "First."
- **Typo in Section 8 heading**: "EXPIRATION OF RECORD **DISCLOUSRE**" — should be "DISCLOSURE."
- **Internal file path exposed**: The revision line includes `(d:\forms\hosp\.ofm)` and `(d:\forms\hosp\.doc)` — Windows file paths that are internal implementation details inappropriately visible to patients.
