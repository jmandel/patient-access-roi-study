# Evaluation: La Clínica de La Raza — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is a **Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)**, not a Release of Information form. It is titled "NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES" with the subtitle "THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED, AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION." It is identified as **FORM 8092**, with a revision date of **10/12** (October 2012), spanning 8 pages.

This is the **only document actually belonging to La Clínica de La Raza** among the three forms downloaded. Form-1 and form-2 were both retrieved from a different organization — La Clinica Health Centers in Medford, Oregon (laclinicahealth.org) — due to search engine confusion between the two similarly-named entities. La Clínica de La Raza does not appear to publish a standalone ROI or authorization form on its website. This NPP is the closest patient-facing privacy/records document available online, and it contains the organization's instructions for requesting records access.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The NPP was found on the organization's website at `https://laclinica.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LC_8092-Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-English.pdf`. According to the retrieval notes, it was located by navigating to the "Notice of Privacy Practices" section of the website. However, **no ROI form was found anywhere on the site** despite exhaustive searching — multiple web queries, URL guessing, Wayback Machine checks, and manual website navigation all failed to locate one.

The NPP URL path includes a WordPress uploads directory with a 2019/09 timestamp, suggesting it was uploaded in September 2019 despite the document itself dating to 2012. The filename (`LC_8092-Notice-of-Privacy-Practices-English.pdf`) is descriptive and uses the organization's internal form number.

Because no ROI form exists online, a patient seeking to request records must first locate and read this 8-page NPP to find the brief instructions buried within it (Section III). There is no dedicated "Medical Records" or "Request Your Records" page on the website. Retrieval difficulty is rated **Hard / No form found online** in the notes.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The document has extractable text (28,542 characters), confirming it is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. There are no interactive form fields — expected for an NPP, which is informational rather than a fillable form.
- **File size**: 238,544 bytes (~233 KB) for 8 pages, reasonable.
- **Fonts**: 5 fonts embedded.
- **Images**: 1 embedded image (likely the organization's logo).
- **OCR artifacts**: The extracted text contains significant artifacts from what appears to be a watermark or sidebar design element. Fragments such as `EW`, `O N`, `LY`, and `VI` appear scattered throughout the text, likely from the letters of "PREVIEW ONLY" or similar watermark text that was partially captured during text extraction. Bullet points render as the letter `c` throughout (e.g., "`c Information from members/patients`", "`c Hospital, medical, mental health...`"), suggesting the PDF uses a custom bullet symbol that does not map cleanly to standard text.
- **Digital design**: The document appears to have been created digitally (not a scan), but the layout artifacts and bullet-point encoding issues suggest it was generated from a desktop publishing tool without full attention to text-layer fidelity.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: At 8 pages, this is a full-length NPP. The document covers all standard HIPAA NPP requirements: what PHI is, patient rights, permitted uses/disclosures, complaint process, and effective date.

**Clarity**: The language is typical dense HIPAA legalese. Sentences are long and clause-heavy, e.g.: "In the case that we use or maintain an electronic health record with respect to protected health information of an individual, you (1) have a right to obtain a copy of such information in an electronic format." The document uses "we/us/our" for the organization and "you/your" for the patient, which is somewhat more approachable than pure legal language.

**Organization**: The document is structured in numbered sections (I through X), covering responsibilities, definitions, patient rights, organizational scope, permitted uses/disclosures, authorization requirements, notice changes, complaint process, effective date, and a thank-you. This is a logical progression. However, the patient's most actionable information — how to actually request records — is not in its own prominent section but is embedded within Section III's narrative text.

**Layout**: The two-column design (inferred from text flow and page numbering showing "PAGE 1/8") with 5 fonts suggests reasonable visual hierarchy, though the extracted-text artifacts make it difficult to fully assess. The document ends graciously with "X. THANK YOU — We thank you for entrusting your health care to us."

**Readability**: The text is accessible to a reader with high-school or college literacy, but the volume and density of HIPAA-mandated content makes it challenging. Key action items for patients are not visually distinguished from surrounding explanatory text.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Records access instructions**: The NPP tells patients they have a right to access, inspect, or obtain copies of their PHI. The actual process instruction is minimal: "To request access to your PHI, please write us at the contact address at the end of this notice or if you know the name of the provider or medical office where you received your care, please write to us at that address." The contact address given is:

> La Clínica de La Raza, Inc.  
> Attention: Privacy Officer  
> P.O. Box 22210, Oakland, CA 94623

There is **no mention of any downloadable form, no email address, and no online submission option**. The only mechanism described is writing a letter.

**Electronic format awareness**: The NPP does acknowledge the right to receive PHI in electronic format: "you (1) have a right to obtain a copy of such information in an electronic format. You may request that we send such a copy directly to an entity or person designated by you." This is a positive inclusion reflecting HITECH Act requirements, though no practical mechanism for requesting electronic copies is described.

**Fee disclosure**: The document states "We may charge you a fee for the copies, summary, or explanation" and separately notes that electronic copies may incur fees "not to exceed our labor costs in responding to your request." No specific fee schedule is provided.

**Scope options**: The NPP does not provide any way for patients to specify what records they want — no checkboxes for record types, no date-range fields. This is expected since it's an NPP, not a request form, but since no request form exists online, the patient is left without guidance on how to scope their request.

**Language availability**: The notes indicate the website offers NPP PDFs in English, Spanish, and Chinese, which is appropriate for the East Bay community this FQHC serves. Only the English version was downloaded.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No unreasonable barriers explicitly imposed**: The NPP does not demand notarization, in-person submission, or other HIPAA-impermissible requirements. However, the practical effect of requiring patients to "write us" at a P.O. Box with no form, no email, and no portal option is itself a significant access barrier — particularly for patients of an FQHC, who may face literacy, housing instability, or resource constraints that make mailed letter-writing difficult.

**Document age**: The NPP is effective as of **October 1, 2012** — over 13 years old at the time of this evaluation. It may not reflect regulatory changes since 2012, including the 2013 HIPAA Omnibus Rule modifications and the 2016 CURES Act information-blocking provisions. Some of the language about electronic health record accounting of disclosures (referencing provisions that were proposed but never finalized in their original form) may be inaccurate or misleading.

**Fee language**: Stating fees may apply for electronic copies "not to exceed our labor costs" is consistent with the HIPAA fee limitation for patient access requests (45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4)), though the language could be clearer.

**Authorization expiration**: Section VI discusses written authorization for uses not described in the NPP, and notes the right to revoke. There is no mention of automatic expiration, which is appropriate for an NPP context.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No ROI form published online.** La Clínica de La Raza is the only organization in this evaluation set where no release-of-information or records-request form was found on the public website. The sole instruction for requesting records is to write a letter to a P.O. Box. For an FQHC serving a predominantly low-income, multilingual community, this is a meaningful barrier to exercising HIPAA access rights.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Please write us" is the only instruction.** The NPP does not specify what information a records request letter should include (e.g., patient name, DOB, date range, specific records desired, preferred format). A patient reading this would not know how to construct a valid request.
- **Fee language is vague.** "We may charge you a fee" without specifying amounts or referencing a fee schedule leaves patients uncertain about costs.
- **Electronic accounting of disclosures language** references provisions about "the three years prior to the date on which the accounting is requested" for electronic health records — this mirrors proposed (but never finalized in this form) HITECH regulations and may confuse patients or staff about actual obligations.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Text extraction artifacts.** Bullet points throughout the document render as the letter "c" in extracted text, and fragments like `EW`, `O N`, `LY`, and `VI` are scattered across the text — likely remnants of a watermark or decorative element. This degrades the document's utility for screen readers, text search, and any automated processing.
- **Severely outdated.** The NPP's effective date is October 1, 2012, making it over 13 years old. The website URL referenced is `http://www.laclinica.org` (HTTP, not HTTPS), and the document has not been updated to reflect the 2013 HIPAA Omnibus Rule or subsequent regulatory changes.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Multilingual availability.** The NPP is published in English, Spanish, and Chinese, reflecting the linguistic diversity of the FQHC's patient population.
- **Electronic format right acknowledged.** The NPP explicitly states the right to receive PHI in electronic format and to direct it to a third party, which some organizations omit entirely.
- **Gracious tone.** The document ends with "We thank you for entrusting your health care to us," and uses accessible "we/you" language throughout rather than purely institutional voice.
