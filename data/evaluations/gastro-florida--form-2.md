# Evaluation: Gastro Florida — form-2.pdf

## DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is a **single-page HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)** summary, not a Release of Information or authorization form. It describes how Gastro Florida may use and disclose patient health information and enumerates patient rights, including the right to "get a copy of your paper or electronic medical record." It is effective June 1, 2020, and names Kory Thomas as the HIPAA Compliance Officer at (727) 347-0536.

**Relationship to other downloaded documents:** Gastro Florida has three downloaded documents, none of which are ROI/authorization forms:
- **form-1.pdf** (4 pages): New patient registration packet with an embedded "Authorization to Release Information" clause limited to third-party payors and providers — not a patient-initiated records request form.
- **form-2.pdf** (1 page, this document): Older NPP summary (effective 2020), naming Kory Thomas as HIPAA Compliance Officer.
- **form-3.pdf** (7 pages): Updated full NPP (effective 1/1/2026), naming Josh Frazier as Privacy Officer. This is a substantially more detailed replacement for form-2.

Form-2 appears to be a **superseded version** of the practice's privacy notice, replaced by the more comprehensive form-3.pdf. Gastro Florida does not publish a downloadable ROI form; medical records requests are handled entirely through a third-party Sharecare/HDS online portal.

## FINDABILITY

The document was found on Gastro Florida's Patient Forms page (https://gastrofl.com/patient-forms/) linked as "HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices." The source URL is `https://gastrofl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Privacy-Practices-Notice-Gastro-Florida.pdf`, indicating it was uploaded in October 2021.

From the retrieval notes, the dedicated Medical Records page (https://gastrofl.com/medical-records/) is completely empty — "only has the heading 'Medical Records' with no content, instructions, or downloadable forms." A patient looking for a way to request records would find no guidance there. The Patient Forms page links to a Sharecare portal for medical records requests but provides no downloadable authorization form. This NPP is easy to find on the Patient Forms page, but it does not serve the purpose a patient seeking to request records would need.

## TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Present. Full text is extractable (8,372 characters), confirming this is a digitally-created document, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. As an informational notice, no interactive fields are expected or needed.
- **File size:** 97,058 bytes (95 KB) for a single page — reasonable, though the 2 embedded images contribute to a slightly inflated size for a text-heavy document.
- **Fonts:** 5 fonts used, suggesting basic typographic formatting (likely headings, body text, and bullet styles).
- **Digital-first design:** Yes. The document was created digitally with a proper text layer. It is not a scan of a paper form.

The document functions adequately as a digital artifact for its intended purpose (informational notice).

## CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** One page containing approximately 8,372 characters of text. For a summary NPP, this is dense but within the expected range for a condensed overview.

**Clarity:** The language is largely plain and patient-friendly. Key rights are stated simply: "Get a copy of your paper or electronic medical record," "Correct your paper or electronic medical record," "Request confidential communication." The document uses bullet-pointed lists throughout, which aids scannability.

**Organization:** The document follows a standard NPP structure:
1. "Your Rights" — listed with bullet points
2. Expanded explanations of each right
3. "Your Choices" — opt-in/out scenarios
4. "Our Uses and Disclosures" — treatment, operations, billing, plus an electronic exchange list
5. Permitted/required disclosures
6. "Our Responsibilities"
7. Complaint process
8. Contact information

However, cramming all of this onto a single page creates an extremely dense layout. The "Your Choices" section appears twice with partially overlapping content — once in the left column area and again mid-page — suggesting a layout issue, likely from a two-column format that didn't linearize cleanly in text extraction.

**Electronic Exchange section** lists specific partner organizations by number (Lab Corp, Quest Diagnostic, Mid-Florida Pathology, Baycare eXchange, Palms of Pasadena Hospital, Ameripath, University of Florida, SPL), which is an unusual level of specificity for a privacy notice.

**Layout issues:** The numbered list in the electronic exchange section has awkward formatting, with items appearing out of visual order in the extracted text (e.g., "4) Baycare eXchange" and "7) University of Florida" appear on lines separated from their numerical neighbors), suggesting a multi-column layout.

## PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**This document is not an ROI form and cannot be used to request records.** As an NPP, it informs patients of their rights but provides no mechanism to exercise them.

The document does mention the right to access records: "You can ask to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and other health information we have about you. Ask us how to do this." However, the instruction is simply "Ask us how to do this" — no phone number, no URL, no form reference, and no mention of the Sharecare portal that Gastro Florida actually uses for records requests.

The NPP states: "We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information, usually within 30 days of your request. We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee." This language is consistent with HIPAA requirements.

**No submission pathway described:** The document does not tell patients how to initiate a records request. A patient reading this would know they have the right but not how to exercise it.

**Complaint process:** The document provides a complaint process: "please ask our staff for a Privacy Complaint Form" and gives the HHS OCR address, phone number, and URL. This is adequate.

## COMPLIANCE

As an informational notice rather than a request form, compliance concerns are limited. Notable observations:

- **Fee language:** "We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee" — consistent with HIPAA's permissible fee structure.
- **Timeline:** "usually within 30 days" — consistent with the 30-day HIPAA requirement (with possible 30-day extension).
- **Summary option:** "We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information" — under HIPAA, a summary may only be provided if the patient agrees to it. The phrasing here implies the practice can choose to provide a summary rather than a full copy, which could be misleading.
- **Retaliation:** "We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint" — appropriate inclusion.

## NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **"Copy or a summary":** The text states "We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information" without noting that providing a summary in lieu of a copy requires patient agreement. Under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(2)(iii), a summary may only be substituted if the individual agrees in advance. This phrasing could lead patients to believe the practice can unilaterally decide to provide a summary instead of the full record.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Ask us how to do this":** The NPP tells patients they can request records but provides no concrete instructions — no form, no portal link, no phone number specific to records requests. Given that Gastro Florida uses a third-party Sharecare portal for records requests, the absence of any reference to that portal is a significant gap.
- **Duplicate "Your Choices" sections:** The text contains two sections both titled "Your Choices" with partially overlapping content. This may be a layout artifact of a two-column design, but it creates confusion in the document's logical flow.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Superseded compliance officer:** This document names Kory Thomas as HIPAA Compliance Officer, while the updated 2026 NPP (form-3.pdf) names Josh Frazier as Privacy Officer. If this older NPP is still linked on the Patient Forms page alongside the newer version, patients could contact the wrong person.
- **Outdated document still published:** The 2020-effective NPP remains linked on the Patient Forms page despite the existence of an updated 2026 version (form-3.pdf). Having two versions simultaneously available creates confusion about which is authoritative.
- **Numbered list formatting:** The electronic exchange partner list (items 1-8) renders with items out of sequence in the text layer, suggesting a multi-column layout that doesn't linearize properly — e.g., items 4, 7 appear separated from their expected positions.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Plain language throughout:** The document consistently uses patient-friendly language ("Get a copy of your paper or electronic medical record" rather than legalistic alternatives). The rights section is particularly accessible.
- **Electronic exchange transparency:** Listing specific partner organizations (Lab Corp, Quest, Baycare, etc.) that receive electronic data is more transparent than most NPPs, which typically use vague language about "business associates."
