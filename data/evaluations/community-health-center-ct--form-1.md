# Evaluation: Community Health Center, Inc. — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information" form — a site-specific variant of CHC's standard ROI form (form-2.pdf). It is customized for the "B23 Site" (Birth to Three program), with pre-filled recipient information for "Rebecca Smith/ Birth to Three" at "450 Columbus Blvd Suite 205, Hartford CT 06103" and a pre-filled fax number (860-326-0559). The record-type checklist includes a site-specific entry: "B23 Site/Evaluations/Assesments/IFSPs" — unique to this variant. The expiration field is pre-filled with "Third Birthday," aligning with the Birth to Three early intervention program's age cutoff.

CHC has three ROI forms on file: this B23-specific variant (form-1), a standard English version (form-2, revised 6/2019), and a Spanish translation (form-3, revised 7/2019). This form shares the same underlying structure and legal language as form-2 but is tailored for a specific referral workflow. The form footer reads "1 of 1; 10/31/19," indicating a revision date of October 31, 2019.

## 2. FINDABILITY

According to retrieval notes, this form was found via its direct WordPress uploads URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Release-of-Information-for-B23.pdf`). It was not directly linked from CHC's patient forms page, which has transitioned to Luma Health online form portals. The filename ("Release-of-Information-for-B23.pdf") is reasonably descriptive — it indicates both the document type and its program-specific scope. However, a patient searching for a general medical records release form would not naturally discover this variant; it appears to be an internal/program-specific tool that happens to be publicly accessible. The URL path places it under a July 2024 upload directory, though the form content itself appears unchanged from October 2019.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present — 4,456 characters of extractable text. Not an image-only scan.

**Fillable fields**: Zero fillable (interactive) form fields despite being a digitally authored PDF. All blanks are represented as underscores in the text layer. This means the form cannot be completed digitally within a PDF viewer; it must be printed, filled by hand, and then faxed/mailed/delivered.

**File size**: 243,549 bytes for a single page — somewhat large relative to content, likely due to the 2 embedded images (probably a logo/header graphic) and 22 fonts.

**Font count**: 22 fonts is unusually high for a one-page form. The standard version (form-2) uses only 4 fonts. This suggests the B23 variant was created by overlaying text on top of the standard form (the pre-filled recipient info and custom checklist items) rather than editing the source document cleanly.

**Digital design**: The document was authored digitally (not a scan), but it is designed as a print-first form. The pre-filled text for the "OBTAIN" section appears jumbled in the extracted text — fields like "Hartford", "860", "326", "0559", "CT", "06103" appear on separate lines rather than flowing naturally, suggesting they were placed as individual text boxes positioned over the blank fields rather than integrated into the form structure.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page — appropriate for an authorization form. All content fits on a single page, which is commendable.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow: patient identification → direction of disclosure (release vs. obtain) → self-request option → record types → date range → reason → expiration → legal notices → signature. This is a sound structure.

**Clarity**: The language is mostly clear. The legal paragraph at the bottom is dense but covers required elements (right to revoke, voluntary nature, redisclosure warning). The sentence "I need not sign this form to ensure healthcare treatment" is a good plain-language inclusion.

**Layout concerns**: The pre-filled "OBTAIN" section creates visual confusion. In the extracted text, the recipient's name, address, city, state, zip, phone, and fax are scattered across multiple lines mixed with blank field markers. While this may render adequately in the PDF visually, the underlying text structure is messy, which would affect screen readers and text extraction.

**Record type options**: The form offers 9 checkbox categories including "Progress notes," "Consultation notes," "Complete health record (No telephone encounters)," "Complete health record (With telephone encounters)," "Dental records, including x-rays," "Labs," "Immunizations," "X-ray, CT Scan, MRI, US results," and the B23-specific "B23 Site/Evaluations/Assesments/IFSPs." There is also an "Other" free-text field.

**Spelling error**: "Assesments" is misspelled (should be "Assessments") in the B23-specific checklist item.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form serves dual purposes — both releasing records to a third party and obtaining records from a third party. It also includes a self-request option: "If releasing information to ME, my medical records should be released via: Mail / Fax / Pick Up / E-Mail." This is good — patients can use this form to request their own records.

**Delivery options**: Four delivery methods are offered for self-requests: mail, fax, pick-up, and email. The inclusion of email is a positive feature, providing a digital delivery channel.

**Scope control**: Patients can specify date ranges ("From the dates ___ to ___", "From start of care to present", "Last three (3) years"), specific record types via checkboxes, and can exclude specific drug/alcohol information. This gives patients meaningful control over what is disclosed.

**Sensitive information protections**: Drug/alcohol abuse, psychiatric/behavioral health, and HIV/AIDS information require separate, explicit consent checkboxes — consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 and state-level protections. The form also allows patients to specify exclusions for drug/alcohol information.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or use the phrase "Right of Access." It does state "I understand that I have a legal right to revoke this authorization at any time" and notes the authorization is voluntary.

**EHI/bulk export**: No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or bulk data access.

**Processing time**: The form states "CHC has 30 days to fulfill my request" — this is within the HIPAA-permitted timeframe (30 days, extendable to 60).

**Purpose**: However, as a program-specific form pre-configured for Birth to Three referrals, this document is not well-suited for a patient simply trying to access their own records. A patient would need to find form-2 (the generic version) or navigate to the Luma Health portal for general record requests.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: The form states "This authorization will expire 90 days from the date on which it was signed, unless I indicate a different expiration event or date below." The pre-filled value is "Third Birthday." For the Birth to Three context, this makes sense (the program serves children age 0-3), but 90 days as a default is relatively short compared to many organizations. This is not a compliance concern — shorter expirations protect patients — but patients need to be aware if they want a longer window.

**No unreasonable barriers**: The form does not require notarization, witnesses, or in-person submission. It provides a fax number (860-343-7379) and mailing address for submission.

**Fee disclosure**: No fees are mentioned on the form.

**Typo in legal text**: The form contains "in response to his authorization" — should read "this authorization." This same typo appears in form-2 as well, indicating it was inherited from the template.

**Bundling**: The form does not bundle records release with other authorizations. It is single-purpose.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
*(None identified)*

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- The form's program-specific pre-fills (Rebecca Smith/Birth to Three, Hartford address, "Third Birthday" expiration) may confuse patients who encounter this PDF expecting a general-purpose ROI form. It is unclear whether a patient should cross out the pre-filled information to use this form for a different purpose, or whether they should seek a different form entirely.
- The "OBTAIN" vs. "RELEASE" checkbox structure is somewhat ambiguous for patients unfamiliar with the distinction — a patient wanting their own records might not realize they need the "RELEASE...to ME" option rather than either of the first two checkboxes.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Spelling error**: "Assesments" in "B23 Site/Evaluations/Assesments/IFSPs" — missing an 's' (should be "Assessments").
- **Typo in legal text**: "the revocation will not apply to information that has already been released in response to **his** authorization" — should read "**this** authorization." This error is present in the template (form-2) as well.
- **Jumbled text extraction**: The pre-filled OBTAIN section fields render as disjointed text fragments ("Hartford", "4400", "860", "326", "500", "0559", "CT", "06103") due to text boxes overlaid on blank fields, suggesting the phone number 860-500-4400 and fax 860-326-0559 were placed as separate positioned elements. This would cause problems for screen readers and assistive technology.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Email delivery option**: Offering email as a delivery method for self-requests is forward-thinking and reduces barriers for digital-savvy patients.
- **Granular exclusion control**: The ability for patients to specify what drug/alcohol information to *exclude* (rather than just all-or-nothing consent) gives patients fine-grained control over sensitive disclosures.
- **Single-page design**: Fitting the complete authorization form on one page with all necessary legal language is efficient and patient-friendly.
