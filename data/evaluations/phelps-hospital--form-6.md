### 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-6 is **not an ROI form itself** but a companion instruction guide for form-2 (the "Request for Access to Health Information by Patient or Personal Representative" form). It is titled "Instructions For Completing The Request For Access To Health Information By The Patient Or Personal Representative" and is published by Northwell Health's Health Information Management department. The document walks through each section of the patient access form with step-by-step guidance and annotated sample data (e.g., "Jane Patient," date of birth "09/09/2000," address "321 Main St. Anywhere, NY").

Within the Phelps Hospital / Northwell Health document set, form-6 is the patient-access counterpart to form-4 (which provides instructions for the third-party Authorization for Release form). Northwell publishes a parallel structure: two core forms (form-1/form-3 for third-party release, form-2 for patient access) plus two instruction guides (form-4 for the release form, form-6 for the access form). This is a system-wide Northwell Health document, not Phelps Hospital–specific.

### 2. FINDABILITY

The instruction guide is linked directly from the Northwell Health medical records page (https://www.northwell.edu/manage-your-care/medical-records) alongside the corresponding form. According to the retrieval notes, the medical records page is well-organized with clear section headings distinguishing "Request for Access to Health Information" from "Authorization for Release of Health Information." The file URL (`request-for-access-to-health-form-instructions.pdf`) is descriptive and clearly identifies this as an instructions document. A patient navigating to Northwell's medical records page would find this document alongside the form it supports, reducing the risk of confusion over how to complete the form.

### 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

The document has a text layer (full_text_chars: 4,210) and is not an image-only scan. However, at 435 KB for a 2-page document, the file is relatively large — likely due to 9 embedded images (annotated screenshots of the form with sample entries). The document has 9 fonts. There are **zero fillable fields**, which is appropriate since this is an instruction document, not a form to be completed. The PDF is digitally created (not a scan) with cleanly extractable text; the text extraction is fully legible with no OCR artifacts.

The file size is somewhat bloated relative to content (form-4, the 3-page instructions for the release form, is 565 KB; form-2, the actual 2-page patient access form, is 656 KB), suggesting images may not be optimally compressed, though this is a minor concern for a supplementary document.

### 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The document is organized as a numbered list (steps 1 through 6) corresponding to the sections of the patient access form. Each step provides:

- A description of what information to enter
- Contextual guidance (e.g., "There should only be one patient listed on the form")
- Practical examples with sample data

**Clarity:** The language is generally plain and instructive. Sentences like "Enter the name, date of birth, address, and telephone number of the patient requesting records" are direct and action-oriented. The document avoids excessive legal jargon, though step 5 introduces complexity: "Complete this section ONLY IF the medical records you are requesting contain substance use disorder treatment information or HIV/AIDS Information."

**Helpful guidance on record types:** Step 4 provides useful practical advice distinguishing between doctor's office records and hospital records:
- "For a doctor's office, if you are unsure of the time frame, select Medical Record Abstract and the most recent information will be released."
- "For a hospital, A medical record abstract may consist of pertinent contents from the patient's most recent discharge..."

**Layout concerns:** The embedded images with annotated form sections provide visual context. The document uses a consistent header ("Instructions For Completing The Request For Access To Health Information By The Patient Or Personal Representative / Health Information Management") on each page. At 2 pages, the length is proportionate for an instruction guide.

**Minor formatting issues:** There's a capitalization inconsistency ("if you are unsure of the time frame" appears mid-sentence with lowercase "if" in the hospital bullet under step 4). The document version identifier "182699 v.1" appears in the footer alongside "Northwell Health – Request for Access to Health Information Management by the Patient or Personal Representative."

### 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This document is specifically focused on patient self-access, which is a strong positive signal. The title explicitly references "Patient Or Personal Representative," and the entire document assumes the reader is a patient filling out their own request. Key patient-friendly features:

- **Self-direction option:** Step 2 notes "If the records requested are for yourself, please write your complete name and address" — acknowledging patients may direct records to themselves.
- **Delivery method guidance:** Step 3 explains the delivery options (mail, electronic mail, fax) and notes "If this information is not included, records will be sent via regular mail," which sets clear default expectations.
- **Practical help with scope:** Step 4's distinction between doctor's office and hospital records, along with the explanation of what a "medical record abstract" contains, helps patients who may not know what to request.

However, the document does **not** reference HIPAA § 164.524 or patient rights — those references exist only in the form itself (form-2). There is no mention of electronic health information (EHI) export, timelines for fulfillment, fee information, or how to submit the completed form. Step 5 introduces the concept of substance use disorder and HIV/AIDS information requiring special handling, including expiration dates, but does not explain *why* these protections exist, which may confuse patients.

### 6. COMPLIANCE

As an instruction document rather than an authorization form, this document does not directly impose requirements or barriers. However, it conveys some implicit requirements worth noting:

- **Separate requests required:** Steps 1 and 2 both state that "If records are needed by more than one person/facility, a separate request is required." This is a procedural limitation, not necessarily unreasonable, but adds burden.
- **Expiration requirement for sensitive records:** Step 5 states "The expiration date, event, or condition upon which the form will expire must be a fixed period of time (e.g., 1 Year, 30 days post discharge)." This is consistent with 42 CFR Part 2 requirements for substance use disorder information.
- **No fee disclosure:** The instructions do not mention any fees associated with obtaining records, which is neither a barrier nor a transparency measure.

### 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

- ✨ **BRIGHT SPOTS:**
  - Northwell Health provides a dedicated instruction guide for their patient access form — a practice that goes beyond what most organizations offer. Having a separate, purpose-built instruction document with annotated visual examples demonstrates genuine investment in helping patients navigate the records request process.
  - The document's practical guidance on choosing between "Medical Record Abstract" and specific date ranges, with clear explanations of what each option includes for doctor's offices vs. hospitals, is unusually helpful.

- ⚠️ **AMBIGUITIES:**
  - Step 1 instructs the patient to "Enter the contact information or health care provider or entity to release this information," but the wording "release this information" is phrased from the perspective of the releasing party, which may confuse patients who are requesting access to their *own* records. The form-2 version phrases this as "Northwell Health Entity/Facility to Release this Information (From Who)," which is slightly clearer.
  - The document does not explain where or how to submit the completed form (mail, fax, in-person, email) — a significant practical gap for an instruction guide.

- ❌ **ERRORS:**
  - The footer text reads "Northwell Health – Request for Access to Health Information **Management** by the Patient or Personal Representative" — the word "Management" appears to be erroneously inserted, creating the odd phrase "Health Information Management by the Patient." The form itself (form-2) does not include "Management" in this position. This appears to be a copy-paste error from the department name "Health Information Management" in the document header.
