## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is **not a Release of Information (ROI) form**. It is a single-page "Patient Acknowledgment Form" for an allergy form completion fee. The document informs patients that a $25 fee applies when they ask the practice to fill out allergy-related forms (e.g., school or activity clearance forms) and requires the patient to sign acknowledging responsibility for that fee.

This organization has two downloaded forms. Form-1 is the actual ROI/HIPAA authorization ("AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PURSUANT TO HIPAA"). Form-2 (this document) was found in the website footer under the misleading label "Allergy Authorization Form," which could easily be confused with a records release authorization. It is tangentially related to records access in that it involves a fee for physician work on patient-related paperwork, but it is not a mechanism for patients to request their health information.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was found in the website footer labeled "Allergy Authorization Form" — a label that is misleading since the document is not an authorization form for releasing records but rather a fee acknowledgment. A patient searching for an ROI form could click this link expecting a records release authorization and be led astray. The URL (`Patient-Acknowledgment-Form_6.5.25_F.pdf`) is more descriptive of the actual content than the link text. The form was easier to find than the actual ROI form (form-1), which was only discoverable via web search of a hidden `.doc` URL — but its discoverability is irrelevant since it doesn't serve the ROI purpose.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Format:** Native PDF, 1 page, 144,217 bytes — reasonable size for a single-page document.
- **Text layer:** Yes, full text is extractable (1,342 characters). Not an image scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero. The form has four signature/print lines rendered as static underscores (`____________________________`), requiring the patient to print and fill by hand.
- **Fonts:** 6 fonts used, suggesting moderate formatting (bold headers, body text, bullet styling).
- **Embedded images:** 1 (likely a logo).
- **Digital-first design:** No — this is designed for print-and-sign. There are no interactive fields, no checkboxes, no digital signature capability. A patient would need to print, sign, and submit in person.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The document is concise and clearly written at approximately a 9th-grade reading level. The structure is straightforward:

1. A brief introductory paragraph explaining why the fee exists.
2. A "Form Completion Policy" section with four bullet points covering the fee amount, payment timing, turnaround time, and insurance non-coverage.
3. An "Acknowledgment" section with signature, printed name, DOB, and date fields.

The language is plain and accessible. Key terms are clearly stated: "$25 per form," "2 business days," "not covered by insurance." The layout uses adequate whitespace and a logical top-to-bottom flow. At 1,342 characters total, it is proportionate to its purpose — no unnecessary legalese or padding.

The four signature fields (Patient or Guardian Signature, Printed Name, Patient's Date of Birth, Date) are appropriate for the document's purpose.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This document is not designed to help patients access their health records. It serves a narrow administrative purpose: acknowledging a $25 fee for physician form completion. It does not reference HIPAA, patient rights, Right of Access, electronic delivery, or any mechanism for requesting medical records.

From a patient experience perspective, the form is straightforward about what it asks. The fee is disclosed clearly ("$25 per form"), the turnaround is stated ("2 business days"), and the insurance exclusion is explicit ("not covered by insurance and is the patient's responsibility"). However, these are service fees for form completion, not fees related to medical records access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

This document does not raise ROI-specific compliance concerns since it is not an ROI form. The $25 fee it describes is for physician time completing allergy-related forms (school/activity clearance), which is a separate service from medical records release. This fee is not subject to HIPAA's reasonable cost-based fee limitations for patient access requests (45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4)), since it covers physician clinical work rather than copying/releasing records.

The statement "Payment is due prior to or at the time of form submission" conditions form completion on upfront payment, which is standard for this type of ancillary service.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Misleading link label on website:** The notes indicate this PDF was found under the footer label "Allergy Authorization Form." The word "Authorization" could lead patients to believe this is an authorization for release of allergy-related health information, when it is actually a fee acknowledgment for form completion. This mislabeling could waste patient time or create confusion about whether this is a prerequisite for obtaining allergy records.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Not fillable despite being a native PDF:** The document has zero fillable fields despite being created digitally (not scanned). Adding four simple text fields and a signature field would be trivial and would allow patients to complete the form electronically.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Clear, plain-language fee disclosure:** The form states the fee, timing, and insurance exclusion in simple bullet points. The sentence "This fee is not covered by insurance and is the patient's responsibility" is a model of transparent fee communication — direct and unambiguous.
- **Reasonable turnaround commitment:** Promising completion "within 2 business days from the date of payment and submission of all necessary information" sets a concrete expectation, which many practices do not do.
