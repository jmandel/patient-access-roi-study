# Evaluation: UMC Southern Nevada — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Request for Amendment of Protected Health Information** form, version MRU01840 dated 02/10/22. It is a single-page PDF (118,189 bytes) that allows patients to request corrections or additions to their medical records under HIPAA's right to amend (45 CFR § 164.526). This is **not** a Release of Information (ROI) form — it serves a different HIPAA right entirely.

Three documents were found for this organization:
- **form-1.pdf**: The current PHI Release Authorization (MRU00695, 01/29/19) — the primary ROI form
- **form-2.pdf**: An older version of the same PHI Release Authorization (MRU00695, 06/06/16)
- **form-3.pdf** (this document): Request for Amendment of PHI — a separate document type

This form was included in the retrieval because it was the only form prominently linked from the Medical Records page. It is part of the broader patient records workflow but does not serve the purpose of requesting copies of records.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Ironically, this is the most findable of all three UMC documents. Per the retrieval notes, the Medical Records page at `umcsn.com/patients-visitors/patient-information/medical-records-and-birth-certificate-process` links directly to this amendment form — but does **not** link to the actual ROI/release authorization forms (form-1 and form-2). A patient navigating the website looking for records access would find this form easily but might mistake it for a records request form, especially if they don't understand the distinction between requesting copies and requesting amendments.

The URL (`umcsn.com/getmedia/1dd2697c-e454-46e3-a217-a800685388a6/RequestforAmendmentPHI_English.pdf`) is reasonably descriptive — the filename `RequestforAmendmentPHI_English.pdf` clearly identifies the document's purpose and language.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present and functional. The full text (2,261 characters) extracts cleanly, confirming this is a digitally-composed document.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Like the companion ROI forms, this is a digital-origin PDF with no interactive form fields. Patients must print and hand-fill it.
- **File size**: 118 KB for a single page is reasonable.
- **Fonts**: 6 fonts used, 1 embedded image (likely a UMC logo).
- **Image-only scan**: No — proper text layer present.
- **Digital-first design**: The document was clearly created digitally (not scanned) but was not designed for digital completion. Given that this form requires the patient to also attach "A printed copy of the part of the medical record to be amended, with the specific PHI clearly marked," the lack of fillable fields may be less impactful than for an ROI form — there will always be a paper/physical component to this workflow.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality**: A single page is appropriate for this form's purpose. The content is well-proportioned — there's enough room for the required fields without excess blank space.

**Structure and organization**: The form follows a logical flow:
1. Patient identification header (with patient label area: Name, DOB, Age, Sex, CSN, MRN)
2. Instructions line
3. Patient demographics (Full Name, DOB, Photo ID, last 4 SSN digits, address)
4. Record identification (date of entry, account #, medical record #, encounter type, entry type)
5. Amendment description (free-text field for explanation)
6. Optional downstream notification (who else should receive the amendment)
7. Required attachments checklist
8. Submission methods
9. Legal acknowledgment and signature

**Clarity**: The language is mostly clear, though somewhat institutional. The instructions are direct: "Please complete and submit this form with all required attachments to the department of Health Information Management (HIM)." The amendment explanation field provides helpful guidance: "Please explain how the entry is incorrect or incomplete and specify what it should say to be more accurate or complete (If you need additional space, please attach another sheet of paper)."

The legal acknowledgment is plainly stated: "I understand UMC may or may not amend my Protected Health Information (PHI) based on this request and that the original entry(ies) in the record will not be altered."

**Layout**: The form uses a standard institutional layout with labeled fields and checkboxes. As with the ROI forms, the "PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW" header is a clinical convention that would confuse home-filling patients.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Purpose clarity**: The form clearly identifies itself as a "Request for Amendment" — a patient who finds this form should understand what it does. However, there is no explanatory text about when or why a patient might want to amend their records, or what the right to amend entails under HIPAA.

**Scope specification**: The form does a good job of requiring specificity — patients must identify the exact date, encounter type ("ex. Emergency Department visit, Clinic visit, etc."), and entry type ("ex. Progress Note, Transcribed report, etc.") to be amended, along with a written explanation. The examples are helpful for patients who may not know medical record terminology.

**Downstream notification**: The form asks "Would you like this amendment to be sent to anyone whom we may have disclosed this information to in the past?" — this reflects the HIPAA requirement that amendments be forwarded to prior recipients and gives the patient control by asking for specific names and addresses.

**Submission options**: The form provides four submission methods:
- Mail to: 1800 W. Charleston Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89102-2386 (Attention: HIM)
- Walk-in: HIM Department, Monday–Friday 8:00 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
- Fax to: 702-207-8330 (Attention: HIM)
- Email: HIMManagementAnalysts@umcsn.com

This is a notably strong set of submission options — particularly the inclusion of email and specific business hours for walk-in. Compare this favorably to the ROI forms (form-1 and form-2), which do not clearly state how to submit the completed authorization.

**Contact for questions**: A phone number (702-383-2228) is provided for questions — another practical touch missing from the ROI forms.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Photo ID requirement**: The form requires "Photo ID # & State of Issuance" and a "photocopy of the patient's photo ID" as a required attachment. For legal representative requests, it also requires "the requestor's photo ID, if requested by a legal representative." Identity verification is reasonable for amendment requests.

**SSN collection**: Requests "Last 4 digits of patient's Social Security #" — partial SSN collection is less concerning than full SSN but is not marked as optional (unlike form-1's ROI form which explicitly labels SS# as "(optional)").

**Required attachments**: The form requires "A printed copy of the part of the medical record to be amended, with the specific PHI clearly marked." This creates a dependency — the patient must already have a copy of their records before they can request an amendment. While logically necessary, this could create a circular barrier for patients who haven't yet obtained their records.

**No fee disclosure**: The form does not mention any fees associated with amendment requests. Under HIPAA, providers may not charge for the amendment itself, so the omission is appropriate.

**Acknowledgment language**: "I understand UMC may or may not amend my Protected Health Information (PHI) based on this request and that the original entry(ies) in the record will not be altered" — this correctly reflects that providers may deny amendment requests under certain circumstances and that amendments are appended rather than replacing original entries.

**Permanent record notice**: "THIS FORM IS PART OF THE OFFICIAL LEGAL MEDICAL RECORD" is stated at the bottom — transparent, if somewhat intimidating.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **SSN not marked optional**: The form asks for "Last 4 digits of patient's Social Security #" without indicating whether this is required or optional. The companion ROI form (form-1) properly marks SS# as "(optional)," but this form does not follow that convention.
- **"PLACE PATIENT LABEL TO COVER OR COMPLETE BELOW"**: Same issue as the ROI forms — this clinical convention assumes the patient is in a healthcare facility with access to a label printer. A patient at home would find this confusing.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Clear submission instructions with four methods**: Unlike the ROI forms (form-1/form-2) which fail to specify how to submit the completed form, this amendment form provides full contact details for mail, walk-in (with hours), fax (with number), and email (with address). This is a model that the ROI forms should adopt.
- **Downstream amendment notification option**: The form asks whether the patient wants the amendment forwarded to prior recipients, reflecting HIPAA's amendment-forwarding requirements and giving the patient meaningful control.
- **Helpful examples in field labels**: Prompts like "ex. Emergency Department visit, Clinic visit, etc." and "ex. Progress Note, Transcribed report, etc." help patients understand unfamiliar medical record terminology.
- **Contact phone number for questions**: Including "Please call 702-383-2228 with any questions" is a simple but valuable patient service gesture absent from the ROI forms.
