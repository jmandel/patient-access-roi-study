**Document:** form-1.pdf — "Authorization to Release Health Information"  
**Source URL:** https://www.hendrickhealth.org/documents/ROI-Form-Hendrick-Health-2024.pdf  
**Type:** Community hospital, regional system, nonprofit, South census region

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page general-purpose authorization form titled "AUTHORIZATION TO OBTAIN PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI)." It covers the hospital arm of Hendrick Health, specifically listing three facilities in the footer: Hendrick Medical Center (HMC), Hendrick Medical Center South (HMCS), and Hendrick Medical Center Brownwood (HMCB). The form includes a facility-selection line: `(Select Facility) ___HMC ____HMCB ____HMCS ____Other`.

A companion form (form-2.pdf) exists for Hendrick Clinic, the outpatient/clinic arm of the system. That form is structurally very similar but separately maintained, last revised 05/2022, whereas form-1 carries a "2024" designation in its URL and a footer reference "ROI and authorization to release PHI 4 2023." Patients needing records from both hospital and clinic encounters would need to complete two separate forms.

The form is a **general release/obtain authorization**, not a patient-access-specific request form. Its opening line reads: `I hereby authorize ____________________________________________________________ to obtain true and correct copies of the health care information`. This framing positions a named third party (or the patient themselves) as requesting records from/to an entity, rather than being structured as a straightforward "I want my own records" request.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Assessment: Easy to find.**

Per the retrieval notes, web searches for `Hendrick Health Abilene TX "authorization" "release" "health information" form PDF` immediately surfaced the form. The PDF has a descriptive, stable URL (`ROI-Form-Hendrick-Health-2024.pdf`). The Medical Records page at `https://www.hendrickhealth.org/patients-visitors/medical-records/` links to both hospital and clinic forms with clear descriptions. No browser automation, login, or portal access was required.

The URL filename includes the year "2024," providing version clarity. The retrieval agent reported "No difficulties" in finding either form.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Pages | 1 |
| File size | 341,642 bytes (~334 KB) |
| Text layer | Yes |
| Fillable fields | **0** |
| Font count | 14 |
| Embedded images | 3 |
| Image-only scan | No |

The form has an extractable text layer and is not a scan, which is positive. However, it has **zero fillable form fields** — it is a flat PDF designed to be printed and filled by hand. Despite being only one page, the file is 334 KB, which is large relative to its content; the 3 embedded images and 14 fonts contribute to this bloat.

The form is clearly a **print-first design** that was created digitally (likely from a Word document, given the `.docx` reference visible in form-2's footer). It is not a scanned paper form, but it offers no interactive digital functionality. A patient cannot type into the fields, check boxes electronically, or submit digitally. The "Email" delivery option checkbox and the listed fax number suggest submission would be via fax, mail, or in-person delivery of a printed, signed copy.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and density:** The form compresses a substantial amount of content onto a single page: patient demographics, dates of service, facility selection, record type checkboxes (16+ categories), delivery method, sensitive record initials, reason for disclosure, effective time period, right to revoke, signature authorization, two-column release/receive party identification, primary signature block, representative information, and a minor's signature section. This is dense but manages to remain on one page.

**Record type granularity:** The form provides good granularity in record selection with checkboxes for: History/Physical Exam, Past/Present Medications, Patient Allergies, Operation Reports, Discharge Summary, Diagnostic Test Results, Billing Information, Radiology Reports & Images, Lab Results, Consultation Reports, EKG/Cardiology Reports, Fetal Heart Strips, Physician's Orders, Progress Notes/Office Visits, Pathology Reports, and "All health information" with an "Other" write-in option. This is a reasonably comprehensive list.

**Sensitive records:** Four categories require separate initials — Mental Health Records (excluding psychotherapy notes), Genetic Information (including Genetic Test Results), Drug/Alcohol/Substance Abuse Records, and HIV/AIDS Test Results/Treatment. This is appropriate under Texas law and clearly distinguished from the general checkbox section with the note `** Your initials are required to release the following information`.

**Legal language:** The bottom third of the form contains three dense paragraphs of legal text (Effective Time Period, Right to Revoke, Signature Authorization). These are written at a high reading level and contain legal citations: `Texas Health & Safety Code § 181.154(c)` and `45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(1)`. The Signature Authorization paragraph is a single long sentence that runs approximately 5 lines. While legally necessary, this section would benefit from plain-language summarization.

**Layout:** The form uses a mix of checkbox grids, fill-in blanks (lines), and paragraph text. The two-column party identification section (who releases vs. who receives) is functional but visually crowded. The Hendrick Service Center's contact information is **pre-populated** on the left side (release party), which is helpful for patients.

**Minor's signature section:** Includes a reference to `Tex. Fam. Code § 32.003` and a brief explanation of when a minor's signature is required. This is a Texas-specific compliance feature.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form is structured as a general authorization to "obtain" PHI, not as a patient-access request. The opening reads `I hereby authorize ____________________________________________________________ to obtain true and correct copies of the health care information`. A patient requesting their own records must fill in their own name (or "Self") in this blank and also in the "WHO CAN RECEIVE" column. This works but is not intuitive — the form's framing assumes a third-party disclosure model.

**"Personal Use" reason:** The form does include "Personal Use" as a reason for disclosure option, which accommodates patient access, but it is one of seven options alongside Billing, Legal, Disability, Employment, Treatment/Continuing Medical Care, Insurance, and School. No additional guidance explains what "Personal Use" means or that patients have a right to their own records.

**Delivery options:** Four options are listed — Personal Pickup, Mail, Fax, and Email. The inclusion of **email** as a delivery method is notable and positive, offering a digital delivery pathway. However, no details are provided about format (paper copies, CD, electronic file format) or whether electronic delivery is HIPAA-compliant secure email vs. standard email.

**No Right of Access language:** The form does not reference HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). The only federal citation is `45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(1)`, which addresses permitted uses and disclosures generally. There is no mention of the patient's right to access their own records, timelines for fulfillment, or fee limitations.

**No EHI export mention:** There is no mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or USCDI.

**SSN request:** The form asks for "Last 4 of SSN." While limited to the last four digits (not full SSN), this is not required under HIPAA for a records request and may deter some patients.

---

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No unreasonable barriers observed:** The form does not require notarization, witnesses, or in-person submission. No fees are disclosed or referenced. The authorization duration is reasonable — valid until `the earlier of the occurrence of the death of the individual; the individual reaching the age of majority; or permission is withdrawn; or the following specific date (optional)`. The optional specific date is patient-controlled.

**Right to revoke:** Clearly stated — `I understand that I can withdraw my permission at any time by giving written notice`. The written-notice requirement for revocation is standard.

**Re-disclosure warning:** The form includes appropriate language: `information disclosed pursuant to this authorization may be subject to re-disclosure by the recipient and may no longer be protected by federal or state privacy laws`.

**Sensitive record categories:** The initials requirement for mental health, genetic, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS records is compliant with Texas and federal special-protection categories. This is appropriately handled.

**No bundling:** The form does not bundle the records release with other authorizations (e.g., treatment consent, payment authorization).

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ❌ ERRORS

- **"HIPPA" misspelling:** The form twice refers to "HIPPA regulations" — the correct acronym is **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). This error appears in the opening paragraph: `including any and all individually identifiable health information under HIPPA regulations`. This is a factual error that undermines the form's credibility and suggests insufficient review.

- **Version date confusion:** The URL says "2024" (`ROI-Form-Hendrick-Health-2024.pdf`) but the footer reads `ROI and authorization to release PHI 4 2023`. It is unclear whether "4 2023" means April 2023, version 4, or some other reference. The discrepancy between the URL year and the footer date is confusing.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Obtain" vs. "Release" framing:** The title says "Authorization to Release Health Information" but the body says "AUTHORIZATION TO OBTAIN PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION." These are opposite directions — releasing information sends it out; obtaining it brings it in. The form tries to serve both purposes (the two-column party identification allows either direction), but the conflicting title and subtitle may confuse patients about which party does what.

- **Two separate forms for one system:** Patients who have received care at both Hendrick Medical Center and Hendrick Clinic must complete two different forms. Nothing on form-1 explains this or directs patients to the clinic form if needed. A patient who only submits the hospital form may not realize their clinic records are excluded.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Email delivery option:** Including email as a delivery method is a positive feature that many ROI forms lack. This provides a digital delivery pathway for patients who prefer electronic access.

- **Pre-populated facility contact information:** The Hendrick Service Center's address, phone (325-670-2407), and fax (325-670-6538) are pre-filled on the form, reducing guesswork for patients about where to submit or who to contact.

- **Single-page format:** Despite containing substantial content, the form fits on one page, reducing the burden on patients who need to print and fill it out.

- **Granular record selection:** The 16+ record type checkboxes give patients meaningful control over what information is released, rather than forcing an all-or-nothing approach.
