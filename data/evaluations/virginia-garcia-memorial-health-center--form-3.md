## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Release of Verbal Health Information** form — English version. It is *not* a standard Release of Information (ROI) form for requesting copies of medical records. Instead, it serves two narrow purposes:

1. **Permission to verbally discuss PHI with family members/caregivers** — the patient lists up to three named individuals (name, phone, relationship) whom VGMHC staff may speak with about the patient's health.
2. **Permission to leave detailed voicemail messages** — the patient can authorize or decline detailed voicemails at a specified number.

Additionally, the form includes optional initials-based authorization for sensitive information categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse).

Within the suite of four forms found for Virginia Garcia, this is one of a pair of verbal-release forms (form-3 is English; form-4 is the Spanish equivalent). The main written ROI forms are form-1 (English) and form-2 (Spanish). This form is a companion document, not the primary mechanism a patient would use to request copies of their own records.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, all four forms were found on VGMHC's dedicated Patient Forms page at `https://virginiagarcia.org/get-care/patient-forms/` under a clearly labeled "Release of Information Forms" section. The form was discoverable in the first search. The filename (`Release-of-Verbal-Health-Information-English.pdf`) is descriptive and self-explanatory. However, the PDF links on the website are embedded in Divi theme JavaScript click handlers rather than standard HTML anchor tags, which could present accessibility barriers for screen readers or users trying to right-click and save. Overall findability is **good** — the forms page is logically organized and the verbal-release form is presented alongside the main ROI forms.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present and fully extractable. The extracted text is clean and well-structured with no OCR artifacts.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. Despite having clear blank fields for patient name, date of birth, three name/phone/relationship entries, a phone number for voicemails, initials lines for sensitive categories, and signature/date fields, none are interactive PDF form fields. The form must be printed and filled by hand.
- **File size**: 65,631 bytes for a single page — reasonable.
- **Fonts**: 6 fonts embedded.
- **Images**: 1 embedded image (likely a logo).
- **Digital design**: The form was clearly created digitally (not a scan), but it was not designed for digital completion. It is a print-first document.
- **Text artifact**: The extracted text contains "CertI hereby authorize" (a run-together of what appears to be a formatting artifact — likely "Cert" from a checkbox or form element bleeding into the text "I hereby authorize"). Similarly, "-ORI decline" appears to be a garbled rendering of a checkbox option for declining voicemails.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality**: One page for a narrowly scoped verbal-release authorization is appropriate and efficient.

**Clarity**: The introductory paragraph is somewhat dense legal language: *"Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center (VGMHC) restricts the release of Protected Health Information (PHI) to that permitted by patient confidentiality laws. According to HIPAA regulations, permitted reasons for release of PHI include treatment, payment, and healthcare operations..."* This preamble, while accurate, is written for compliance rather than patient comprehension. A patient might not easily parse why this context is relevant to a verbal-release form.

**Organization**: The form is logically structured into two numbered sections (verbal discussion permission; voicemail permission), followed by the sensitive-information opt-in, then patient acknowledgment statements and signature. This is clear and intuitive.

**Layout**: Three slots for authorized individuals (name, phone, relationship) is practical and well-sized for the typical use case. The form fits on a single page without appearing cramped.

**Acknowledgment statements**: Two bullet points clearly explain that the authorization lasts as long as the patient is active at VGMHC and that revocation must be in writing. The statement *"This form is not valid unless signed and dated"* is clear and direct.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Relevance to record access**: This form does **not** serve a patient requesting copies of their health records. It is solely about verbal communication permissions. A patient trying to obtain their medical records would need form-1 (or form-2 in Spanish) instead. The form does not reference or cross-link to the main ROI form.

**Scope**: The scope is appropriately narrow — it addresses only verbal disclosure and voicemail preferences. The sensitive-information opt-in (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse) provides granular control, which is patient-friendly.

**Duration**: The authorization is described as "valid as long as I am a patient of VGMHC," which is open-ended and avoids burdensome re-authorization requirements. This is reasonable for a verbal-communication permission.

**Voicemail opt-out**: The form includes an opt-out for detailed voicemails ("I decline. Please do not leave me detailed messages"), which gives the patient meaningful choice rather than defaulting to either disclosure or restriction.

**Format/delivery**: No electronic submission option is mentioned. No email or fax submission instructions appear on this form (unlike form-1, which lists a fax number). It is unclear how the patient should return the completed form.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**No unreasonable barriers**: The form does not require notarization, in-person submission, witness signatures, or fees. It is a straightforward authorization.

**Sensitive information handling**: The form correctly segregates HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse information behind an additional initials-based authorization, consistent with Oregon state law and federal 42 CFR Part 2 requirements.

**Revocation**: Revocation is permitted "in writing at any time," which is standard. No specific address or mechanism for revocation is provided on this form (in contrast to form-1, which gives a mailing address and mentions a Revocation of Authorization form).

**Missing elements**: The form does not include an expiration date or event (unlike form-1, which has a field for specifying an end date). Instead, it states the authorization lasts as long as the patient receives care at VGMHC. This is permissible but notable — some patients may not realize the authorization persists indefinitely until they leave care or revoke in writing.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Text extraction artifact**: The extracted text contains "CertI hereby authorize" and "-ORI decline" — these appear to be garbled renderings of checkbox/form elements that bleed into adjacent text. In the PDF itself, these likely render as separate visual elements, but the underlying text layer is malformed. This could cause problems for screen readers or text-extraction tools.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **No submission instructions**: Unlike form-1 (which provides a mailing address and fax number), this form gives no indication of where or how the patient should submit it once completed. A patient who downloads it from the website would not know whether to mail it, bring it in person, or fax it.
- **"Certain information cannot be released without specific authorization as required by state or federal law"** — the form lists three categories (HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse) but does not mention genetic testing, which *is* listed on the main ROI form (form-1). This omission could create confusion about whether genetic testing information is covered by the verbal-release authorization or excluded by default.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Bilingual availability**: The form is available in both English (form-3) and Spanish (form-4), reflecting the health center's community-serving mission as an FQHC.
- **Voicemail opt-out**: Including an explicit decline option for detailed voicemails ("I decline. Please do not leave me detailed messages") is a thoughtful privacy feature that many organizations omit.
- **Open-ended duration**: Tying authorization to the patient's care relationship rather than an arbitrary expiration date avoids the burden of periodic re-authorization for an ongoing need.
