## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **patient-specific request form** for obtaining one's own health information — distinct from the organization's general "Authorization to Release Protected Health Information" form (form-1.pdf). While form-1 is a two-page, third-party-oriented HIPAA authorization with detailed legal rights language and release-from/to structure, form-2 is a streamlined, one-page form designed specifically for patients requesting their own records.

The two forms serve complementary purposes: form-1 handles releases *to* third parties (insurance, providers, legal), while form-2 addresses patient *self-access*. The existence of a separate patient access form is itself a notable design choice — most organizations use a single, generic authorization form for both scenarios. Form-2's title, "Patient Request for Health Information Form," plainly signals its purpose. Both share the same form authorization code (CL.HIM.031), suggesting coordinated governance under the same HIM policy framework.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, forms were found via web search and the organization's forms page at https://ghcscw.com/members/forms/. The forms page is described as well-organized with a dedicated "Release of Information Forms" section. No bot blocking, login requirements, or other barriers were encountered.

However, there is a minor organizational quirk: form-2 was listed under the "Health Insurance Forms" section rather than the "Release of Information Forms" section, which could make it harder for a patient to discover if they are specifically browsing the ROI section. A patient looking under "Release of Information" would find form-1 but might miss this more patient-friendly option.

The URL (`Patient_Request_Health_Information_Form.pdf`) is descriptive and self-explanatory. The filename uses underscores and clearly labels the document. The upload date in the URL path (`2023/06`) suggests it was last updated in June 2023.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Format**: PDF v1.6, 1 page, 368 KB
- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable and clean. No OCR artifacts or garbled text.
- **Fillable fields**: 49 interactive form fields are reported in metadata, making this a fully fillable digital form. This is an excellent fillable field count for a single-page document — every input area appears to be interactive.
- **Image content**: 1 embedded image (likely a logo/header).
- **Digital-first design**: The form appears to be natively designed as a digital document, not a scan. The 7 fonts, clean text extraction, and high fillable field count confirm this.
- **File size**: 368 KB for a one-page fillable PDF is slightly large (likely due to the embedded image and font embedding) but entirely reasonable.

The form is technically well-constructed for digital use. A patient could fill it out on screen and submit it without printing.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportionality**: At one page, the form is impressively concise for the amount of functionality it packs in. It covers patient identification, record type selection, delivery method, and recipient designation without feeling cramped.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical flow:
1. Patient demographics (name, address, DOB, medical record number, phone)
2. Record type selection with date range ("What records do you want?")
3. Delivery method selection ("How would you like your records delivered?")
4. Recipient designation ("Where do you want the information sent?")
5. Signature and representative authority
6. HIPAA statement
7. HIM staff verification section

**Record type options**: The form offers 8 specific record categories via checkboxes: Billing Records, Office Visits, Eye Care Notes, Complementary Medicine, Mental Health, Procedures, X-Ray Images, and Physical/Occupational Therapy. Two additional categories allow specification: "Test Results (X-Ray, Lab/Pathology Results)" and "Other (Immunization Records, Medication Lists)." A date range field allows scoping by service dates.

**Language**: Plain and direct. Section headers are written as questions ("What records do you want?", "How would you like your records delivered?", "Where do you want the information sent?") — a patient-friendly approach that avoids legal jargon.

**Layout**: Checkbox-based design with clear grouping. The form uses a simple, functional layout without excessive visual complexity. Instructions like "(Please allow up to 5 business days for request processing)" are contextually placed where relevant.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This form is notably patient-centered in several respects:

**Delivery format options**: The form offers four delivery mechanisms:
- Paper (home delivery or in-person pickup at "Administrative Building – 1265 John Q Hammons Drive, Madison, WI 53717")
- Electronic: "Email, CD, USB, MyChart, Other"

The inclusion of MyChart as a delivery option is particularly notable — it leverages the patient portal for secure record delivery. The range of electronic options (email, CD, USB, MyChart) is unusually broad.

**Informed consent for unencrypted delivery**: The form includes a clear disclosure for electronic delivery: "If unencrypted, requester was informed and understands the risks of receiving records via unsecured mail and that personal health information could be accessed by a third party while in transit. Requester still wants the records in this manner." This appropriately informs patients about risks without creating a barrier.

**Encrypted email as default**: The form states "the email will be encrypted unless specified otherwise" — meaning encryption is the default, with unencrypted available only if the patient opts in. This is a privacy-respecting design choice.

**HIPAA Right of Access**: The form explicitly references this right: "GHC-SCW recognizes a patient's right under HIPAA to access copies of his/her health information." This is direct and appropriately placed.

**Recipient flexibility**: Patients can send records to themselves or to a "Personal Representative/Third Party," with options for mail, email, or fax delivery to the designated recipient.

**Scope control**: Date range fields and granular record type checkboxes give the patient meaningful control over what they receive.

**Processing timeline**: The form sets expectations: "Please allow up to 5 business days for request processing." This is a reasonable and transparent timeline.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee disclosure**: The form notes "There may be charges associated with processing a request and producing requested records" — vague but not misleading. It does not specify fee amounts, which leaves patients uncertain about costs.

**No notarization or in-person requirements**: The form does not require notarization. In-person pickup is offered as an option, not a requirement.

**Personal representative provisions**: The form accommodates representatives of minors, incompetent/incapacitated persons, and deceased patients, with appropriate legal authority checkboxes (Legal Guardian, Spouse of Deceased, Health Care Agent, Personal Representative, Other).

**No expiration clause**: Unlike form-1, which specifies a one-year expiration, form-2 does not include an expiration date for the request — appropriate since this is a one-time records request, not an ongoing authorization.

**Staff verification section**: The form includes an "HIM Department Verification" section requiring staff to verify "Demographic information (Name, DOB, Address, Phone Number, Email Address, Last 4 digits of SSN)." Notably, the form itself does not ask the patient for their SSN, yet the verification section references "Last 4 digits of SSN" — suggesting staff may need to verify identity through other means.

**Submission method**: The form itself does not explicitly state how to submit it (no mailing address, fax number, or email address printed on the form). Patients would need to refer to form-1 or the website for submission instructions. Form-1 provides multiple submission options including mail, fax, email to ghcroi@ghcscw.com, and in-person drop-off.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Separate patient access form**: Having a dedicated, simplified form for patient self-access — distinct from the third-party authorization form — is a best practice that most organizations do not follow. This reduces complexity and confusion for patients.
- **MyChart delivery option**: Offering patient portal delivery alongside traditional methods is forward-thinking and leverages existing infrastructure for secure record delivery.
- **Encrypted email as default**: The statement "the email will be encrypted unless specified otherwise" makes the secure option the default — a thoughtful privacy-by-design choice.
- **Question-based section headers**: Using plain-English questions ("What records do you want?") instead of bureaucratic labels ("Section IV: Record Type Designation") makes the form approachable.
- **One-page design**: Accomplishing comprehensive record request functionality in a single page demonstrates good information design.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No submission instructions on the form**: The form lacks any indication of where or how to submit it — no mailing address, fax number, email, or portal URL. A patient filling this out in isolation would not know what to do with the completed form. This is a significant gap compared to form-1, which includes full contact information.
- **Fee vagueness**: "There may be charges" provides no guidance on expected costs. Patients cannot make informed decisions without knowing approximate fees, and HIPAA limits what may be charged for patient access requests.
- **SSN reference in staff section**: The HIM verification section references "Last 4 digits of SSN" but the patient-facing portion never asks for this. It's unclear how or when this information would be collected.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Form date code suggests April 2020 vintage**: The code "MK20-35-0(4.20)F" suggests the form was created or last revised in April 2020, though it was uploaded to the website in June 2023. The form uses "his/her" pronouns, reflecting older style conventions.
