## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3 is an "Authorization to Disclose PHI (Protected Health Information)" — a general-purpose ROI authorization form. It shares the same form number (FTC24-5) as form-1.pdf but is a newer revision (07/16/2025 vs. 11/20/2024). It was found on a different page of the website — the Medical Records page (`/medical-records`) — rather than the Patient Forms page where form-1.pdf was found.

The two versions are nearly identical but have at least two substantive differences:
1. **Specialty offices list:** Form-3 lists "Occupational Health" under specialty offices, whereas form-1 has a duplicate "Behavioral Health" entry (an apparent error that form-3 corrects).
2. **Sensitive information categories:** Form-1 includes a "Reproductive Health" checkbox under Section 7 that form-3 omits entirely.

Form-2.pdf is unrelated — it is an Emergency Medical Authorization form for minor children (form #FTC11-4, revised 3/6/12), not an ROI document.

The existence of two slightly different versions of the same form on different pages of the same website is notable and creates potential confusion for patients.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Rating context:** The form was easy to locate. Per the retrieval notes, the overall retrieval difficulty was "Easy" — the form was reachable within 2 clicks from the homepage.

Form-3 specifically was found on the Medical Records page (`/medical-records`), linked under the label "Medical Records Request Form." This is a logical, patient-friendly location. However, a patient looking for this form might also find form-1 on the Patient Forms page — encountering two different versions of the same form with no indication of which is current.

The URL (`/media/2025/08/FTC24-5_Authorization_to_disclose_PHI_2.pdf`) is reasonably descriptive, including the form number and a meaningful name. The `_2` suffix suggests this is a second version, though this is not communicated to the patient on the webpage.

The Medical Records page presumably provides context about what the form is for, and the "Medical Records Request Form" label is clear and jargon-free. No portal login was required.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** Present — the full text is extractable (6,156 characters), confirming this is a digitally-authored document, not a scan.

**Fillable fields:** Zero. Despite being a digitally-created PDF, the form has no interactive form fields. All blanks are represented as underscores in the text (e.g., `"Patient Name: __________________________________________"`). This means patients must print the form and fill it out by hand, or use a PDF annotation tool.

**File format:** The document is a 2-page PDF at 166 KB with 4 fonts and 4 embedded images. The file size is reasonable for a 2-page document, though the 4 embedded images (likely logos or decorative elements) add some overhead.

**Digital-first design:** The form appears to be created in a word processor or layout tool (not scanned), with proper fonts and structure. However, the complete absence of fillable fields means it is designed as a print-and-sign document, not a digital-first workflow. There is no option for electronic signature or online submission.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** 2 pages — appropriate for the amount of information collected. The form is dense but not unreasonably long.

**Organization:** The form uses a clear numbered section structure (8 sections):
1. Patient Information
2. Person or Company Who Will Receive Information
3. Treatment Location
4. Purpose of Request
5. Information to Be Released
6. Format and Delivery of Information
7. Review and Approval (sensitive information consent)
8. Expiration and Signature

This progression is logical — identity → recipient → source → purpose → scope → format → consent → signature.

**Clarity:** The form uses a mix of plain language and necessary medical/legal terminology. Section headers like "PERSON OR COMPANY WHO WILL RECEIVE INFORMATION" are somewhat verbose but clear. The sensitive information consent language in Section 7 is written at a moderately complex reading level: *"I understand that the information to be released may include reference to sensitive information related to mental and behavioral health, genetic testing, HIV/AIDS, or other communicable diseases, drug or alcohol abuse, and / or reproductive health."*

**Record type granularity:** Section 5 offers an impressively detailed list of approximately 17 record type options with date fields, including Discharge Summary, History & Physical, Consultation Report, Operative Report, Laboratory Reports, Pathology Reports, Radiology Reports, Radiology Images, Therapy records, Immunization Records, Emergency Dept. Records, Clinic Visits, Billing Records, and "Entire Record" — plus an "Other" option and "Any future records through one year of signature."

**Whitespace and layout:** The form is moderately cramped, particularly Section 5 which packs many checkbox options with date-entry lines into limited space. The treatment location section (Section 3) lists many clinic locations with phone/fax numbers, consuming significant real estate. Text appears to use a standard readable font size (likely 10-11pt based on the text density).

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form includes a "Self (same info as above)" checkbox in Section 2, explicitly supporting patients requesting their own records. This is a positive feature. However, the form is fundamentally a general-purpose disclosure authorization — it's the same form whether a patient wants their own records or a third party wants them.

**Purpose options:** Section 4 offers "Personal," "Legal," "Insurance," "Continuation of Care," and "Other" — a patient requesting their own records would select "Personal."

**Scope options:** Excellent granularity. Patients can request specific record types with date ranges (Section 5), choose from many specific categories, or request their entire record. The "Entire Record From: (date or date range)" option is clearly available.

**Format and delivery options:** Section 6 offers four format options (CD — hospital only, Flash Drive, Encrypted Email, Paper) and three delivery methods (Fax, Mail, In-Person Pick Up). The inclusion of **encrypted email** as a delivery format is notable and patient-friendly. However, CD and Flash Drive are somewhat dated media choices.

**Right of Access language:** The form does not explicitly reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access. It states: *"I understand that I may refuse to sign this Authorization. If I do not sign this Authorization, Fisher-Titus Health will continue to provide treatment and seek payment for services provided."* This addresses non-retaliation but doesn't educate patients about their legal right to access their records.

**EHI Export / bulk data:** No mention of electronic health information export, USCDI, or any patient portal integration.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fees:** The form states: *"Fisher-Titus Health may charge a fee for providing the information specified above."* No fee schedule or amounts are disclosed on the form. The use of "may" is vague.

**Expiration:** Section 8 states the authorization "will automatically expire one year from the date signed below unless revoked or another date or event is written here." A 1-year expiration is standard and reasonable. The option to specify a different date or triggering event is a good flexibility feature.

**Revocation:** The form clearly states: *"I understand that I may revoke this Authorization in writing at any time, except to the extent that action has already been taken in response to the Authorization."* This is standard HIPAA-compliant language.

**Re-disclosure warning:** Present: *"I understand that the information disclosed pursuant to this Authorization may be subject to re-disclosure by the recipient and may no longer be protected under federal privacy law."*

**Treatment conditioning:** Appropriately addressed: *"If I do not sign this Authorization, Fisher-Titus Health will continue to provide treatment and seek payment for services provided."*

**Witness requirement:** The form includes a "Witness Signature" line with a date field. While not labeled as required, the presence of a witness line could be interpreted as a requirement, which HIPAA does not mandate for patient-requested access.

**SSN collection:** The form requests "SS#" (Social Security Number) in Section 1. While sometimes used for patient identification, collecting SSN on a form that may be faxed or mailed raises privacy concerns and is not required by HIPAA.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **SSN collection:** The form requests Social Security Number ("SS#") in the patient information section. This is unnecessary for record release requests and creates a privacy/identity theft risk, especially given the form may be submitted via fax or mail.
- **Witness signature line:** A "Witness Signature" line appears at the bottom. HIPAA does not require witness signatures for patient access requests, and this could be perceived as an additional barrier — especially if the patient does not have a witness readily available.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **Two versions of the same form on the website:** Form-1 (revised 11/20/2024) appears on the Patient Forms page, while form-3 (revised 07/16/2025) appears on the Medical Records page. Both carry form number FTC24-5 but differ in content (the Reproductive Health checkbox is present in form-1 but absent in form-3; the duplicate "Behavioral Health" entry in form-1 is corrected to "Occupational Health" in form-3). A patient could unknowingly use the older version, and the discrepancy in sensitive information categories could have legal consequences.
- **Fee disclosure is vague:** The statement *"Fisher-Titus Health may charge a fee"* gives no guidance on amounts, whether fees apply to patient access requests specifically, or how to obtain a fee schedule.
- **"Reproductive Health" checkbox removed:** Form-3 drops the "Reproductive Health" checkbox from the sensitive information consent section (Section 7) that was present in form-1. It's unclear whether this was intentional policy change or an oversight, and it raises questions about how reproductive health records are handled under this version.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **No fillable fields:** Despite being a digitally-authored PDF, the form contains zero interactive form fields, requiring patients to print and handwrite all entries.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Encrypted email delivery option:** Offering encrypted email as a format/delivery option is forward-thinking and significantly more convenient than requiring patients to pick up records in person or wait for mail.
- **Granular record selection:** Section 5 provides approximately 17 specific record type checkboxes with date fields, allowing patients fine-grained control over what is released rather than forcing an all-or-nothing approach.
- **"Self" checkbox:** Section 2's "Self (same info as above)" checkbox explicitly acknowledges patient self-requests, reducing the form's third-party-release feel.
- **Comprehensive treatment location list:** Section 3 lists all Fisher-Titus facilities with direct phone and fax numbers, giving patients clear contact information for the specific location that holds their records.
