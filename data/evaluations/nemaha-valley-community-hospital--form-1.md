# Evaluation: Nemaha Valley Community Hospital — form-1.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a 2-page "Authorization for Release of Health Information" form (#890-04, REV: 01-14). It is the primary ROI form used by both Nemaha Valley Community Hospital and Seneca Family Practice (co-branded with both entities' names, addresses, and phone numbers at the top of each page). Page 1 is the authorization itself — patient identification, recipient designation, purpose, record type checklist, legal disclosures, and signature block. Page 2 is an administrative cost-calculation worksheet showing copy fees, labor charges, and postage, along with a staff-use-only release tracking section.

A second document was downloaded for this organization (form-2.pdf), which is the hospital's Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), effective February 2026. The NPP is a related compliance document but not an ROI form. The hospital also offers a Spanish-language version of the authorization form (linked from the same Resources page but not separately evaluated here).

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was reasonably easy to find. Per the retrieval notes, it was located via the hospital's Resources page (https://nemvch.com/resources/) within 2 clicks from the homepage. A site-scoped web search (`site:nemvch.com authorization release medical records`) also surfaced it quickly. The download URL is descriptive: `https://nemvch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Authorization-for-Release.pdf`. The Resources page reportedly labels the link clearly as "Authorization for Release of Health Information."

However, the form was uploaded in October 2019 (per the URL path) and the document itself is dated REV: 01-14 (January 2014), meaning it is over a decade old. General web searches for the form using `filetype:pdf` did not produce direct results — only the site-scoped search and manual navigation were effective.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

This document is technically poor as a digital artifact:

- **Image-only scan**: The PDF contains zero extractable text. It consists of two grayscale CCITT-encoded images at 300 DPI (3304×2550 pixels each). The metadata confirms `has_text_layer: false`, `full_text_chars: 2` (just form-feed characters), `font_count: 0`, and `is_image_only_scan: true`.
- **No fillable fields**: `fillable_field_count: 0`. The form must be printed and filled by hand.
- **Landscape orientation with 270° rotation**: The PDF page size is letter (792×612 pts) with a 270° page rotation, meaning the form was scanned sideways. This can cause display issues in some PDF viewers.
- **Scanned from paper**: The PDF was created by a "SAVIN MP C6502" copier/scanner on August 8, 2016. It is a photocopy of a paper form, not a born-digital document.
- **File size**: 268,656 bytes for 2 pages of monochrome scanned content — reasonable compression for the image type but unnecessary bloat compared to what a text-based PDF would be.
- **No tagging or accessibility metadata**: `Tagged: no`, no metadata stream, no custom metadata. The document is completely inaccessible to screen readers.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Layout**: The form is laid out in landscape orientation. Both pages carry the dual-branded header with the Nemaha Valley Community Hospital and Seneca Family Practice logos, addresses, and phone numbers. The layout is functional but dated — it uses a typewriter-style font with hand-drawn lines and bullet-point checklists.

**Page 1 content and structure**: The authorization page follows a logical sequence:
1. Patient identification fields (name, MRN#, birthdate, SSN, telephone)
2. Authorization statement with blanks for the authorizing party
3. Recipient information (name, phone, address)
4. Purpose field
5. Checklist of 14 record types in a two-column bullet list (e.g., "Anesthesia Record," "Operative Reports/Records," "Billing Records," "Psychotherapy Notes," etc.)
6. Treatment date range field
7. Legal disclosure paragraphs covering sensitive information (HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse), re-disclosure warning, right to refuse, right to copy, expiration, and revocation instructions
8. Signature block

**Page 2 content**: This is an internal cost-calculation worksheet showing:
- Charge per copy at $0.03/sheet
- Labor at $3.90 per 15-minute increment (15-minute minimum)
- Postage line item
- Methodology notes: "Cost per sheet $0.01, Copier maintenance per sheet $0.01 & Cost per B/W copy $0.01" — these three items apparently sum to $0.03
- Additional notes: "cost per white envelope $0.10, cost per manila envelope $1.10, Cost per Memory Stick $10, CD $10, Standard mail postage $.49, postage machine lease $.03 & postage cost non-standard rate"
- Staff-use fields for release date, release method (pick-up, mail, fax), and ID verification

**Clarity**: The legal language on page 1 is reasonably clear for a healthcare authorization form. It uses complete sentences and covers key HIPAA authorization elements. However, it is presented as dense paragraph text with no bold headings or visual breaks between the legal disclosures. The form requests a Social Security Number, which is unusual and raises privacy concerns.

**Length**: Two pages is appropriate for an ROI form, though page 2 is entirely staff-facing and arguably should not be part of the patient-facing document.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is a general-purpose release authorization. It asks the patient to authorize disclosure "to" a named recipient — this is structured as a third-party release form, not as a patient access request under HIPAA § 164.524. There is no language distinguishing a patient requesting their own records from a patient authorizing release to an insurance company, attorney, or another provider. A patient wanting their own records would need to list themselves as the recipient.

**Scope options**: The form offers a checklist of 14 specific record types, which is a useful feature for patients who want targeted records. The form also includes a treatment date range field. However, there is no "all records" checkbox option.

**Format/delivery options**: The form itself offers no electronic delivery options. Page 2's cost calculation section mentions pick-up, mail, and fax as delivery methods — but no email or patient portal option. The cost sheet references Memory Stick ($10) and CD ($10) as media options, which were current in 2014 but are now outdated.

**Right of Access language**: The form does not reference HIPAA § 164.524 or the patient's right of access. It does not explain that patients have a right to obtain their records. The form references the right to refuse signing and the right to revoke, but these are standard authorization elements, not access rights.

**EHI/electronic export**: No mention whatsoever.

**SSN requirement**: The form includes a field for "SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER" as part of patient identification. While not explicitly marked as required, its prominent placement alongside name, birthdate, and MRN suggests it is expected. Collecting SSN for a records release is unnecessary and creates identity theft risk.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Fee structure**: The per-page rate of $0.03 is extremely low and well within HIPAA limits. However, the $3.90/15-minute labor charge (with a 15-minute minimum) is a flat labor fee that applies regardless of request size. For a patient requesting a small number of records under their right of access, HIPAA limits fees to a reasonable, cost-based amount — a minimum $3.90 labor charge on top of per-page fees could be questioned for very small requests, though it is not egregious.

**Media fees**: $10 for a Memory Stick or CD is a media charge. Under HIPAA's right of access rules, if a patient requests electronic copies, the covered entity may charge only for labor — the cost of portable media like a CD or USB drive can be included, but $10 may exceed the actual cost of a blank CD.

**Expiration**: The form includes a blank expiration field ("This authorization will expire on the following date or event:") and a footer note stating "Kansas SB 119 mandates that all authorizations are no longer valid after one year from the date of signature." This is a proper reference to Kansas state law.

**Revocation**: The form states the patient can revoke in writing and directs them to "MEDICAL RECORDS AT THE ABOVE PHONE NUMBERS." This is compliant.

**No notarization or witness requirement**: The form requires only the patient/representative signature, with no notary, witness, or in-person submission requirement explicitly stated. However, the lack of any submission instructions (no mailing address, no fax number, no email for form submission) means patients may not know how to submit the completed form without calling.

**Both pages labeled "Page 2 of 2"**: Both pages of the form are marked "Page 2 of 2" in the footer, which is a formatting error that suggests the original page 1 may have been a different document, or this is a pagination mistake from the original form design.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Social Security Number field**: The form prominently requests the patient's SSN alongside other identifiers. SSN collection is unnecessary for medical records release (MRN, name, and DOB are sufficient) and creates significant identity theft risk. This is especially concerning given the form has no text layer and would need to be physically mailed or hand-delivered.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **No distinction between patient access and third-party release**: The form treats all releases identically. A patient requesting their own records under HIPAA's right of access has different rights (faster turnaround, fee limits) than a third-party authorization. The form's structure — requiring the patient to name a recipient and purpose — frames every request as a third-party disclosure rather than a patient access request.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no guidance on how to submit it. There is no mailing address for the records department, no fax number for submissions, and no mention of in-person drop-off. The only contact information is the main hospital and clinic phone numbers in the header.
- **Expiration field left to patient**: The authorization has a blank expiration line but also states Kansas law limits it to one year. It is unclear whether the patient must fill in an expiration date or whether the one-year statutory limit applies automatically.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Both pages numbered "Page 2 of 2"**: Both the authorization page and the cost worksheet are labeled "Page 2 of 2" in the bottom margin. This suggests a missing page 1 or a copy/pagination error. The form appears to be complete, so this is likely a labeling mistake.
- **Decade-old revision**: The form is dated REV: 01-14 (January 2014) and was scanned in August 2016, then uploaded to the website in October 2019. It does not reflect current practices (e.g., electronic delivery, patient portal access) or current fee schedules.
- **Outdated media references**: Offering CDs and Memory Sticks at $10 each as delivery media reflects 2014-era technology. These media are largely obsolete for healthcare record delivery.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish-language version available**: The hospital offers a separate Spanish-language authorization form on the same Resources page, which is notable for a small rural critical access hospital in Kansas.
- **Granular record-type checklist**: The 14-item checklist of specific record categories (including less common types like psychotherapy notes, social work reports, and respiratory therapy records) gives patients meaningful control over what is released.
- **Very low per-page copy fee**: At $0.03/page, the copying charge is minimal and patient-friendly.
