# Desert Valley Hospital — form-3.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**This is not a Release of Information form.** form-3.pdf is titled "AUTHORIZATION FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES" and originates from Desert Valley Medical Group (12401 Hesperia Road, Suite 9 & 10, Victorville, CA 92395) — an affiliated medical group, not Desert Valley Hospital itself. The form is used to authorize occupational health services such as DOT physicals, pre-employment drug screens, audio tests, pulmonary function tests, and similar employer-requested medical evaluations.

The form is a 1-page document (form number not printed; revision date "Rev. 06/23") that an employer fills out to authorize specific employment-related medical services for an employee or prospective employee. It includes fields for employer information, services requested (via a checklist), and where to send results. The instruction "PLEASE BRING THIS AUTHORIZATION WITH YOU" confirms this is something an employer gives an employee to present at the clinic — it is not patient-initiated.

**Relationship to other forms found:** Three forms were retrieved for this organization:
- **form-1.pdf**: Prime Healthcare Employee Health Plan ROI form (employee-only, PHSI-320-012) — wrong audience
- **form-2.pdf**: Patient-facing ROI form from Chino Valley Medical Center, a sister Prime Healthcare facility (PHSI-280-014) — the closest analog to Desert Valley Hospital's actual patient ROI form
- **form-3.pdf** (this document): Employment services authorization from Desert Valley Medical Group — entirely different document type

None of the three forms is a patient ROI form published by Desert Valley Hospital itself.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was found on the Desert Valley Medical Group website (desertvalleymedicalgroup.com), not on Desert Valley Hospital's site (dvmc.com). Per the retrieval notes, it was "the only downloadable authorization-type form found on the Desert Valley Medical Group website." The source URL is `https://desertvalleymedicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Authorization-for-Employment-services-8.pdf`.

Because this is not an ROI form, findability is essentially moot for the study's purposes. A patient searching Desert Valley Hospital's website for a medical records release form would never encounter this document — it lives on a separate affiliated website and serves an entirely different function.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present. The full text is extractable (896 characters), indicating this is a digitally-composed document, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero. Despite being a digital PDF, there are no interactive form fields. All entries must be handwritten or the form must be printed and completed manually.
- **File size**: 2,572,802 bytes (2.5 MB) for a single-page form with only 896 characters of text. This is grossly oversized — roughly 25× what would be expected. The 2 embedded images (likely a logo or decorative elements) likely account for this bloat, suggesting uncompressed or poorly optimized image assets.
- **Font count**: 3 fonts — reasonable for a simple form.
- **Digital-first design**: The text layer and clean extraction suggest digital composition, but the lack of fillable fields and the "PLEASE BRING THIS AUTHORIZATION WITH YOU" instruction indicate this was designed as a print-and-fill document.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 1 page — appropriate for the form's simple purpose.

**Organization**: The form has a logical top-to-bottom flow:
1. Clinic header with address/phone/fax and hours
2. Title ("AUTHORIZATION FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES")
3. Patient/employee identification fields (Name, Occupation, Employer details)
4. Services requested checklist (16 service types in a grid)
5. Results delivery instructions ("Fax or Email results to:" and "Special Instructions:")
6. Authorizer identification and billing
7. Appointment date/time

**Clarity**: Language is straightforward and jargon-appropriate for its audience (employers and occupational health staff). Terms like "DOT Physical Pre-employment," "Rapid Drug Screen," and "Pulmonary Function" are standard occupational health terminology.

**Services checklist**: Includes 16 specific service types: DOT Physical Pre-employment, Audio, Chest 1 View, Non-DOT Drug Screen, Basic Physical Pre-employment, Return to Work Basic Physical, Chest 2 View, DOT Drug Screen, Tuberculosis, Vision/Color Blindness, L Spine 3 View, Rapid Drug Screen, Hepatitis B Series, Pulmonary Function, Hair Collection, Breath Alcohol Test, Return to Work DOT Physical, and Physical Agility with weight specification.

**Layout**: Based on text extraction, the form appears reasonably organized with clear section groupings. The service checkboxes are arranged in what appears to be a multi-column grid format.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

This form is entirely irrelevant to patient access to medical records. It serves employers requesting occupational health services — the "patient" in this context is an employee being sent by their employer, not someone exercising their right to access health information.

- **No connection to HIPAA Right of Access**: The form does not reference patient rights, HIPAA, or records release.
- **No scope or format options for records**: The form concerns services to be performed, not records to be released.
- **Employer-driven**: The authorization is completed by the employer ("Authorization for treatment by (Print Name)" with "Title" field), not the patient.
- **Results go to employer**: "Fax or Email results to:" directs output to the employer, consistent with occupational health workflows but not patient-directed access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

As this is not an ROI form, HIPAA Right of Access compliance is not applicable. However, a few observations about the form's own domain:

- The form authorizes release of employment-related medical results (drug screens, physicals, etc.) to the employer. In occupational health contexts, this is typically governed by specific employer-employee consent frameworks and DOT/OSHA regulations rather than HIPAA's general authorization requirements.
- The form lacks any explicit patient consent language, privacy notice, or acknowledgment of the employee's rights regarding their own results — though this may be handled through separate employment agreements.
- There is no expiration date field, no revocation language, and no notice about re-disclosure.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Not an ROI form at all**: This document was retrieved during the search for Desert Valley Hospital's ROI form but is an entirely different document type (employment services authorization). Its presence in the results underscores the complete absence of an actual patient-facing ROI form from either Desert Valley Hospital or Desert Valley Medical Group's websites.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **No patient consent language**: The form authorizes an employer to request services and receive results, but contains no explicit language indicating the employee/patient has consented to the disclosure of their results to the employer. The "Authorization for treatment by (Print Name)" field appears to be for the employer's representative, not the patient.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Massive file size**: At 2.5 MB for a single page with 896 characters of text, the file is approximately 25× larger than expected. This suggests unoptimized embedded images — a technical defect that wastes bandwidth and storage.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Clear service checklist**: The 16-item occupational health services checklist is well-organized and comprehensive for its purpose, covering DOT and non-DOT testing, imaging, vaccination, and physical agility assessments.
