# Valley Medical Group — form-2.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a **Spanish-language authorization form for the release of medical records**, produced by MediCopy (a third-party Release of Information vendor based in Nashville, TN). The title reads "Autorización para la Divulgación de Registros Médicos." It is a 1-page PDF (277,663 bytes) with a text layer and 1 embedded image (the MediCopy logo).

Valley Medical Group does not produce its own ROI forms. Both form-1.pdf (English) and form-2.pdf (Spanish) are generic MediCopy forms — neither is branded or customized for Valley Medical Group. This form is the direct Spanish counterpart of form-1.pdf. The VMG website links patients to MediCopy's patient portal (https://medicopy.net/patients) via a "REQUEST RECORDS" link on the homepage, and from MediCopy's site the PDF authorization forms (English and Spanish) are available for download.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form is **not hosted on vmgma.com** itself. The path to reach it is:

1. Visit vmgma.com → click "REQUEST RECORDS" link (visible in homepage header/footer)
2. Land on https://medicopy.net/patients
3. Navigate to MediCopy's ROI landing page (https://medicopy.net/landing/roi)
4. Download the Spanish PDF

This is approximately **3–4 clicks** from the VMG homepage. The source URL (https://medicopy.net/sites/default/files/2023-12/MediCopy%20MRO%20Authorization%20%28Spanish%29.pdf) is hosted on MediCopy's domain, not VMG's. A patient searching specifically for VMG's Spanish-language records release form via web search would be very unlikely to find this document directly — there is no VMG-specific indexable page advertising a Spanish form. The filename is descriptive ("MediCopy MRO Authorization (Spanish).pdf"), but carries no indication of which provider it belongs to.

A Spanish-speaking patient who visits vmgma.com would need to know to click "REQUEST RECORDS," navigate MediCopy's English-language site, and locate the Spanish PDF option — a nontrivial task given that MediCopy's site is in English.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer:** Yes — full text is extractable (2,575 characters). This is a digitally-created PDF, not a scan.
- **Fillable fields:** Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite having clear blank lines and checkboxes, the form has no interactive form fields. A patient must print, fill by hand, and submit physically or by fax/scan.
- **Font count:** 7 fonts embedded, indicating some typographic variety.
- **File size:** 278 KB for a single page — reasonable.
- **Page count:** 1 page — compact.
- **Image-only scan:** No — this is a born-digital document.

The lack of fillable fields is a significant shortcoming for a digitally-distributed PDF. The form is designed for print-and-fill workflow despite being delivered digitally. MediCopy does offer an online HelloSign alternative (https://app.hellosign.com/s/01LCH5zj), but it is unclear whether that online option is available in Spanish.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure and sections:**
The form is organized into five logical sections:
1. "¿Dónde están los registros procedentes de?" (source facility)
2. "Información del paciente" (patient demographics)
3. "¿Dónde estamos enviando los registros?" (recipient)
4. "¿Qué te gustaría lanzado?" (record type selection)
5. "La Firma del Paciente" (authorization/signature block)

**Translation quality — significant issues:**
The Spanish translation contains multiple awkward or incorrect phrasings that suggest machine translation with limited human review:

- **"¿Qué te gustaría lanzado?"** — This translates roughly to "What would you like thrown/launched?" The intended meaning is "What would you like released?" A more natural phrasing would be "¿Qué información desea que se divulgue?" The use of "lanzado" (thrown/launched) is a mistranslation of "released."
- **"Si no desea que ciertas partes de su historia clínica publicadas"** — grammatically incomplete; should be something like "sean publicadas" or "sean divulgadas." The word "publicadas" (published) is also an odd choice for medical record release.
- **"Categorías Específicas"** appears as a subheading under the release section but is awkwardly placed.
- The informal "te" in "¿Qué te gustaría" clashes with the formal "usted" forms used elsewhere ("Si no desea que..."), creating an inconsistent register.

**Layout:** The form fits on a single page, which is efficient. The checkbox and field layout appears clean based on the extracted text structure. The authorization paragraph at the bottom is a dense legal block that is harder to parse than the rest of the form.

**Length:** Appropriate — 1 page is proportionate for a basic authorization form.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form is a general-purpose release form, not specific to patient self-access. It treats all requests identically — the patient fills in both "where records come from" and "where we're sending them." There is no streamlined pathway for a patient simply requesting their own records.

**Purpose of disclosure options:** The form lists: "Uso Personal," "Litigio/Legal," "Seguro," and "Transferencia de la Atención." The "Transferencia de la Atención" option includes a parenthetical note: "(últimos dos años se ha enviado a un médico sin costo)" — indicating last two years sent to a physician at no cost. "Uso Personal" (Personal Use) is listed but there is no indication that personal-use copies under HIPAA Right of Access should also be available at a reasonable cost-based fee.

**Scope options:** The form provides checkboxes for: Todos los Registros, Notas Clínicas, Radiología, Informes Operativos, Laboratorios, Vacunas, Otro, and a date range field ("Fechas ___ a ___"). This is a reasonable level of granularity.

**Sensitive records handling:** The form includes an opt-out exclusion section for Substance Abuse, AIDS/HIV/STDs, and Psychological/Psychiatric conditions. This reverses the usual opt-in approach — the default is to release sensitive records unless the patient checks boxes to exclude them.

**Delivery methods:** Email, Fax, "Recoger" (Pick up), and "Franqueo" (Postage) are offered, with a note that an additional fee applies to postage ("se aplica una tarifa adicional"). Email delivery is available, which is positive.

**Fee disclosure:** The form states: "HIPAA por 45 CFR 164.524, se le puede cobrar una tarifa razonable para la reproducción de los registros médicos. Las tarifas no son reembolsables una vez que se prestan los servicios." This references the correct HIPAA section but does not disclose actual fee amounts.

**SSN collection:** The form requests SSN with a partial pre-fill format ("SSN: XXX-XX-____"), asking for the last 4 digits. Collecting SSN on a records release form is unnecessary and raises privacy concerns.

**Right of Access language:** The authorization paragraph states: "Entiendo que puedo negarme a firmar esta autorización y mi proveedor de atención médica no puede condicionar el tratamiento a mi firma de esta autorización." This is a correct translation of the HIPAA provision that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing the authorization.

**EHI Export:** No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization validity:** 12 months from date of signature — reasonable and standard.

**Revocation rights:** The form states patients can cancel with written notification, and that it won't affect information already released. This is appropriate.

**Fee language:** The form cites 45 CFR 164.524 and states a "reasonable fee" may be charged. However, it also notes "Las tarifas no son reembolsables una vez que se prestan los servicios" (fees are non-refundable once services are rendered) and that postage incurs an "additional fee." No actual fee schedule is provided.

**Sensitive records default:** The form defaults to releasing all records including sensitive categories (substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, psychiatric) unless the patient affirmatively opts out. While technically the patient is signing an authorization, the default-release approach for 42 CFR Part 2 substance abuse records may be problematic depending on how strictly the facility interprets federal substance abuse confidentiality regulations.

**No notarization or witness requirement:** The form requires only the patient's signature, relationship to patient, and date. No notarization or witness is required.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **SSN collection:** The form requests Social Security Number (last 4 digits). This is unnecessary for a medical records release and creates an identity theft vector. HIPAA does not require SSN for records requests, and best practice is to use medical record numbers or date of birth for identification.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Fee amounts undisclosed:** The form references HIPAA 45 CFR 164.524 and mentions "tarifa razonable" but provides no actual fee schedule. Patients have no way to estimate costs before submitting the form. The postage "additional fee" is also unspecified.
- **Default release of sensitive records:** The opt-out framing ("please check categories you would like excluded") means a patient who doesn't carefully read this section will have substance abuse, HIV, and psychiatric records released by default. This is the opposite of the opt-in approach that better protects patient interests.
- **"Relationship to patient" field with no guardian/representative guidance:** The form has a "Relación con el Paciente" field but provides no instructions about who may sign on behalf of a minor or incapacitated patient, or what documentation is needed.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Poor translation — "lanzado" for "released":** The section header "¿Qué te gustaría lanzado?" uses "lanzado" (thrown/launched), a mistranslation of "released." This would confuse native Spanish speakers.
- **Grammatical errors:** "Si no desea que ciertas partes de su historia clínica publicadas" is missing a verb form — should be "sean publicadas" or "sean divulgadas." The mixing of informal "te" and formal "usted" forms is inconsistent.
- **"Publicadas" vs. "divulgadas":** The word "publicadas" (published) is used where "divulgadas" (disclosed/released) would be the correct medical-legal term, especially since the form's own title uses "Divulgación."

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish-language availability:** Providing a Spanish version of the authorization form at all is a positive step. Many healthcare organizations offer only English-language ROI forms. For a practice in western Massachusetts with a Spanish-speaking population, this is meaningful.
- **Single-page design:** The entire form fits on one page, reducing the burden on patients compared to multi-page authorization forms.
- **Email delivery option:** Offering email as a delivery method enables faster, lower-cost access to records.
- **Clear revocation and non-conditioning language:** The form clearly states that treatment cannot be conditioned on signing the authorization and that the patient may revoke at any time in writing.
