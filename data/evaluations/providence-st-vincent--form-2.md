**Source URL**: https://www.providence.org/-/media/project/psjh/shared/files/roi/english-psjh-patient-request-for-access.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-2 is titled **"Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set"** and is a system-wide PSJH form (form number 940507, dated 3/27/25). It is specifically designed for patients requesting their own records or disclosing to a named recipient—distinct from form-1 ("Authorization to Use, Disclose & Release Protected Health Information"), which is the general ROI authorization covering both patient access and third-party release. Form-3 is an older OR/MT-specific predecessor to form-2, sharing the same title pattern but with outdated contact information (referencing "PH&S" instead of "PSJH" and older phone/fax/email). Form-2 appears to be the current, system-wide replacement for form-3, with updated vendor contact information (R1RCM).

Of the three forms found for this organization, form-2 is the most relevant for a patient at Providence St. Vincent seeking their own records: it is patient-access-specific, the most recently dated, and uses the current PSJH branding and contact information.

## 2. FINDABILITY

Per the retrieval notes, no facility-specific form exists for St. Vincent Medical Center; all forms are published at the Providence system level. Finding this form required:

1. Searching for the parent system rather than the individual facility.
2. Navigating to the Health Information Management page at `providence.org/about/medical-records-authorization/health-information-management`.
3. Identifying the correct form among three overlapping options (form-1 for general authorization, form-2 for patient access, form-3 as an older patient-access version).

The URL (`english-psjh-patient-request-for-access.pdf`) is descriptive and suggests the form exists in multiple languages. However, the retrieval notes indicate the initial search for "Providence St. Vincent Medical Center" did not surface this form directly—only searching for the parent system name led to it. A patient searching specifically for their facility would need to know to look at the system-level website. The HIM page itself was described as "the most comprehensive source," listing multiple forms with instructions, which is helpful once found.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer**: Present. The full extracted text is 5,970 characters across 3 pages, all cleanly extractable via pdftotext.

**Fillable fields**: The form has **72 fillable fields**, the highest count among the three Providence forms (form-1 has 42, form-3 has 50). This is a genuinely digital-first document with interactive fields for patient information, recipient information, delivery options, record type selections, date ranges, sensitive information authorization, and signature fields.

**File size**: At 96,585 bytes (97 KB) for 3 pages, this is compact and efficient—the smallest of the three forms (form-1 is 283 KB, form-3 is 755 KB).

**Fonts**: 5 fonts embedded, suggesting a clean, consistent design without excessive typographic variation.

**Images**: 2 embedded images (likely logos or headers).

**PDF version/format**: Digital-native design. Not a scan. The clean text extraction, high fillable field count, and small file size all indicate a born-digital document created in a form design tool.

**Signature**: The form includes signature fields but the text says "Patient Signature:" followed by a "Date:" field. Unlike form-1 and form-3, which instruct "(Print form and sign by hand)," form-2 does **not** include that instruction in the extracted text, suggesting it may accept digital signatures or be designed for electronic submission.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: 3 pages. Page 1 is instructional/informational (mailing address, contact info, disclaimers, language assistance). Pages 2-3 are the actual form fields. This is a reasonable length.

**Structure**: The form is organized into clearly labeled sections:
- Introductory explanation and instructions (page 1)
- Patient information fields (page 2)
- "USE AND DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION" with recipient options (page 2)
- Delivery options: "M MyChart / M Paper (Mailed) / M CD (Mailed) / M FAX / M Email" (page 2)
- "INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED" with hospital listing and date range (page 2)
- Record type selection with two tiers: "Pertinent information" vs. "All/Entire Medical Record" plus "Other" and "Last two years only" (pages 2-3)
- Sensitive information categories requiring separate initials (page 3)
- Purpose selection (page 3)
- Expiration section (page 3)
- "MY RIGHTS" section (page 3)
- Signature block (page 3)

**Clarity**: The language is mostly clear but contains some legal/regulatory jargon. The opening paragraph states: "Completion of this document authorizes the disclosure and/or use of health information about you. Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization." The warning about invalidation is somewhat intimidating. The record type descriptions are helpful—the "Pertinent information" option explains exactly what it includes: "Discharge Summary, Emergency Department Report, History and Physical, Consultations, Operative Reports, Labs, Radiology Reports, EEG, EMG, EKG, Pathology Reports."

**Layout**: The checkbox notation "M" (representing checkboxes) and structured field layout suggest a well-organized visual design. Sections are clearly delineated with headers in caps.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access focus**: This form is explicitly designed for patient access. The title is "Patient Request to Access/Disclose a Designated Record Set," and the first disclosure option is "I hereby authorize PSJH to release my medical records to: M Myself OR M Recipient listed below." This is a meaningful improvement over a generic third-party authorization form.

**Scope options**: The form offers granular control:
- Specific hospital(s) and dates of treatment
- Record type tiers: "Pertinent information" (common records), "All/Entire Medical Record," "Other (specify)," and "Last two years only" with sub-options
- Sensitive information categories requiring separate initials: Mental Health, HIV test results, Alcohol/drug treatment, Sexually Transmitted Disease (WA Only)

**Delivery format options**: Five options are offered: MyChart, Paper (Mailed), CD (Mailed), FAX, and Email. This is excellent—MyChart and email provide immediate electronic access.

**Rights language**: The "MY RIGHTS" section explicitly states: "I may refuse to sign this authorization. If I refuse to sign this authorization, I should know that by law, my health information cannot be released. My refusal will not affect my ability to obtain treatment or payment or eligibility for benefits." It also notes the right to inspect records, revoke authorization in writing, and receive a copy of the authorization. However, it does not cite HIPAA § 164.524 by name.

**EHI Export awareness**: No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or 21st Century Cures Act/information blocking.

**Fee disclosure**: The form mentions fees twice: "there may be a fee for production of the medical records" (page 1) and "(A fee may be charged)" next to the Pertinent and All/Entire record options. Fees are disclosed as possible but no amounts are specified.

**Language access**: The form includes language assistance notices in English, Spanish, and Chinese, with a phone number (888-311-9127) and TTY line (711). The URL contains "english-" prefix, suggesting other language versions exist.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: "This Authorization expires (Date): _______________. If no Date is given, this authorization will expire in six months from the signature date." A six-month default expiration is reasonable.

**Revocation**: Revocation must be submitted "in writing" to the PSJH PO Box in Portland. This is standard.

**Physician release gate**: The form includes a section at the bottom labeled "HOSPTIAL USE ONLY" (note the typo—"HOSPTIAL") with "PHYSICIAN RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORD" containing "APPROVED by Physician Name" and "DENIED – REASON FOR DENIAL" fields. This suggests that in some cases, a physician must approve the release of records before they are provided to the patient.

**Sensitive information**: The form requires separate initials for Mental Health, HIV, Alcohol/drug treatment, and STD (WA only) records. This is standard practice driven by state and federal statutes but adds friction.

**Submission method**: The form directs submission to a centralized PO Box, email (ROIHIMreception@r1rcm.com), or fax. Multiple submission channels are available, which is good—no in-person requirement.

**Re-disclosure warning**: Included twice (pages 1 and 3): "Information disclosed pursuant to this authorization could be re-disclosed by the recipient. Such re-disclosure is in some cases not protected by state law and may no longer be protected by federal confidentiality law (HIPAA)."

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Physician approval gate for patient access**: The "HOSPITAL USE ONLY" section includes a physician approval/denial workflow ("APPROVED by Physician Name" / "DENIED – REASON FOR DENIAL"). Under HIPAA § 164.524, a covered entity may deny access only in narrow circumstances (e.g., psychotherapy notes, information compiled for legal proceedings). A blanket physician-approval gate on patient access requests could constitute an unreasonable barrier if used broadly. The form states: "Dependent on State Regulations, authorization from the physician who attended the patient during their stay may be required."

- **Fee warning without amounts or HIPAA limits**: The form warns "there may be a fee" and "(A fee may be charged)" but provides no information about fee amounts, HIPAA's cost-based fee limitation for patient access requests, or any distinction between patient-access fees and third-party release fees. Under HIPAA, fees for patient access are limited to reasonable, cost-based amounts.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Failure to provide all information requested may invalidate this authorization"**: This opening warning is vague and potentially intimidating. It doesn't clarify which fields are truly required vs. optional, and "invalidate" suggests the entire request could be rejected for a single missing field.

- **Hospital-only vs. clinic records**: The form says "Please forward this form, for Hospital Medical Record Requests ONLY." This raises the question of how patients request clinic/outpatient records—a separate process? A different form? This is not explained.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo: "HOSPTIAL USE ONLY"** — "HOSPITAL" is misspelled as "HOSPTIAL" in the internal-use section header.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Patient-access-specific form**: Unlike many health systems that only offer a generic third-party release authorization, Providence provides a dedicated form for patients requesting their own records, with "Myself" as the first disclosure option.

- **Five delivery format options including MyChart and email**: Offering MyChart, Email, Paper, CD, and FAX gives patients real choice in how they receive records, including immediate electronic options.

- **72 fillable fields**: This is a genuinely interactive PDF—patients can complete the entire form digitally before printing/submitting, reducing errors from handwriting and incomplete submissions.

- **Multilingual language assistance notice**: Includes English, Spanish, and Chinese notices with a toll-free number and TTY access. The URL suggests additional language versions of the form itself may exist.

- **Multiple submission channels**: Patients can submit via mail, email, or fax—no in-person requirement.
