# Neshoba General Hospital — form-1.pdf Evaluation

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

**form-1.pdf is not a Release of Information form.** It is an "EMPLOYER AUTHORIZATION FORM" used for occupational health services — DOT physicals, pre-employment physicals, return-to-work physicals, drug and alcohol testing, and workers' compensation billing. The form header reads "EMPLOYER AUTHORIZATION FORM" and the instruction line says "Send this form with employee to preferred Neshoba General facility." It is designed for employers to authorize employee visits for workplace-related medical services, not for patients to request their own health records.

This was the only authorization-adjacent document found on the Neshoba General Hospital website. No actual ROI or medical records release form exists online. The retrieval agent downloaded this form for completeness because it was the closest thing to an "authorization form" available. The form was sourced from the Wayback Machine archive of `neshobageneral.com/documents/Employer-Authorization-Form_Fillable.pdf`.

No other forms were found for this organization. A thorough search — including multiple web queries, full website navigation, URL guessing for common PDF paths, Wayback Machine CDX API queries, and third-party ROI vendor checks — turned up zero ROI forms.

## 2. FINDABILITY

**No ROI form is findable online for Neshoba General Hospital.** The retrieval notes document an exhaustive search process:

- **Nine different web search queries** were attempted using various keyword combinations ("authorization," "release," "health information," "medical records," filetype:pdf, site-scoped searches) — none returned an ROI form.
- **Full website navigation** covered the home page, Patient & Visitors landing, Patient Information, Case Management, Financial Services, Community Resources, Patient Portal Info, Privacy Policy, and Site Map pages. No link to any medical records release form exists.
- **URL guessing** tried common document paths (e.g., `/documents/Authorization-for-Release-of-Health-Information.pdf`, `/documents/release-of-information.pdf`) — all returned 404.
- **Wayback Machine** indexed only 9 PDFs from the entire site history; none were ROI forms.
- **Third-party ROI services** (Ciox, MRO, Datavant, HealthMark, Verisma, MedicalRecords.com) showed no association.

The website has no "Medical Records" or "Health Information Management" section. There is no HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices PDF published (only a generic website privacy policy). The only way to obtain an ROI form appears to be calling (601) 663-1200 or visiting in person.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

Because form-1.pdf is not an ROI form, its technical qualities are not directly relevant to the study's core question. However, for completeness:

- **Text layer**: Present. Full text is extractable via pdftotext (2,581 characters).
- **Fillable fields**: 54 interactive form fields — a high count for a 1-page document, indicating genuinely digital-first design. Field names are not enumerated in metadata but cover employee name, date of birth, employer information, requested services checkboxes, drug/alcohol testing options, and billing information.
- **File size**: 118,574 bytes (reasonable for a 1-page fillable PDF).
- **Page count**: 1 page.
- **Fonts**: 5 embedded fonts.
- **Images**: 2 embedded images (likely the hospital logo and/or decorative elements).
- **Scan status**: Not an image-only scan — this is a natively digital document.

Ironically, this employer form demonstrates that Neshoba General Hospital is technically capable of producing well-designed, fillable PDF forms. The fact that they have not produced (or at least published) an equivalent ROI form for patients is notable.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The employer authorization form is a single-page document with a clear structure:

- **Title**: "EMPLOYER AUTHORIZATION FORM" in prominent header text.
- **Instruction**: "Send this form with employee to preferred Neshoba General facility" — clear and directive.
- **Sections**: Logically organized into Employee Information, Employer Information, Requested Services, Drug and Alcohol Testing, and Billing Information, with an "Internal Use Only" section at the bottom.
- **Checkboxes**: Services are presented as checkbox options (DOT Physical, Pre-Employment Physical, Return to Work Physical, etc.), making selection easy.
- **Layout**: Fields use underline-style blanks with adequate spacing for a single page. The "(please print)" instruction appears where needed.

As a document, it is functional and well-organized for its purpose. But it is the wrong document for patient ROI purposes.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**This document does not serve patients requesting their own health records in any way.** It is exclusively an employer-facing form for occupational health services. It contains:

- No reference to HIPAA, patient rights, or the Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524)
- No scope options for selecting record types or date ranges
- No format/delivery options for receiving health information
- No mention of electronic health information export
- No patient authorization or consent language for releasing medical records
- No designated recipient for released information

The form's "authorization" is for an employer to authorize an employee's visit for workplace medical services — a fundamentally different use case than a patient authorizing the release of their own health information.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

Because this is not an ROI form, standard compliance analysis (barriers to patient access, fee disclosure, expiration terms, consent bundling) does not apply. However, the absence of any online ROI form is itself a compliance-adjacent concern:

- **HIPAA's Right of Access** (45 CFR § 164.524) requires covered entities to act on patient requests for their records. While HIPAA does not explicitly require publishing an ROI form online, making no form available digitally — and having no "Medical Records" page on the website — creates a practical barrier. Patients must call or visit in person just to learn how to initiate a records request.
- The hospital's website lacks even a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices PDF, which covered entities are required to provide and which typically explains how patients can request their records.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No ROI form published anywhere online**: After an exhaustive multi-strategy search (9 web queries, full site navigation, URL guessing, Wayback Machine archive, third-party vendor checks), no patient-facing medical records release form was found. Patients have no way to begin the records request process without contacting the hospital by phone or in person.
- **No Medical Records / HIM page on website**: The website entirely omits any section describing how patients can access their health records, creating a significant practical barrier even before the form question arises.
- **No Notice of Privacy Practices published**: The absence of a publicly available NPP (only a generic website privacy policy exists) means patients cannot easily learn about their HIPAA rights from this provider's website.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **The only "authorization form" found is for a completely different purpose**: A patient searching the site for an authorization form might encounter the Employer Authorization Form and be confused about whether it applies to their records request. The form title ("EMPLOYER AUTHORIZATION FORM") is clear enough, but the absence of the correct form leaves patients with no path forward.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **The employer form demonstrates digital capability**: With 54 fillable fields on a single well-structured page, this form shows the hospital can produce high-quality digital forms. The technical infrastructure exists; it simply has not been applied to patient records access.
