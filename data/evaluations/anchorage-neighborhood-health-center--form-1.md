## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a single-page authorization form titled "Advanced Authorization for Release of Information." It serves as ANHC's primary ROI form, allowing patients to authorize either the *release* of ANHC records to a third party or the *obtaining* of records from an external source into ANHC. The form uses a binary checkbox structure: "☐ Obtain Information from" vs. "☐ Release Information to" with the instruction "PLEASE CHOOSE ONLY ONE PER FORM."

A companion document (form-2.pdf, "PHI Disclosure Agreement," Rev. 8/4/23) is also available. That form serves a different purpose — designating standing proxies for PHI access and MyChart proxy access for minors — rather than requesting specific records. Form-1 is the relevant document for a patient seeking to obtain copies of their own health records.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was located via a site-scoped web search (`site:anhc.org authorization release medical records`), which surfaced the ANHC forms page at https://www.anhc.org/forms. The retrieval notes describe this page as "well-organized with clear section headings," including a dedicated "Request a Release of Information" section with direct PDF links. The form was also available in Spanish, which is notable.

The URL is descriptive (`Advanced-Authorization-for-Release-of-Information-Rev-8-2025.pdf`) and includes a revision date, making it clear what version is being downloaded. There were no bot-blocking mechanisms, authentication requirements, or captchas. The notes indicate the form was found on the third search strategy attempted; generic searches did not surface ANHC-specific results, but the organization's own site made discovery straightforward.

Additionally, the notes mention an alternative text-based ROI request option (text "TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), suggesting ANHC offers multiple pathways.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Pages:** 1
- **File size:** 163,535 bytes (~164 KB) — reasonable for a single-page form
- **Text layer:** Yes — full text is extractable and reads coherently
- **Fillable fields:** 0 — the PDF contains no interactive form fields despite having clearly defined blanks for patient name, DOB, address, etc.
- **Fonts:** 7 distinct fonts used
- **Embedded images:** 9 (likely includes logos, checkboxes, and decorative elements)
- **Image-only scan:** No — this is a digitally composed document, not a scanned paper form

The form is digitally designed rather than scanned, which is positive. However, the complete absence of fillable fields (0 out of what would be approximately 15-20 logical fields) means a patient must print, hand-fill, and then scan/fax/mail the document. For a form revised as recently as August 2025, the lack of any interactive PDF fields is a notable missed opportunity. The extracted text is clean and well-structured, with no OCR artifacts or garbled content.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length and proportion:** The form fits on a single page, which is efficient. However, fitting all content — patient demographics, authorization direction, record type selection, sensitive-information authorization, date ranges, disclosure purpose statement, redisclosure prohibition notice, and signature blocks — onto one page likely results in a cramped layout given the 9 embedded images and 7 fonts.

**Introductory language:** The form opens with a clear, plain-language instruction: "PLEASE READ: You should only fill out this form if you want to have medical or dental information sent to Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC), or if you want information from your ANHC records provided to another source." This effectively frames the form's two purposes.

**Information type selection:** The form provides checkboxes for six specific record types (History and Physical, Progress Notes, Lab Reports, X-Ray Reports, Immunization Records, Medication List) plus an "Other" free-text field. This gives patients reasonable granularity in scoping their request.

**Sensitive information:** A separate section requires additional explicit authorization for three categories: Substance Use Disorder, Mental Health, and HIV-Related Information. These are appropriately segregated per federal and state requirements (42 CFR Part 2 for SUD).

**Date range options:** Two pre-set options — "Records from the past 12 months" and "Records from most recent 3 visits" — plus a free-text "Notes" field. The "past 12 months" option appears pre-checked with an "X" in the extracted text. This is helpful but limited; there's no option for "all records" or a custom date range field (only the notes line).

**Language:** The disclosure/purpose section uses moderately dense but not impenetrable legal language. Key passages are reasonably clear: "I understand that authorizing the disclosure of this health information is voluntary" and "my treatment, health care, and payment for my heath care will not be affected if I do not sign this form."

**Demographics collected:** Patient Name, DOB, Last Four Digits of SS#, Phone, Evening Phone, Address/City/State/Zip. Requesting the last four SSN digits is notable — while common in healthcare, it is not required for a records request and adds friction and data exposure risk.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** The form is a dual-purpose document covering both patient-initiated record requests and third-party releases. The "Obtain" vs. "Release" checkbox structure implies that when a patient wants their own records, they would check "Release Information to" and list themselves (or their personal address) as the recipient. This is functional but not optimized for patient self-service — there is no dedicated "I want my own records" pathway or simplified patient access request form.

**Right of Access reference:** The form explicitly cites HIPAA: "*Note: Per HIPAA guidelines, patients are NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information Individuals' Right under HIPAA to Access their Health Information 45 CFR § 164.524." This is a strong patient-rights statement, directly informing patients they don't need to justify their request. However, the citation formatting is slightly garbled — there appears to be a missing period or line break between "health information" and "Individuals' Right."

**Format/delivery options:** The form provides no options for electronic delivery. There is a fax number field for the recipient, suggesting fax is a supported delivery method for third-party releases, but no mention of email, patient portal download, CD/USB, or other electronic formats.

**Fee disclosure:** The form states: "In order to offset the cost of maintaining and producing copies of the medical record, ANHC does charge for copies. There is no charge for medical records if copies are sent to other health care facilities for ongoing care or follow-up treatment." This acknowledges fees exist but does not specify the amount. Notably, it only mentions free copies for facility-to-facility transfers, not for patient self-access — under HIPAA's Right of Access, fees for patient-requested copies must be limited to a reasonable, cost-based fee.

**Expiration:** The authorization expires "one (1) year after I have signed this form," which is reasonable and clearly stated.

**Revocation:** Clearly stated — the patient may "revoke this authorization at any time by notifying Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center in writing."

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**42 CFR Part 2 (SUD):** The form includes a separate authorization section for Substance Use Disorder information and a full "PROHIBITION OF REDISCLOSURE" notice for 42 CFR Part 2 protected information. This is appropriately handled.

**Fee structure concern:** The fee language draws a distinction between copies sent to healthcare facilities (free) and implicitly all other copies (charged). Under 45 CFR § 164.524(c)(4), patients requesting their own records may only be charged a reasonable, cost-based fee. The form's language could be read to suggest patients requesting their own records face charges, while the free-copy exemption only applies to facility transfers. This could deter patients from exercising their Right of Access.

**SSN collection:** Requesting the "Last Four Digits of SS#" is not a HIPAA requirement for processing a records request. While common as an identity verification aid, it adds unnecessary data collection risk and could be a barrier for patients uncomfortable sharing this information.

**Identity verification:** The form includes an "ID VERIFIED BY ANHC EMPLOYEE" field in the office-use section, which is appropriate. It asks for the employee name, verification method, and initials — suggesting a structured in-person or verifiable process.

**Representative access:** The form notes "Parent/Guardian, or Representative (legal documents required)" — requiring legal documentation for representatives is appropriate and standard.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Explicit HIPAA Right of Access citation:** The form directly quotes 45 CFR § 164.524 and tells patients they are "NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information." This is uncommon and commendable — many ROI forms omit this patient-empowering language entirely.
- **Spanish-language availability:** The notes indicate the ROI form is available in both English and Spanish on the forms page, improving access for non-English-speaking patients.
- **Text-based alternative channel:** The organization offers an alternative ROI request method via text message ("TEXT ME" to 907-743-7200), which is an unusually accessible option, especially for an FQHC serving potentially underserved populations.
- **Recently revised:** The Rev. 08/2025 date indicates the form is actively maintained and current.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Fee applicability to patient self-access unclear:** The form states "ANHC does charge for copies" with an exception only for facility-to-facility transfers. It does not clarify whether patient self-access requests are subject to fees, or what those fees are. Under HIPAA, patient-requested copies have specific fee limitations, and the form's language could discourage patients from requesting their own records.
- **"Obtain" vs. "Release" for patient self-requests:** The dual-purpose form structure doesn't clearly guide a patient who simply wants their own records. Would they check "Release Information to" and list their own name/address? The form's instructions explain the two directions but don't address this common use case.
- **Pre-checked date range:** The extracted text suggests "Records from the past 12 months" may be pre-checked ("X" marker). If the default is pre-selected, patients might inadvertently limit their request without realizing they can request a different scope.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **No fillable PDF fields (Rev. 08/2025):** Despite being revised in August 2025, the form has zero interactive fields. Patients must print, hand-complete, and return the form physically or via fax. For an organization that otherwise shows digital awareness (text-based ROI, MyChart), this is a significant accessibility gap.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Typo in disclosure text:** "payment for my heath care" should read "health care" — a minor but noticeable error in the legal disclosure paragraph.
- **Malformed HIPAA citation:** The sentence "*Note: Per HIPAA guidelines, patients are NOT required to give a purpose for their use of health information Individuals' Right under HIPAA to Access their Health Information 45 CFR § 164.524" appears to run two sentences together without proper punctuation or separation.
