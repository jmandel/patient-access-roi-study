# Evaluation: Community Health Center, Inc. — form-3.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Form-3.pdf is **"Autorización para Divulgar u Obtener Información Médica"** — the Spanish-language translation of CHC's standard Release of Information / Authorization form. It is a direct translation of form-2.pdf (the English version, "Authorization to Release or Obtain Health Information"), sharing the same one-page layout, the same field structure, and the same legal disclosures. It was revised 7/2019 (one month after form-2's 6/2019 revision date).

A third form (form-1.pdf) is a site-specific English variant pre-filled for the "Birth to Three" program referral, dated 10/31/19. The patient forms page on chc1.com has since transitioned to Luma Health online portals, but these older PDFs remain hosted in the WordPress uploads directory.

This document serves dual purposes: authorizing CHC to release records to a third party **or** to obtain records from a third party on the patient's behalf. It also offers a self-request pathway ("En caso de que los registros se me deban entregar A MÍ").

## 2. FINDABILITY

**Moderate difficulty.** The form was not directly linked from CHC's current patient forms page, which now points to Luma Health online portals. The PDF was discoverable only through web search or by guessing the URL pattern (`ROI-Spanish.pdf`) based on the English version's filename (`ROI-English.pdf`). The source URL is `https://www.chc1.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ROI-Spanish.pdf`.

Per the notes, the patient forms page at `https://www.chc1.com/for-patients/resources/patient-forms/` no longer links to these PDFs directly. A Spanish-speaking patient navigating the website would not have a clear path to this document unless they happened upon it through search or were directed by staff. The current Luma Health portal links appear to be English-only based on the notes — it is unclear whether a Spanish-language online form option exists through that system.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **File size**: 177,997 bytes (reasonable for a one-page form)
- **Page count**: 1
- **Text layer**: Present — the document is not a scan. Text is selectable and extractable (confirmed by the 4,742-character full text extraction).
- **Fillable fields**: **0**. The form has no interactive PDF form fields despite having numerous blanks for patient name, dates, addresses, checkboxes, and signatures. All fields are static underscored lines. A patient would need to print, hand-fill, and return the form.
- **Font count**: 4 (minimal, consistent with a simple layout)
- **Embedded images**: 1 (likely a logo or header graphic)
- **Character encoding**: Spanish diacriticals (á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ, °) are properly encoded and extract correctly, which is important for a Spanish-language document.

The lack of fillable fields is a significant accessibility gap — a patient cannot complete this form digitally. Combined with the fact that the form is essentially orphaned (not linked from the current website), a patient would need to print, fill by hand, then either fax to 860-343-7379, mail to 575 Main Street, Middletown, CT 06457, or bring it in person.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Structure and layout**: The form packs all content onto a single page. The dual-purpose layout (release TO vs. obtain FROM) is presented in two side-by-side columns with "O" (Spanish for "OR") between them, mirroring the English version's design. This is reasonably clear.

**Record type checkboxes**: The form offers 9 categories of records plus a free-text "Otros" field:
1. Notas de visita medicas (Progress notes)
2. Notas de Consultas medicas (Consultation notes)
3. Registro medico completo (sin solicitud telefónica) (Complete record without phone encounters)
4. Registro medico completo (con solicitud telefónica) (Complete record with phone encounters)
5. Registros Odontológicos, incluidas radiografías (Dental records including x-rays)
6. Vacunas (Immunizations)
7. Resultados de Radiografías, Tomografías Computarizadas, Resonancias Magnéticas, Ultrasonografías (Imaging results)
8. Resultados de Laboratorio (Lab results)
9. Otros (Other)

**Date range**: Offers a from/to date range, a "from first appointment to today" option, and notes that the default is the last 3 years: "El Departamento de Registros Médicos expedira los 3 ULTIMOS ANOS a menos que un periodo diferente sea especificado en esta solicitud."

**Sensitive information**: Drug/alcohol, psychiatric/behavioral health, and HIV/AIDS data require explicit opt-in checkboxes, with a carve-out allowing patients to exclude specific drug/alcohol information.

**Purpose of request**: Four checkbox options plus free-text: Legal, Traslado de Atención (Transferring Care), Coordinación de Atención (Coordinating Care), Reubicación (Relocation), Otro (Other).

**Legal disclosures**: Four paragraphs covering right to revoke, re-disclosure risk, voluntariness, and the 30-day fulfillment window. These are rendered in small text at the bottom, which is standard practice but makes them harder to read.

**Missing accents and formatting issues**: Several Spanish words are missing diacritical marks that should be present: "medicas" should be "médicas," "INFORMACION" should be "INFORMACIÓN," "ANOS" should be "AÑOS," "expedira" should be "expedirá," "telefonica" should be "telefónica." This suggests the translation was done without careful attention to proper Spanish orthography.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Self-request pathway**: The form explicitly supports patients requesting their own records via the "En caso de que los registros se me deban entregar A MÍ" section, offering four delivery methods: Correo (Mail), Fax, Punto de recogida (Pick-up), and Correo electrónico (Email). The email option is a positive feature.

**Language accessibility**: The existence of a Spanish-language form is itself a patient-centered feature, particularly for an FQHC in Connecticut serving a population that includes Spanish speakers. However, the quality of the translation is undermined by the missing accents noted above.

**Comprehension level**: The legal disclosure paragraphs are dense and written in formal/legal Spanish. Phrases like "Comprendo que la revocación no regirá para mi compañía de seguros en caso de que las leyes le concedan a mi aseguradora el derecho a refutar una reclamación bajo mi póliza de seguro" are complex even for fluent Spanish speakers. No plain-language summary is provided.

**Expiration**: The 90-day default authorization expiration is disclosed, with the option for the patient to specify a different date or event.

**30-day fulfillment**: The form states "CHC tiene 30 días para satisfacer mi solicitud" — a 30-day fulfillment window, which is at the outer edge of the HIPAA-permitted timeframe (30 days with one 30-day extension).

**No fee disclosure**: The form does not mention any fees or costs associated with records requests.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

- **Reason for request**: The form asks patients to indicate why they are requesting records ("FIRMO ESTA AUTORIZACIÓN POR EL SIGUIENTE MOTIVO"). Under HIPAA, patients exercising their right of access are not required to provide a reason. However, this form bundles release-to-third-party and self-request on the same form, and reason-for-request is more standard for third-party releases. Still, a patient using the self-request pathway may feel obligated to justify their request.
- **Sensitive information opt-in**: The separate consent required for drug/alcohol, psychiatric, and HIV/AIDS information aligns with 42 CFR Part 2 and state confidentiality laws. The form appropriately requires explicit checkboxes for each category.
- **Revocation rights**: Properly disclosed — must be in writing to the Medical Records Department.
- **Voluntariness**: The form states "No es necesario que firme este formulario para garantizar mi tratamiento médico," correctly advising that signing is not a condition of treatment.
- **Default 3-year scope**: The form defaults to releasing only the last 3 years of records unless the patient specifies otherwise. This could be a barrier for patients seeking their complete record, particularly if they don't read the fine print or don't specify a broader date range.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### ❌ ERRORS
- Multiple missing Spanish diacritical marks throughout the form: "medicas" (should be "médicas"), "INFORMACION" (should be "INFORMACIÓN"), "ANOS" (should be "AÑOS"), "expedira" (should be "expedirá"), "telefonica/telefónica" used inconsistently. This undermines the professionalism and readability of the Spanish translation.
- The English form-2 (Rev. 6/2019) contains the typo "in response to his authorization" instead of "this authorization." The Spanish form-3 (Rev. 7/2019) translates this correctly as "en virtud de esta autorización," suggesting the translator caught the English typo but it was never fixed in the English version.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- The form combines patient self-request (right of access) with third-party release authorization on a single document. It is not clear to a patient whether this is the correct form for simply requesting their own records vs. authorizing disclosure to another provider. The self-request option is presented as a delivery sub-option rather than a distinct pathway.
- "Registro medico completo (sin solicitud telefónica)" vs. "(con solicitud telefónica)" — the distinction between "complete health record without telephone encounters" and "with telephone encounters" is unexplained and may confuse patients who don't know what "telephone encounters" means in a medical records context.

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- The default 3-year records scope limitation ("El Departamento de Registros Médicos expedira los 3 ULTIMOS ANOS") could function as a barrier for patients who don't realize they need to explicitly request a broader range. Under HIPAA, patients have a right to their entire designated record set, not just the last 3 years.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- Providing a Spanish-language version of the ROI form at all is commendable, especially for an FQHC serving a diverse population. Many organizations offer English-only forms.
- The form offers email as a delivery option for self-requests, which is relatively uncommon and reduces barriers for patients who prefer electronic delivery.
- The Spanish translation correctly fixed the "his/this" typo present in the English version's legal disclosures.
