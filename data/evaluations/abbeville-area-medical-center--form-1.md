# Evaluation: Abbeville Area Medical Center — form-1.pdf

## DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is a one-page "AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION" form (form number HIM 1022, dated 07/23/2019). It is the primary ROI form for the organization, linked directly from the Medical Records page. The file was uploaded to the website in January 2023, replacing a 2019 version. A second document found on the site (form-2.pdf) is a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices brochure, not an ROI form. This authorization form is the sole mechanism for patients to request release of their health records from Abbeville Area Medical Center.

## FINDABILITY

**Rating: Good.** The form was easy to locate. Per the retrieval notes, it is reachable in 2–3 clicks from the homepage via Home → Patients & Visitors → Medical Records. The source URL (`/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HIM-1022-authorization.pdf`) is descriptive enough to identify the document's purpose. Site-specific web searches also returned direct links. No login, CAPTCHA, or bot-blocking was encountered. The medical records page links directly to the PDF download.

## TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (2,731 characters). This is not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (0) interactive form fields. Despite having blank lines and checkboxes visible in the PDF, none are digitally fillable. The checkboxes (`□ History & Physical`, `□ Discharge Summary`, etc.) are static Unicode characters, not interactive controls. A patient would need to print and hand-fill this form.
- **File size**: 230 KB for a single page, which is moderate — likely due to the embedded image (1 embedded image, possibly a logo). Acceptable but slightly large for one page of content.
- **Font count**: 7 fonts used, suggesting reasonable formatting structure.
- **Digital-first design**: No. This is clearly designed as a print-and-fill form. The blank lines (`_________________`), static checkboxes, and physical signature lines all assume pen-on-paper completion. There is no indication of electronic submission capability.

## CONTENT DESIGN

**Length**: One page — concise and proportionate for a basic authorization form. All content fits on a single sheet, which is convenient for patients.

**Organization**: The form follows a logical numbered structure:
1. Authorization/recipient identification
2. Date records were printed/requested
3. Record type selection (checkboxes)
4. Purpose of disclosure
5. Legal disclosures and signature block

**Clarity**: The language is a mix of plain language and legal boilerplate. The top section is straightforward ("I authorize Abbeville Area Medical Center… to disclose Protected Health Information"). The bottom section shifts to denser legal text covering revocation, re-disclosure, and fax risks. The sentence "I understand that if the organization or individual authorized to receive the information is not a health plan or health care provider, the released information may no longer be protected by federal privacy regulations" is appropriate but may challenge low-literacy readers.

**Record type options**: The form offers 16 specific record type checkboxes plus an "Other" field:
- History & Physical, Discharge Summary, Operative Report(s), Pathology Report(s), Physician Orders, Progress Notes, Consultation(s), ER Record, Nurse's Notes, MAR(s), Lab(s), Radiology Report(s), EKG/EEG(s), Stress Thallium/Test(s), Respiratory Report(s), Physical Therapy Record(s), Other

This is a granular selection — useful for targeted requests, though there is no "All Records" or "Complete Medical Record" checkbox option, which could frustrate patients seeking everything.

**Layout**: Functional but dense for a single page. The asterisks with "* Must Have Information" at the bottom mark required fields, but this convention is only explained at the very bottom of the page — easily overlooked.

## PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is framed as a general release authorization ("I authorize Abbeville Area Medical Center… to disclose Protected Health Information… to the following individual or group"). It does not distinguish between a patient requesting their own records and a third-party release. There is no specific pathway, language, or form tailored for patient self-access under HIPAA § 164.524. A patient requesting their own records would need to fill in their own name as both the patient and the recipient, which is awkward.

**Scope options**: Good granularity — 16 record-type checkboxes plus "Other," date-of-service fields (two rows with account numbers), and a purpose field. Date ranges and specific visit selection are supported.

**Format options**: None mentioned. There is no option for electronic delivery, patient portal access, email, CD, or USB. The form references "Date records were printed and/or CD was requested" in item 2, suggesting records may be available on CD, but this is not presented as a patient choice — it appears to be an internal tracking field.

**Right of Access language**: Absent. There is no reference to HIPAA § 164.524, patient rights, or the right to access one's own records. The HIPAA brochure (form-2.pdf) mentions the right to inspect and obtain copies and the right to electronic copies, but the ROI form itself contains no such guidance.

**EHI Export awareness**: None. No mention of electronic health information export, bulk data, or patient portal alternatives.

## COMPLIANCE

**Expiration**: The authorization expires after 90 days: "this authorization will expire ninety (90) days from the date it is signed." This is a relatively short window. While not per se illegal, it places time pressure on the organization to process the request and could require patients to resubmit if processing is delayed.

**Revocation**: Revocation must be "in writing" — standard and compliant.

**Sensitive information**: The form includes blanket consent for sensitive categories: "This includes specific permission to release medical information pertaining to psychological, psychiatric or other mental impairment(s), drug abuse, alcoholism, or other substance abuse, sickle cell anemia, HIV infection (including AIDS or tests for HIV) or sexually transmitted diseases." This is bundled into the main authorization rather than offered as a separate opt-in, meaning patients cannot easily exclude sensitive records from their release.

**Conditioning treatment**: The form correctly states: "I understand that any treatment I may receive may not be conditioned on whether I sign this authorization."

**Fees**: No fee schedule or cost information is disclosed on the form.

**Submission method**: No instructions on how or where to submit the completed form (no address, fax number, email, or drop-off location on the form itself).

## NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS
- **Bundled sensitive-information consent**: The form automatically includes release of psychiatric, substance abuse, HIV, and STD records with no opt-out mechanism. Patients who want their general medical records but wish to exclude sensitive categories have no way to do so. Some state laws (e.g., 42 CFR Part 2 for substance abuse) may require separate, specific consent for these categories.
- **No submission instructions**: The form provides no address, fax number, email, or department contact for submitting the completed authorization. A patient printing this from the website would not know where to send it.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES
- **"Date records were printed and/or CD was requested"** (item 2): This field's purpose is unclear. It appears to be an internal-use field for staff to note when records were produced, but it is numbered as if it's something the patient should fill in. Its placement between the recipient field and the record-type selection is confusing.
- **Patient self-access unclear**: The form does not clarify whether it should be used by patients requesting their own records or only for authorizing release to third parties. The "Name/Facility" recipient field implies a third party.
- **Picture ID requirement**: The form header includes "*Picture ID" as a required field but provides no context — it's unclear whether this means the patient must present ID in person, attach a copy, or something else.

### ❌ ERRORS
- **Form date discrepancy**: The form footer reads "07/23/2019" but was uploaded to the website in January 2023. If the 2023 upload was intended to be an updated version, the revision date was not changed, making it unclear whether any substantive updates were made.
- **No "All Records" option**: While not technically an error, the absence of a complete-record checkbox alongside 16 granular options is a notable design gap for patients seeking comprehensive access.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS
- **Single-page brevity**: The form fits everything on one page, reducing burden on patients. Many ROI forms are 2–4 pages.
- **Fax copy equivalence**: "A faxed copy of this release shall be deemed as having the same effect as the original" — this is patient-friendly, allowing remote submission without originals.
- **Granular record-type selection**: The 16 checkboxes give patients meaningful control over what specific records are released, which supports informed, targeted authorization.
