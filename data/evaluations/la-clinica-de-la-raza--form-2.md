# Evaluation: La Clínica de La Raza — form-2.pdf

## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is an **"Authorization to Release Information"** form, dated August 2022 (filename: "Release-of-Information-0822-English"). It is a 2-page PDF (251 KB) with a text layer but no fillable fields. The form header contains fields marked "PCP:" and "PCD:" along with "OR" — indicating it originates from **La Clinica Health Centers in Oregon**, not La Clínica de La Raza in Oakland, CA.

This is critically important context: **this form belongs to the wrong organization**. It was downloaded from `laclinicahealth.org`, which is La Clinica Health Centers (Medford, Oregon) — a completely separate entity from the study subject, La Clínica de La Raza (Oakland, CA, `laclinica.org`). The notes.md confirms this confusion arose because search engines consistently conflated the two similarly-named organizations.

Among the three documents retrieved for this organization:
- **form-1.pdf**: Also from the wrong organization (La Clinica del Valle, Oregon, 2015 revision)
- **form-2.pdf** (this document): Wrong organization (La Clinica Health Centers, Oregon, 2022 revision)
- **form-3.pdf**: Correct organization — La Clínica de La Raza's Notice of Privacy Practices

Form-2 appears to be an updated version of form-1, both from the Oregon organization. Neither is actually used by La Clínica de La Raza.

## 2. FINDABILITY

This form was **not findable for the intended organization**. It was retrieved only because web searches for "La Clínica de La Raza" ROI forms returned results from `laclinicahealth.org` (Oregon) instead. Multiple search strategies were attempted for the correct organization:

- Filetype-specific web searches returned only the Oregon organization's forms
- Direct navigation of `laclinica.org` found no medical records request page or ROI form
- URL guessing on common PDF paths returned 404 errors
- Wayback Machine searches found no archived ROI forms

La Clínica de La Raza does not appear to publish any ROI form online. Their Notice of Privacy Practices (form-3) directs patients to write to their Privacy Officer at a P.O. Box. Patients would need to call (510-535-4000) or visit a clinic to obtain a form. This represents a significant findability failure — not for form-2 itself (which belongs to another organization), but for the actual study subject.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

Evaluating form-2 on its technical merits as a document (setting aside the wrong-organization issue):

- **Text layer**: Present — full text is extractable (4,612 characters). Not an image-only scan.
- **Fillable fields**: Zero (`fillable_field_count: 0`). Despite being a digitally-created PDF with 8 fonts and 9 embedded images, the form has no interactive form fields. Patients must print and fill by hand.
- **File size**: 251 KB for 2 pages — reasonable, though the 9 embedded images suggest visual elements (logos, design graphics) that add bulk.
- **Digital design**: The text extraction is clean and well-structured, suggesting this was created digitally (not scanned). However, the lack of fillable fields means it functions as a print-only document despite being natively digital.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

The form is organized into 6 numbered sections across 2 pages, which provides reasonable structure:

1. **Release FROM** (source of records) — name, address, phone/fax fields
2. **Release TO** (destination) — same field set, plus "Place Site Location Stamp Here"
3. **Purpose** — 6 checkbox options: Continuity of Care, Copies for Own Use, Insurance, Legal, Transfer Care, Other
4. **Information Requested** — 9 checkbox categories including "Complete Medical Record – Past Two Years," "Laboratory Reports," "Imaging Report(s)," "Immunizations," "Counseling/Mental Health Support," "Medication Records," plus date range fields
5. **Format selection** — checkboxes for MyChart, Mail, Pick up, Fax, Protected email, Unprotected email (with initials for risk acknowledgment)
6. **Sensitive information** — 7 categories requiring separate initials: Drug Use, Alcohol Use, STD, HIV/AIDS, Genetic Testing, Sickle Cell Anemia, Mental Health

Page 2 contains an "I UNDERSTAND THAT" section with legal disclosures, signature block, and staff-use-only processing section.

The language is mostly clear, with helpful parenthetical guidance like "(Who has the information you want released? Please list the specific hospital or clinic.)" and "(Where do you want the information sent or who may have the information?)". The legal section on page 2 uses longer sentences but includes specific CFR citations (45 CFR§164.508).

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release**: The form is structured as a general authorization for releasing records from one entity to another. It is not specifically designed for patient self-access requests under HIPAA's Right of Access (45 CFR § 164.524). However, the "Copies for Own Use" checkbox under purpose (Section 3) does accommodate this use case.

**Scope options**: Good granularity — patients can select from 9 specific record types, request complete records for the past two years, and specify a date range. The dental records option "(Including radiographs)" shows attention to completeness.

**Format options**: Notably strong — Section 5 offers 6 delivery methods: MyChart (patient portal), Mail, Pick up (with location specification), Fax, Protected email, and Unprotected email. The unprotected email option includes an informed consent mechanism: "Initials: ________I understand that not encrypting email increases the risk that information could be accessed by a third party while in transit."

**Right of Access language**: The form references 45 CFR§164.508 (authorization provisions) but does not reference 45 CFR § 164.524 (patient right of access). This is a third-party release authorization form, not a right-of-access request form.

**EHI Export**: No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Sensitive information protections**: The form lists 7 categories of sensitive information requiring separate initialing, which aligns with stricter state and federal protections for substance abuse, HIV, genetic testing, and mental health records. The warning "Sensitive information listed below will not be shared unless initialed" is prominently placed.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Authorization vs. Right of Access**: The form is structured as a §164.508 authorization rather than a §164.524 right-of-access request. For patients requesting their own records, this is a significant distinction — right of access requests have stronger protections (30-day response deadline, limited fee structure, fewer permissible reasons for denial).

**Expiration**: "This authorization shall expire one (1) year after the date signed unless a different expiration date is written here." One year is a reasonable default.

**Revocation rights**: The form states patients "may cancel this authorization at any time by submitting a written request or by completing the La Clinica Revocation of Authorization form." This is appropriate.

**Conditioning of treatment**: The form properly states "Choosing not to sign will not affect me from receiving health care or reimbursement for services," consistent with HIPAA requirements.

**Witness requirement**: The signature block includes "Witness Signature (when signed in office)" — this is qualified ("when signed in office") rather than universally required, which is reasonable.

**Accounting of disclosures**: The form informs patients of the right to "receive a copy of a list of any 12-month period and it will be provided at no cost," which is a helpful transparency measure.

**School-based health centers**: Contains a specific provision: "In La Clinica's school-based health centers, protected information will be used or shared only when necessary to help a purpose that is related to the health and protection of a child's wellbeing and ability to learn and succeed." This applies to the Oregon organization.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Wrong organization entirely**: This form belongs to La Clinica Health Centers (Oregon), not La Clínica de La Raza (Oakland, CA). It cannot be used by patients of the study subject. The fact that the actual organization publishes no ROI form online is itself a significant barrier to patient access.
- **Authorization form used for patient self-access**: By framing all record requests as §164.508 authorizations rather than §164.524 right-of-access requests, the form potentially subjects patient self-access to more restrictive rules than HIPAA requires.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **"Place Site Location Stamp Here"** appears in Sections 1 and 2 — this language assumes staff will stamp a pre-printed location, making the form less usable for patients completing it independently at home.
- **"PCP:" and "PCD:" and "OR"** at the top of the form are unexplained abbreviations that would confuse patients (these appear to be internal routing codes for Primary Care Provider, Primary Care Department, and Oregon).

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Multiple delivery format options**: The inclusion of MyChart, protected email, unprotected email (with informed consent), mail, fax, and pickup is notably comprehensive — more format options than many ROI forms offer.
- **Helpful parenthetical instructions**: The guidance text like "(Who has the information you want released? Please list the specific hospital or clinic.)" provides plain-language clarification within what could otherwise be confusing legal structure.
- **Granular sensitive-information consent**: The 7-category initialing system for sensitive information respects both patient autonomy and legal requirements for specially-protected data categories.
