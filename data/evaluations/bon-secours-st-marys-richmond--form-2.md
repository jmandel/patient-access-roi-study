## 1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This is the **Spanish-language version** of Bon Secours Richmond's system-wide Authorization to Disclose Health Information form, titled "AUTORIZACIÓN PARA DIVULGAR INFORMACIÓN MÉDICA." It carries form ID BSR-MR-50SPN and is dated 11/17 (November 2017). It is the direct translation of form-1.pdf, the English-language version (BSR-MR-50, dated 1/21 — January 2021).

The form is used across all Bon Secours Richmond-area facilities (St. Mary's, Memorial Regional, Richmond Community Hospital, St. Francis, etc.), not solely for St. Mary's. It is a general-purpose ROI/authorization form for disclosing health information to a designated recipient — it is **not** a patient-access-specific form designed for patients requesting their own records under HIPAA's Right of Access.

Notably, the English version (form-1) was updated in January 2021, while this Spanish version still carries the November 2017 date. This version discrepancy means the Spanish form may not reflect any updates made to the English form over the intervening ~3 years.

## 2. FINDABILITY

The form was straightforward to locate. A simple web search for Bon Secours authorization/release forms immediately surfaced the Bon Secours medical records request page at `https://www.bonsecours.com/patient-resources/request-medical-records`. Both English and Spanish PDFs are directly linked from that page. The URL path (`roi-spanish-2017.ashx`) is reasonably descriptive, clearly indicating it is a Spanish ROI form. However, the "2017" in the URL suggests aging content that may not have been revisited.

No bot blocking, login, or JavaScript rendering issues were encountered. The form required no more than 1–2 clicks from the medical records page. The retrieval notes confirm: "None" under Difficulties.

## 3. TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY

**Text layer:** The PDF has an extractable text layer — it is not a scan. All 3,463 characters of text are machine-readable, which is important for assistive technology and for copying content.

**Fillable fields:** The form has **zero fillable fields**. All data entry areas (patient name, DOB, address, checkboxes for record types, disclosure format, signature lines) must be completed by hand after printing. This is a flat, print-oriented PDF that cannot be filled digitally.

**File format:** PDF version 1.6, 69,246 bytes for a single page. The file is slightly larger than its English counterpart (55,110 bytes), which is expected given the generally longer text of Spanish translations. Five fonts are embedded, no images. This is a cleanly constructed digital document — not a scanned paper form.

**Digital-first design:** While the underlying PDF is digitally constructed (not a scan), it is functionally a **print-first** document. Users must print, fill by hand, sign, and submit physically or by fax. The absence of any fillable fields means it offers no digital workflow advantage over a blank piece of paper.

## 4. CONTENT DESIGN

**Length:** The form fits on a single page, which is commendable for a document of this type. It covers patient identification, record type selection, recipient information, disclosure format, purpose, and authorization terms — all without requiring a second page.

**Organization:** The form follows a logical top-to-bottom flow: patient demographics → what to release → to whom → how → why → legal terms → signature. This structure is intuitive.

**Clarity and language:** The authorization terms (items 1–4) are written in formal legal Spanish. The language is generally accurate but dense. For example: "Comprendo que cualquier divulgación de información conlleva la posibilidad de una nueva divulgación no autorizada y que la información puede no estar protegida por normas de confidencialidad." This is a direct, literal translation from the English and reads as legalese rather than plain language. It would be challenging for a patient with limited formal education to parse.

**Translation quality issues:** Several fields remain partially or fully in English, creating a confusing bilingual hybrid:
- "Anesthesia Record" is not translated (appears identically in both forms)
- "MyChart Communication" remains in English
- "Radiology Film/CD" remains in English
- "MyChart" remains in English (arguably a brand name)
- "e Delivery by Ciox" appears as "Entrega por medios electrónicos por Ciox" — translated
- The footer section "DEPARTMENT USE ONLY" / "PROCESSED BY:" / "IDENTITY VERIFIED" / "SIGNATURE VERIFIED" remains entirely in English

**Layout:** The single-page format keeps things compact. Checkbox options are organized in a columnar layout for record types. The legal text at the bottom is set in smaller type to fit within the page, which may challenge readability.

## 5. PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS

**Patient access vs. third-party release:** This is a **general disclosure authorization** form, not a patient-access-specific form. The structure asks the patient to authorize disclosure "to" a named recipient, which frames the transaction as a third-party release. A patient requesting their own records must name themselves as the recipient, which is conceptually awkward and does not align with HIPAA's Right of Access framework (45 CFR § 164.524). The form does not distinguish between patient self-requests and third-party disclosures.

**Scope options:** The form offers granular record-type selection via checkboxes: Extracto del expediente (Abstract), Anesthesia Record, Informe operativo (Operative Report), MyChart Communication, Expediente completo (Entire Record), Expediente del Departamento de emergencias (ED Record), Informe de radiografías o de imágenes (X-rays/Imaging), Registro de inmunizaciones (Immunization Record), Resumen del alta (Discharge Summary), Resultados de laboratorio (Lab Results), plus two "Otro" (Other) write-in fields. A "Fecha(s) del servicio" (Date of Visit) field allows date-range scoping. This is a reasonable set of granularity options.

**Format options:** The form offers five disclosure format choices:
- Correo estadounidense (US Mail)
- Formato electrónico: CD/DVD
- Radiology Film/CD
- MyChart
- "Entrega por medios electrónicos por Ciox (exclusivo para pacientes)" with an email address field

The Ciox/eDelivery option is marked as "exclusivo para pacientes" (for patients only), which is a useful distinction. However, no explanation of what Ciox is or how eDelivery works is provided on the form itself.

**Right of Access language:** Item 2 of the authorization terms explicitly references CFR 164.524: "Entiendo que puedo inspeccionar u obtener una copia de la información que se usará o se divulgará, tal como se establece en la Sección 164.524 del Código de Regulaciones Federal (CRF, en inglés)." This is a positive inclusion, though it refers to the right to inspect information being disclosed rather than framing the form itself as a Right of Access mechanism.

**EHI Export:** No mention of electronic health information export or bulk data access.

**Multilingual access:** The mere existence of this Spanish-language form is a patient-centered feature. Bon Secours provides both English and Spanish versions from the same download page, which is better than the majority of providers.

## 6. COMPLIANCE

**Expiration:** The form states: "Salvo que esta autorización se revoque, vencerá una vez transcurridos 6 meses a partir de la fecha de la firma." (Unless revoked, this authorization expires 6 months from signature date.) A 6-month expiration is standard and reasonable.

**Fees:** Item 4 states: "Comprendo que se aplicarán cargos por el copiado, de acuerdo con la política del hospital." ("I understand that copying charges will be applied, according to hospital policy.") No specific fee amounts are disclosed, and no distinction is made between patient-access fees (which HIPAA limits to a reasonable, cost-based fee) and third-party release fees. The blanket statement about "copying charges" applied "according to hospital policy" could lead patients to believe they must pay whatever the hospital decides, without awareness of HIPAA fee limits.

**Revocation rights:** Item 3 clearly explains the right to revoke authorization in writing, including the limitation that revocation does not apply to already-disclosed information or insurance company rights. This is standard and appropriately communicated.

**Voluntariness:** Item 2 states: "Entiendo que autorizar la divulgación de esta información médica es un acto voluntario. Puedo negarme a firmar esta autorización. No necesito firmar este formulario para garantizar este tratamiento." This correctly notes that signing is voluntary and not required for treatment.

**Sensitive information:** Item 1 notes that the disclosure may include STD, AIDS/HIV, behavioral/mental health, and alcohol/drug treatment information, with a "Special Instructions" area for limitations. This is an appropriate notice under state and federal law.

## 7. NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS

### 🚩 RED FLAGS

- **Vague fee disclosure:** The statement "se aplicarán cargos por el copiado, de acuerdo con la política del hospital" provides no fee amounts or limits, and makes no distinction between patient-access copying (HIPAA-limited) and third-party release fees. A Spanish-speaking patient would have no basis to know their HIPAA rights regarding fee caps, and the phrasing implies open-ended charges at the hospital's discretion.

### ⚠️ AMBIGUITIES

- **Not a patient-access form:** The form is structured as a third-party disclosure authorization. A patient requesting their own records must awkwardly list themselves as the "Persona/Centro que recibe la información" (recipient). There is no clear path or instruction for patient self-requests, which may confuse patients who simply want a copy of their own records.
- **Purpose checkbox "Personal":** While a "Personal" purpose option exists, it is not explained — patients may not know whether checking this box triggers a different fee structure or process than other purposes.

### ❌ ERRORS

- **Version lag:** The Spanish form (BSR-MR-50SPN) is dated **11/17** (November 2017), while the English version (BSR-MR-50) is dated **1/21** (January 2021). The Spanish form has not been updated in over 3 years relative to its English counterpart. Any changes made to the English version between 2017 and 2021 are not reflected in this Spanish translation, potentially creating legal or procedural discrepancies between the two versions.
- **Untranslated fields:** Multiple field labels remain in English within the Spanish form: "Anesthesia Record," "MyChart Communication," "Radiology Film/CD," and the entire "DEPARTMENT USE ONLY" footer block. While some of these may be intentional (brand names like MyChart), "Anesthesia Record" is a standard medical term with a ready Spanish equivalent ("Registro de anestesia") and its non-translation appears to be an oversight.
- **Parenthetical typo in disclosure format:** The line "Forma de divulgación (Impresa, por defecto, si no se indica)):" contains a **double closing parenthesis**.

### ✨ BRIGHT SPOTS

- **Spanish-language availability:** Offering an ROI form in Spanish is a genuine patient-centered practice that many healthcare providers do not provide. Having it directly linked alongside the English version on the medical records page is commendable.
- **eDelivery option for patients:** The form specifically notes that electronic delivery via Ciox is "exclusivo para pacientes," indicating an awareness that patients may want a digital delivery channel distinct from mail or physical media.
- **Explicit CFR 164.524 reference:** The form cites the specific federal regulation giving patients the right to inspect or copy their health information, which is an uncommon and positive inclusion — especially notable in a Spanish-language form where patients may have less awareness of their HIPAA rights.
- **Single-page design:** Fitting all necessary content (demographics, record selection, delivery options, legal terms, signature) onto one page reduces barriers to completion.
